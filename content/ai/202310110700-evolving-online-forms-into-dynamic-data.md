Since 2012, Typeform has been revolutionizing the way businesses collect information from their customers. Co-founder David Okuniev has always believed forms should be as engaging and natural as possible. The company is known for pioneering the approach of asking one question at a time, the way humans do.

When it comes to making forms more like human conversations, Typeform has taken a dramatic leap forward with [Formless⁠(opens in a new window)](https://formless.ai/), its AI-powered platform that’s currently in beta.

Formless represents an entirely new way of gathering data—as the name implies, it doesn’t require a traditional form structure at all. Instead, the business user simply provides basic instructions, including what information to collect. The platform, built with OpenAI’s GPT‑3.5 Turbo model as well as GPT‑4, handles the rest.

On the respondent’s side, the experience mimics a real conversation, where the next question is a reaction to the previous answer. And it’s a two-way conversation: respondents can ask their own follow-up questions, just like they would when talking to a person.

Formless was built from the ground up on OpenAI’s newest models, and most likely wouldn’t be possible without GPT‑4. It’s a significant achievement for the Typeform team, whose investment in OpenAI’s technology isn’t new. “We've been working with GPT since 2.0, when the team was working on VideoAsk.com,” said Oji Udezue, Chief Product Officer. “And now: Formless.ai. Formless is our revolutionary new product that makes forms basically disappear entirely. It's the culmination of our obsession with making the web itself more conversational—and we’ve only just scratched the surface.”
