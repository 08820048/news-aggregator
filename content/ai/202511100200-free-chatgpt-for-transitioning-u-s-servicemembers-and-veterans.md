Every year, hundreds of thousands of U.S. servicemembers transition from military to civilian life. It’s a big change with lots of promise, but there’s also a lot to figure out: job hunting, evaluating education options, navigating earned benefits, housing, finances, and getting used to a new routine. Nearly half of post-9/11 veterans say their adjustment to civilian life was difficult. 

OpenAI’s mission is to ensure that AI tools benefit all of humanity, and that includes making the transition a little easier for those who have served.

Today we’re announcing that U.S. servicemembers and veterans can receive a free year of ChatGPT Plus if they’re within 12 months of retirement or separation. This initiative originated with veterans working at OpenAI who use these tools every day. They know firsthand how ChatGPT can help with the next chapter, from building resumes to exploring new careers.

With free ChatGPT Plus access, transitioning servicemembers will be able to:

-   Write and adapt a resume so your military experience shows clearly in civilian terms
-   Practice interviews with realistic questions and feedback
-   Get straightforward explanations of benefits, forms and paperwork
-   Make concrete plans for housing, education, relocation and finances
-   Use the support anytime—no waiting, no appointment needed

U.S. servicemembers and veterans who are interested can learn more [here⁠(opens in a new window)](https://chatgpt.com/veterans-claim). They will get access to our latest models and features, [100 example chats⁠(opens in a new window)](https://chatgpt.com/use-cases/veterans) for veterans (written by OpenAI veterans), and a [customized getting started video⁠(opens in a new window)](https://academy.openai.com/home/resources/veterans) tailored to veterans and hosted on the OpenAI Academy. And we’re doing this alongside SheerID—leveraging their permission-based verification platform to make sure the access goes to those who’ve served and are transitioning to their next stage of life.

The leadership, discipline, and adaptability veterans bring to everything they do have shaped this country, and they deserve tools that match that strength. This initiative is our small way of saying thank you to those who have served. We hope it will help them move forward more easily into this next chapter.
