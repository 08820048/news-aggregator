Over the past year, industry has driven significant advances in the capabilities of AI. As those advances have accelerated, new academic research into AI safety is required. To address this gap, the Forum and philanthropic partners are creating a new AI Safety Fund, which will support independent researchers from around the world affiliated with academic institutions, research institutions, and startups. The initial funding commitment for the AI Safety Fund comes from Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI, and the generosity of our philanthropic partners, the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation[A](#citation-bottom-A), Eric Schmidt, and Jaan Tallinn. Together this amounts to over $10 million in initial funding. We are expecting additional contributions from other partners.

Earlier this year, the members of the Forum signed on to voluntary AI commitments at the White House, which included a pledge to facilitate third-party discovery and reporting of vulnerabilities in our AI systems. The Forum views the AI Safety Fund as an important part of fulfilling this commitment by providing the external community with funding to better evaluate and understand frontier systems. The global discussion on AI safety and the general AI knowledge base will benefit from a wider range of voices and perspectives. 

The primary focus of the Fund will be supporting the development of new model evaluations and techniques for red teaming AI models to help develop and test evaluation techniques for potentially dangerous capabilities of frontier systems. We believe that increased funding in this area will help raise safety and security standards and provide insights into the mitigations and controls industry, governments, and civil society need to respond to the challenges presented by AI systems. 

The Fund will put out a call for proposals within the next few months. Meridian Institute will administer the Fund—their work will be supported by an advisory committee comprised of independent external experts, experts from AI companies, and individuals with experience in grantmaking.
