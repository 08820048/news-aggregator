Get enterprise-grade security & privacy and the most powerful version of ChatGPT yet.

We’re launching ChatGPT Enterprise, which offers enterprise-grade security and privacy, unlimited higher-speed GPT‑4 access, longer context windows for processing longer inputs, advanced data analysis capabilities, customization options, and much more. We believe AI can assist and elevate every aspect of our working lives and make teams more creative and productive. Today marks another step towards an AI assistant for work that helps with any task, is customized for your organization, and that protects your company data.

Since ChatGPT’s launch just nine months ago, we’ve seen teams adopt it in over 80% of Fortune 500 companies.[A](#citation-bottom-A) We’ve heard from business leaders that they’d like a simple and safe way of deploying it in their organization. Early users of ChatGPT Enterprise—industry leaders like Block, Canva, Carlyle, The Estée Lauder Companies, PwC, and Zapier—are redefining how they operate and are using ChatGPT to craft clearer communications, accelerate coding tasks, rapidly explore answers to complex business questions, assist with creative work, and much more.

> “At Klarna, we are constantly seeking innovative solutions to strengthen our employees’ abilities and enable them to best serve our 150 million active users across the globe. With the integration of ChatGPT Enterprise, we’re aimed at achieving a new level of employee empowerment, enhancing both our team’s performance and the customer experience.”

Sebastian Siemiatkowski, CEO at Klarna

You own and control your business data in ChatGPT Enterprise. We do **not** train on your business data or conversations, and our models don’t learn from your usage. ChatGPT Enterprise is also SOC 2 compliant and all conversations are encrypted in transit and at rest. Our new admin console lets you manage team members easily and offers domain verification, SSO, and usage insights, allowing for large-scale deployment into enterprise. See our [privacy page⁠](https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy/) and our [Trust Portal⁠(opens in a new window)](https://trust.openai.com/) for more details on how we treat your data.

ChatGPT Enterprise removes all usage caps, and performs up to two times faster. We include 32k context in Enterprise, allowing users to process four times longer inputs or files. ChatGPT Enterprise also provides unlimited access to advanced data analysis, previously known as [Code Interpreter⁠](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-plugins/). This feature enables both technical and non-technical teams to analyze information in seconds, whether it’s for financial researchers crunching market data, marketers analyzing survey results, or data scientists debugging an ETL script. If you’re looking to tailor ChatGPT to your organization, you can use our new shared chat templates to collaborate and build common workflows. If you need to extend OpenAI into a fully custom solution for your org, our pricing includes free credits to use our [API⁠(opens in a new window)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction) as well.

> “ChatGPT Enterprise has cut down research time by an average of an hour per day, increasing productivity for people on our team. It’s been a powerful tool that has accelerated testing hypotheses and improving our internal systems.”

Jorge Zuniga, Head of Data Systems and Integrations at Asana
