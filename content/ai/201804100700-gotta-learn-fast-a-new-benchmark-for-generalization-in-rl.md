## Abstract

In this report, we present a new reinforcement learning (RL) benchmark based on the Sonic the Hedgehog™ video game franchise. This benchmark is intended to measure the performance of transfer learning and few-shot learning algorithms in the RL domain. We also present and evaluate some baseline algorithms on the new benchmark.
