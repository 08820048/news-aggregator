We’ve [hired⁠](https://openai.com/careers/) more great people to help us achieve our [goals⁠](https://openai.com/index/openai-technical-goals/). Welcome, everyone!

## Full-time

-   **Dario Amodei**. [Dario⁠(opens in a new window)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dario-amodei-3934934) was one of the lead authors of [Deep Speech 2⁠(opens in a new window)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02595), a speech system which achieved near-human performance on many speech tasks. He is also a main co-author of “[Concrete Problems in AI Safety⁠(opens in a new window)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565)”, which highlights issues related to accidents in machine learning systems. Prior to OpenAI, he worked at Google Brain.
-   **Filip Wolski**. [Filip’s⁠(opens in a new window)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/filip-wolski-a7273728) recent background is in “practical” modeling, having spent the last few years working in the high-frequency trading space. In the past he enjoyed problem-solving in programming competitions, and won the [IOI⁠(opens in a new window)](http://stats.ioinformatics.org/people/768) and [ACM ICPC⁠(opens in a new window)](https://icpc.baylor.edu/community/history-icpc-2007).
-   **Jack Clark**. [Jack⁠(opens in a new window)](https://twitter.com/jackclarksf) has spent the past few years writing about artificial intelligence and distributed systems, most recently at Bloomberg and BusinessWeek. His articles have covered technologies like [memory networks⁠(opens in a new window)](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-06-09/the-future-of-computers-is-the-mind-of-a-toddler), [image generation⁠(opens in a new window)](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-02/computers-learn-how-to-paint-whatever-you-tell-them-to), and [reinforcement learning for robots⁠(opens in a new window)](http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-preschool-for-robots/), and issues like [diversity within AI⁠(opens in a new window)](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-23/artificial-intelligence-has-a-sea-of-dudes-problem). As our Strategy and Communications Director, he will help with community outreach, policy, communications, and strategy.
-   **Scott Gray**. [Scott⁠(opens in a new window)](https://twitter.com/scottgray76) was previously an engineer at [Nervana Systems⁠(opens in a new window)](https://www.nervanasys.com/author/scott-g/) where he focused on optimizing the performance of deep networks on GPUs. His [assembly-level optimizations⁠(opens in a new window)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.09308) for dense linear algebra and convolution remain the fastest available. When not [writing software⁠(opens in a new window)](https://github.com/scott-gray) he’s usually spending his time reading up on the latest research in neuroscience and related fields.
-   **Zain Shah**. [Zain⁠(opens in a new window)](https://twitter.com/zan2434) previously led deep learning efforts to build a collaborative human-machine intelligence system at [Clara Labs⁠(opens in a new window)](http://claralabs.com/). He’s also worked on [speech synthesis⁠(opens in a new window)](http://cepstral.com/) and [computational neuroscience⁠(opens in a new window)](http://cnbc.cmu.edu/), built [Mosaic⁠(opens in a new window)](http://mosaic.io/), and founded a mobile behavioral analytics [company⁠(opens in a new window)](http://watchsend.com/). He most recently built a [GIF search engine⁠(opens in a new window)](http://deepgif.tarzain.com/) using deep multimodal embeddings.

## Interns & visitors

We’re also pumped to be working with the following people for a more limited period of time:

-   **Catherine Olsson**. [Catherine⁠(opens in a new window)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherineolsson) built OpenAI Gym’s [REST API⁠(opens in a new window)](https://github.com/openai/gym-http-api), which has already attracted users in [Lua⁠(opens in a new window)](https://github.com/openai/gym-http-api/tree/master/binding-lua), [C++⁠(opens in a new window)](https://github.com/openai/gym-http-api/tree/master/binding-cpp), [Java⁠(opens in a new window)](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/gym-java-client), and [Rust⁠(opens in a new window)](https://github.com/openai/gym-http-api/tree/master/binding-rust). She graduated with a perfect GPA in CS and Brain & Cognitive Science from MIT, and has extensive research experience in [computational neuroscience⁠(opens in a new window)](http://f1000research.com/posters/1098032) and [psychology⁠(opens in a new window)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=TvdMDhwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=TvdMDhwAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC). Catherine has taught [programming and applied math⁠(opens in a new window)](http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~eero/math-tools14/) for six years, including outreach to women and underrepresented minorities.
-   **Harri Edwards**. [Harri⁠(opens in a new window)](https://github.com/harri-edwards) is a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, where he is researching models that can quickly adapt to new situations by [learning to represent datasets⁠(opens in a new window)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02185).
-   **Igor Mordatch**. [Igor⁠(opens in a new window)](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~igor.mordatch/) is interested in optimal control, machine learning, and their applications to robotics, biomechanics, and neuroscience. His PhD was in automated discovery and learning of complex movement [behaviors⁠(opens in a new window)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhr_jtQrhVA). He will join the faculty at [CMU⁠(opens in a new window)](http://www.cmu.edu/) in September 2017.
-   **Taco Cohen**. [Taco⁠(opens in a new window)](http://ta.co.nl/) is a PhD student working on applied and theoretical problems in representation learning. Most recently he invented group equivariant convolutional neural networks ([G-CNNs⁠(opens in a new window)](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v48/cohenc16.pdf)), a generalization of CNNs that improves the statistical efficiency of these models by exploiting symmetries.
-   **Tambet Matiisen**. [Tambet⁠(opens in a new window)](https://github.com/tambetm/) is a PhD student from University of Tartu, Estonia. He previously worked as a software engineer and founded his own [startup⁠(opens in a new window)](http://www.korteriyhistu.net/).
