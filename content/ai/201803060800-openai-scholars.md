You are eligible to apply if:

-   You are a member of an underrepresented group in science and engineering.
-   You have US work authorization and are located in a US timezone.
-   You understand this article on [calculus⁠(opens in a new window)](http://wiki.fast.ai/index.php/Calculus_for_Deep_Learning) and this article on [linear algebra⁠(opens in a new window)](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/matrix-algebra-linear-algebra-for-deep-learning-part-2). It’s fine if you have to brush up on these skills.
-   You are comfortable programming in Python (other languages are helpful, but you’ll spend the program writing in Python).

We’re open to all experience levels and backgrounds that meet the above criteria—it’s a common myth that you need a PhD to work in AI (many OpenAI employees don’t have one).

We’ll use these criteria for selection:

-   **Impact on you**. We want to understand why this grant and mentorship will help you achieve something you couldn’t otherwise.
-   **Self-motivation & communication**. We’re looking for people who will work hard through those three months, and who will inspire others (in the program and externally) to endeavor to learn deep learning as well.
-   **Technical skills**. The stronger your technical background, the more time you’ll spend focusing on the deep learning itself.
