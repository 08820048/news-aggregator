**Key Takeaways:**

Accenture and OpenAI are collaborating to help enterprises bring agentic AI capabilities into the core of their business and unlock new levels of growth.

As part of the agreement, Accenture will equip tens of thousands of its professionals with ChatGPT Enterprise so the firm can leverage it in consulting, operations and delivery work and help OpenAI scale its capabilities to enterprises. By embedding OpenAI technology and practices in Accenture’s consulting, operations and delivery work, Accenture will apply its learnings and experiences to helping clients scale their own adoption.

“By combining OpenAI’s breakthrough technologies with Accenture’s deep industry and functional expertise and global delivery capabilities, we will accelerate enterprise reinvention and business outcomes for our clients,” said Julie Sweet, Chair and CEO of Accenture. “We are also excited to help OpenAI become its own best credential.”

“Accenture plays an important role in helping companies adopt the technologies that define each new era, and we’re excited to partner with them to accelerate the AI transformation of the largest enterprises,” said Fidji Simo, CEO of Applications at OpenAI. “In addition, Accenture is now putting ChatGPT in the hands of tens of thousands of its professionals to help teams and clients move faster, strengthen their workflows, and generate real economic value.”

Through ChatGPT Enterprise, Accenture will have the largest number of professionals upskilled through [OpenAI Certifications](https://openai.com/index/expanding-economic-opportunity-with-ai/).

**Introducing the flagship AI client program**

To extend the impact of their collaboration to clients, OpenAI and Accenture are launching a new flagship AI program that combines OpenAI’s enterprise products with Accenture’s AI expertise and industry and function domain knowledge. The program will equip Accenture with the latest OpenAI implementation playbooks, industry use-cases, security and deployment insights, and hands-on expertise to help clients adopt AI in real business workflows. 

OpenAI and Accenture will collaborate on new enterprise solutions focused on key corporate functions, such as customer service, supply chain, finance, HR and other critical operations. For example, Accenture will use OpenAI’s AgentKit to help clients rapidly design, test and deploy custom AI agents that automate workflows, augment decision-making and accelerate reinvention. 

The goal of the program is to enable joint clients to adopt OpenAI’s agentic capabilities—innovative products, model advances and new workflows—faster and with deeper integration across their organizations.

It also builds on OpenAI’s work with many of the world’s largest and most established enterprises, including [Walmart⁠(opens in a new window)](https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2025/10/14/walmart-partners-with-openai-to-create-ai-first-shopping-experiences), [Salesforce⁠(opens in a new window)](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/10/14/openai-partnership-expansion-announcement/), [PayPal⁠(opens in a new window)](https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2025-10-28-OpenAI-and-PayPal-Team-Up-to-Power-Instant-Checkout-and-Agentic-Commerce-in-ChatGPT), [Intuit](https://openai.com/index/intuit-partnership/), [Target](https://openai.com/index/target-partnership/), [Thermo Fisher⁠(opens in a new window)](https://corporate.thermofisher.com/us/en/index/newsroom/Our-stories/Thermo-fisher-scientific-open-ai-collaboration.html), [BNY⁠(opens in a new window)](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bny-americas-oldest-bank-signs-multiyear-deal-with-openai-74987d1d?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqfSmObbQFCZOy4JBHnm1deYz6_WcJa0ETCyryA8EMyIAT7C9Nc1ZUZGLm2Oejw%3D&gaa_ts=69209805&gaa_sig=xrOe0zyM-gm4Sh4iPKjx6PFtsWjVmHwHOqdO2nCiVeINJqnTWfAUeX5z8MJYum0EeWnrHHwU0CBiVmHp_p_Y6g%3D%3D), [Morgan Stanley](https://openai.com/index/morgan-stanley/), [BBVA](https://openai.com/index/bbva/), and many more.
