OpenAIGaining deeper insight into how frontier models learn.We’re excited to share that OpenAI has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire neptune.ai, strengthening the tools and infrastructure that support progress in frontier research.Training advanced AI models is a creative, exploratory process that depends on seeing how a model evolves in real time. Neptune gives researchers a clear and dependable way to track experiments, monitor training, and understand complex model behavior as it happens.From its beginning, the Neptune team focused on supporting the hands-on, iterative work of model development. More recently, Neptune has worked closely with OpenAI to develop tools that enable researchers to compare thousands of runs, analyze metrics across layers, and surface issues. Neptune’s depth in this area will help us move faster, learn more from each experiment, and make better decisions throughout the training process.“Neptune has built a fast, precise system that allows researchers to analyze complex training workflows,” said Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI’s Chief Scientist. “We plan to iterate with them to integrate their tools deep into our training stack to expand our visibility into how models learn.”Piotr Niedźwiedź, founder and CEO of Neptune, said, “This is an exciting step for us. We’ve always believed that good tools help researchers do their best work. Joining OpenAI gives us the chance to bring that belief to a new scale.”We look forward to building the next chapter of training tools together.2025
