Today, we’re introducing shopping research, a new experience in ChatGPT that does the research for you to help you find the right products. Instead of sifting through dozens of sites, you can just describe what you’re looking for—“Find the quietest cordless stick vacuum for a small apartment,” “Help me choose between these three bikes,” or “I need a gift for my four year old niece who loves art”—and shopping research builds a thoughtful guide to help you decide. It asks smart clarifying questions, researches deeply across the internet, reviews quality sources, and builds on ChatGPT’s understanding of you from past conversations and your ChatGPT memory to deliver a personalized buyer’s guide in minutes.

Shopping research is starting to roll out today on mobile and web for logged-in ChatGPT users on Free, Go, Plus, and Pro plans. To help with holiday shopping, we’re making nearly unlimited usage available to all plans through the holidays.

## Finding the right products

Hundreds of millions of people use ChatGPT to find, understand, and compare products. They want help making sense of the options and deciding what fits their needs, budget, and preferences.

Shopping research is built for that deeper kind of decision-making. It turns product discovery into a conversation: asking smart questions to understand what you care about, pulling accurate, up-to-date details from high-quality sources, and bringing options back to you to refine the results. It performs especially well in detail-heavy categories like electronics, beauty, home and garden, kitchen and appliances, and sports and outdoor.

For simple shopping questions like checking a price or confirming a feature, a regular ChatGPT response is quick and all you need. But when you want depth—comparisons, constraints, tradeoffs—shopping research takes a few minutes to give you a more detailed, well-researched answer.

We’re also making shopping research available in ChatGPT Pulse, which is currently available to ChatGPT Pro users. When relevant, Pulse can suggest personalized buyer’s guides proactively based on your past conversations. For example, if you’ve been discussing e-bikes, a future Pulse card could suggest useful accessories for you.

## How to use it

Ask a shopping question and ChatGPT will suggest shopping research automatically. Tap it to begin, or you can also select ‘shopping research’ from the (+) menu.

When you start, ChatGPT opens a visual interface where you can chat and share feedback on product options to guide the research. You’ll explain what you’re looking for, and answer clarifying questions about things like your budget, who the item is for, or which features you care about. If you have memory turned on, the research can be tailored even further. For example, if ChatGPT knows that you’re into gaming, it can factor that in when helping you find a new laptop.

In the background it looks across the internet for up-to-date information like price, availability, reviews, specs, and images, and brings options back to you as it goes. You can guide the research along the way by interacting with suggested products and marking items as “Not interested” or “More like this.” This allows the research to adapt based on your real-time feedback.

After a few minutes, you’ll receive a personalized buyer’s guide with the top products, key differences, tradeoffs, and up-to-date information from reliable retailers. It’s a clear summary that normally would take a lot of comparing, reading, and checking on your own.

If you’d like to purchase an item, you can click through to the retailers site to do so. In the future, you’ll be able to purchase directly through ChatGPT for merchants who are part of [Instant Checkout⁠](https://openai.com/index/buy-it-in-chatgpt/) where available.

## How it works

Shopping research is powered by a version of GPT‑5 mini trained with reinforcement learning specifically for shopping tasks. We trained it to read trusted sites, cite reliable sources, and synthesize information across many sources to produce high-quality product research. We also designed it to be an interactive experience that could update and refine its research in real time—incorporating new constraints and adjusting to feedback on user product preferences—resulting in a response that feels both well-researched and personalized.

## Transparency and trust

Shopping research is designed to be transparent and helpful. Your chats are never shared with retailers. Results are organic and based on publicly available retail sites—reading product pages directly, citing sources, and avoiding low-quality or spammy sites. Merchants who want to ensure they are available to appear in shopping research results can follow the allowlisting process [here⁠(opens in a new window)](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11845367-chatgpt-agent-allowlisting).

## Limitations

While the model powering shopping research performs better relative to our other models on internal evaluations that measure its ability to accurately cite product details from the web, it is still not perfect. Shopping research might make mistakes about product details like price and availability, and we encourage you to visit the merchant site for the most accurate details.

## Just the start

Our goal is to help simplify finding the right products. ChatGPT will continue to get better at understanding your preferences, covering more categories and offering more intuitive ways to compare and discover products.
