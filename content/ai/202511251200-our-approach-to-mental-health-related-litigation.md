OpenAI

Cases involving mental health are tragic and complex, and they involve real people. We recognize that legal processes can feel removed from the people at the center of them, so we want to be clear about how we approach these situations.

Our goal is to handle mental health-related court cases with care, transparency, and respect:

-   We start with the facts and put genuine effort into understanding them.
-   We will respectfully make our case in a way that is cognizant of the complexity and nuances of situations involving real people and real lives.
-   We recognize that these cases inherently involve certain types of private information that require sensitivity when in a public setting like a court.   
-   And independent of any litigation, we’ll remain focused on improving our technology in line with our mission.

We have safeguards in place to help people, especially teens, when conversations turn sensitive. We continue improving ChatGPT’s training to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support. This work is deeply important and ongoing as we engage mental health experts, clinicians and advocacy groups to help guide our continued improvements in these areas.

## The Raine lawsuit

Our deepest sympathies are with the Raine family for their unimaginable loss. 

Because we are a defendant in this case, we are required to respond to the specific and serious allegations in the lawsuit. Our intention is to do so in keeping with the above principles. 

We think it’s important the court has the full picture so it can fully assess the claims that have been made. Our response to these allegations includes difficult facts about Adam’s mental health and life circumstances. The original complaint included selective portions of his chats that require more context, which we have provided in our response. We have limited the amount of sensitive evidence that we've publicly cited in this filing, and submitted the chat transcripts themselves to the court under seal.

More information about our safety work can be found here: 

  
Note: There are also new legal filings and we're reviewing them to carefully understand the details.

_While we had submitted chat transcripts to the Court under seal—for the reasons outlined above—the Raine family has elected to keep only a select portion of these under seal, and we will follow the Court's decision on what should be placed in the public record. We will continue to approach the legal process by keeping with the principles outlined here, including by only seeking information that’s relevant to the case and working to understand the facts in responding to the specific allegations that have been made._
