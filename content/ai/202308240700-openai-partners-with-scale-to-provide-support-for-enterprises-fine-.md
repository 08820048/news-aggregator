OpenAI and Scale are joining forces to help more companies benefit from fine-tuning our most advanced models.

Companies expect high performance, steerability, and customization when it comes to deploying AI in production. We recently [launched⁠](https://openai.com/index/gpt-3-5-turbo-fine-tuning-and-api-updates/) fine-tuning for GPT‑3.5 Turbo, and will bring fine-tuning to GPT‑4 this fall. With fine-tuning, companies can now securely customize our most advanced models on proprietary data, making our most powerful models even more useful. As always, data sent in and out of the fine-tuning API is owned by the customer and is not used by OpenAI, or any other organization, to train other models.

We’re working with Scale as a preferred partner to extend the benefits of our fine-tuning capability given their experience helping enterprises securely and effectively leverage data for AI. Building robust enterprise-grade functionality requires rigorous data enrichment and model evaluation. Scale customers can now fine-tune OpenAI models just as they would through OpenAI, while also benefiting from Scale’s enterprise AI expertise and Data Engine.

Scale has already demonstrated value for customers by fine-tuning GPT‑3.5 for Brex. Check out more details [here⁠(opens in a new window)](https://scale.com/blog/open-ai-scale-partnership-gpt-3-5-fine-tuning).
