**_December 19, 2025 clarification:_** _We are updating the blog to clarify the description of impacted users. The original blog stated that “API users” were impacted. It has been updated to add: “It also affected a limited number of ChatGPT users who submitted help center tickets or were logged into_ [_platform.openai.com_⁠(opens in a new window)](http://platform.openai.com/)_.” All impacted users were identified and notified at the same time as part of the original outreach to users. Aside from this clarification, nothing else about our understanding of the incident, including the type of information involved, has changed._ 

Transparency is important to us, so we want to inform you about a recent security incident at Mixpanel, a data analytics provider OpenAI used for web analytics on the frontend interface for our API product ([platform.openai.com⁠(opens in a new window)](https://platform.openai.com/)). 

The incident occurred within Mixpanel’s systems and involved limited analytics data related to some users of the API. It also affected a limited number of ChatGPT users who submitted help center tickets or were logged into platform.openai.com.

This was not a breach of OpenAI’s systems. No chat, API requests, API usage data, passwords, credentials, API keys, payment details, or government IDs were compromised or exposed.

**What happened**

On November 9, 2025, Mixpanel became aware of an attacker that gained unauthorized access to part of their systems and exported a dataset containing limited customer identifiable information and analytics information. Mixpanel notified OpenAI that they were investigating, and on November 25, 2025, they shared the affected dataset with us. 

**What this means for impacted users**

User profile information associated with the use of [platform.openai.com⁠(opens in a new window)](https://platform.openai.com/) may have been included in data exported from Mixpanel. The information that may have been affected was limited to:

-   Name that was provided to us on the account 
-   Email address associated with the account
-   Approximate coarse location based on user browser (city, state, country)
-   Operating system and browser used to access the account
-   Referring websites
-   Organization or User IDs associated with the account

**Our response**  

As part of our security investigation, we removed Mixpanel from our production services, reviewed the affected datasets, and are working closely with Mixpanel and other partners to fully understand the incident and its scope. We are in the process of notifying impacted organizations, admins, and users directly. While we have found no evidence of any effect on systems or data outside Mixpanel’s environment, we continue to monitor closely for any signs of misuse. 

Trust, security, and privacy are foundational to our products, our organization, and our mission. We are committed to transparency, and are notifying all impacted customers and users. We also hold our partners and vendors accountable for the highest bar for security and privacy of their services. After reviewing this incident, OpenAI has terminated its use of Mixpanel. 

Beyond Mixpanel, we are conducting additional and expanded security reviews across our vendor ecosystem and are elevating security requirements for all partners and vendors.

**What you should keep in mind**  

The information that may have been affected here could be used as part of phishing or social engineering attacks against you or your organization. 

Since names, email addresses, and OpenAI API metadata (e.g., user IDs)  were included, we encourage you to remain vigilant for credible-looking phishing attempts or spam. As a reminder:

-   Treat unexpected emails or messages with caution, especially if they include links or attachments.
-   Double-check that any message claiming to be from OpenAI is sent from an official OpenAI domain.
-   OpenAI does not request passwords, API keys, or verification codes through email, text, or chat.
-   Further protect your account by enabling [multi-factor authentication⁠(opens in a new window)](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7967234-enabling-or-disabling-multi-factor-authentication-mfa). 

The security and privacy of our products are paramount, and we remain resolute in protecting your information and communicating transparently when issues arise. Thank you for your continued trust in us.
