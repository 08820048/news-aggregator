The backbone of typical conferences consists of keynotes, plenaries, and panels, turning many of the attendees into passive spectators. At SOCML, the backbone of the event was about the interaction between participants, and they were able to form sessions, choose moderators, give impromptu lectures, and debug each other’s problems, without much administration. Everyone taught everyone else and everyone learned from everyone else.
