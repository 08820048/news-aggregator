OpenAI and Thrive Holdings are partnering to accelerate enterprise AI adoption.

Thrive Holdings invests in, acquires, and builds businesses that benefit from long-term, technology-driven transformation.

OpenAI and Thrive Holdings will work together to drive direct, scalable impact across core enterprise operations. The initial focus is accounting and IT services because these functions run high-volume, rules-driven, workflow-heavy processes where OpenAI's platform can drive immediate benefits.

OpenAI will embed research, product, and engineering teams inside Thrive Holdings’ companies to boost speed, accuracy, and cost efficiency while strengthening service quality. The work will establish a repeatable model that can expand across other industries.

“AI is redefining how enterprises are built and deliver value for customers,” said Brad Lightcap, COO of OpenAI. “This partnership with Thrive Holdings is about demonstrating what’s possible when frontier AI research and deployment are rapidly deployed across entire organizations to revolutionize how businesses work and engage with customers. We hope this partnership serves as a model for how businesses and industries around the world can deeply partner with OpenAI.”

“We are excited to extend our partnership with OpenAI to embed their frontier models, products, and services into sectors we believe have tremendous potential to benefit from technological innovation and adoption,” said Joshua Kushner, CEO and founder of Thrive Capital and Thrive Holdings. “Historically, technology transformed industries from the outside in. We believe this paradigm shift will happen from the inside out as domain experts and practitioners use AI as a native tool to reshape their fields. The businesses we acquire represent the right reward systems for this evolution, bringing together industry expertise and real-world data that can help improve models on specific tasks and capabilities.”
