We’ll be holding our final live event for OpenAI Five at 11:30am PT on April 13.

We’ll showcase aspects of OpenAI Five which we think illustrate how humans and AI will interact in the future. We believe that AI’s impact on the world will be driven by its competence, scalability, and ability to enhance what humans can do—and this event will use OpenAI Five to concretely demonstrate each of these. We hope Finals will help people better internalize AI progress and how it will affect the world.

We started working with Dota 2 because we expected it to be a good testbed for developing [general-purpose AI technologies⁠](https://openai.com/five/#overview). It has additionally turned out to be a great avenue for helping people experience modern AI—which we expect to become a high-stakes part of people’s lives in the future, starting with systems like self-driving cars.
