Social network Snapchat [announced](https://newsroom.snap.com/snapchat-launches-creator-subscriptions) today it’s launching creator subscriptions in alpha with select people in the U.S. starting on February 23. The company noted that users will be able to buy subscriptions to creators, including [Jeremiah Brown](https://www.snapchat.com/@findjeremiah?lang=en-GB), [Harry Jowsey](https://www.snapchat.com/@harryjowsey?lang=en-GB), and [Skai Jackson](https://www.snapchat.com/@skaijackk?lang=en-GB). This will allow users to unlock exclusive content while creating monetization opportunities for creators.

Creators can set their own monthly prices for subscription within the app, while Snap will recommend different tiers to them. The subscription will unlock subscriber-only content, priority replies to a creator’s public Stories, and ad-free consumption for that creator’s Stories.

Snap noted that this is a new way for creators to earn more money besides the existing programs.

“Expanding on existing monetization offerings like the Unified Monetization Program and the Snap Star Collab Studio, Creator Subscriptions introduce a premium layer of connection directly into how Snapchatters already engage with creators across Stories, Chat, and replies,” the company said in a blog [post](https://newsroom.snap.com/snapchat-launches-creator-subscriptions).

Snapchat reached 946 million daily active users, according to the company’s Q4 2025 results. The platform noted during its earnings that the number of U.S.-based users posting to Spotlight grew over 47% year-over-year. The company also spun out [hardware to a new entity called Specs last month](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/snap-gets-serious-about-specs-spins-ar-glasses-into-standalone-company/).

The company added that it plans to expand the program to Snap Stars in Canada, the U.K., and France in the coming weeks.

Rival company Meta also allows creators to offer subscriptions on platforms like [Instagram and Facebook](https://help.instagram.com/856296695055001), which gives users access to exclusive content and badges.
