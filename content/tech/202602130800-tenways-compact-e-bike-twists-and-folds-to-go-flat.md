Tenways just launched its new [CGO Compact](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tenways.com%2Fproducts%2Fcgo-compact) electric bike in Europe that’s designed to fit into tight spaces like car trunks, apartment hallways, and train compartments.

To achieve this, the CGO Compact is fitted with small 20-inch wheels, folding pedals, and a handlebar fitted with a twistable stem to create a slim, wall-hugging profile. The adjustable steering column and low-step through frame also make it suitable for a wide range of rider heights, so it could be a good shareable e-bike for families. And its MIK HD rear carrier system is good for hauling up to 27kg (almost 60 pounds) around town, with mounting points for additional accessories like a crate or child seat.

Tenways might not be a household name globally, but the Chinese e-bike company headquartered in the Netherlands is making a name for itself in Europe thanks to aggressive pricing, sleek designs, and over 1,500 shops and service centers. And while the CGO Compact’s €1,990 (about $2,365) price tag isn’t cheap, it’s well below the [€2,681 average](https://www.bike-eu.com/50105/e-bike-sales-in-europe-see-further-cooling-down) for European e-bikes.

The company does [sell e-bikes in the US](https://us.tenways.com/), but the CGO Compact is only for sale in Europe as of today. It features a 250W rear-hub motor connected to a Gates Carbon belt drive for maintenance-free propulsion. It promises a range of up to 100km from its 500Wh removable battery, but its single-speed drivetrain produces only 45Nm of torque so it’s best suited for relatively flat cities. If your commute does stray from asphalt then the suspension seat post should help absorb bumps. There’s also an integrated torque sensor to ensure the smooth delivery of pedal-assisted power, and Tektro hydraulic disc brakes should keep any sudden stops under control.

_A twist reduces width by nearly half._

Image: Tenways

The CGO Compact lives up to its name regarding size, but it’s not all that lightweight. Stripped down it weighs 19.8kg (almost 44 pounds), or 22.1kg (almost 49 pounds) with all the accessories you’ll want in wet urban environments. That makes it heavier than many full-sized e-bikes, even [from Tenways](https://us.tenways.com/pages/cgo600-pro), and less versatile than the excellent 20-inch [Brompton G foldable](https://www.theverge.com/reviews/626678/brompton-g-e-bike-most-versatile-multimodal-review) which also weighs less but costs more than twice as much.
