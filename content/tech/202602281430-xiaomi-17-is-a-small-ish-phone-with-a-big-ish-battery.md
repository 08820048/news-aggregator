summary: "The Xiaomi 17 and 17 Ultra are launching together, but there’s no sign of the Pro. Xiaomi has just given a global launch to two of its latest flagship phones, the Xiaomi 17 and 17 Ultra, along with a Leica-branded Leitzphone edition of the Ultra.

Xiaomi has just given a global launch to two of its latest flagship phones, the Xiaomi 17 and 17 Ultra, along with a [Leica-branded Leitzphone edition of the Ultra](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=vm_preview_make&post_id=886131). There’s no sign, however, of the 17 Pro, which launched in China with an additional display mounted next to the rear cameras.

The 17 and 17 Ultra will apparently be available soon in the UK, Europe, and select other markets. The 17 — pitched as a rival to the likes of the [iPhone 17](https://www.theverge.com/tech/779568/iphone-17-review-apple-best-features) and [Samsung Galaxy S26](https://www.theverge.com/tech/884239/samsung-galaxy-s26-plus-price-specs-gemini) — will cost £899 / €999 (about $1,200), while the larger and more capable Ultra starts from £1,299 / €1,499 ($1,750). The limited-edition Leitzphone will be substantially more expensive at £1,699 / €1,999 ($2,300), though it includes 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, along with a few extra accessories.

_I like the simple, sleek aesthetic of the phone._

_The 6.3-inch display isn’t tiny, but it does make the phone small by modern standards._

_All three of the phone’s rear cameras are 50-megapixel._

The 17 is an extremely capable small-ish flagship, with a 6.3-inch OLED display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, and large 6,330mAh silicon-carbon battery (though sadly smaller than the [7,000mAh version launched in China](https://www.theverge.com/news/785693/xiaomi-17-pro-max-china-launch-specs-price-second-screen)). I won’t be writing a full review of the 17, but did spend a week using it as my main phone, and found that the battery cruised past the full-day mark, though wasn’t quite enough for two full days of my typical usage. That’s far better battery life than you’d find in similarly sized phones from Apple, Samsung, or Google.

The cameras impress too, with 50-megapixel sensors behind each of the four lenses, selfie included. Pound for pound, you won’t find many better camera systems in any phone this size.

**1/10**

_I’ve been largely impressed by the Xiaomi 17’s cameras._

The Ultra, unsurprisingly, takes things to another level. It’s much larger, with a 6.9-inch display, and weighs a hefty 218g. Despite that, the 6,000mAh is actually smaller, though I found it delivered pretty similar longevity.

[![Photo of Xiaomi 17 and 17 Ultra on a table, closeup on the cameras](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/xiaomi-17-ultra-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400)](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/xiaomi-17-ultra-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0,0,100,100)

_The 17 Ultra is larger in just about every respect, but strangely has a smaller battery._

The enormous camera is, as ever for Xiaomi’s Ultra phones, the highlight. There are 50-megapixel sensors for each of the main, ultrawide, and selfie cameras, with a large 1-inch-type sensor behind the primary lens. The periscope telephoto is even more impressive: 200-megapixel resolution, a large 1/1.4-inch sensor, and continuous optical zoom from 3.2x to 4.3x, the equivalent of 75-100mm. Xiaomi isn’t the first to pull off a true zoom phone — [Sony’s Xperia 1 IV](https://www.theverge.com/23065641/sony-xperia-1-iv-announcement-hands-on-price-specs-zoom-screen) got there first in 2022 — but the telephoto camera here is far more capable than that phone’s, with natural bokeh and impressive performance even in low light.

_This is the Leica-branded Leitzphone version of the 17 Ultra._

The camera capabilities are supported by Xiaomi’s ongoing photography partner Leica, but it’s the pair’s Leitzphone that really emphasizes that. Slightly redesigned from the 17 Ultra Leica Edition that was [released in China last December](https://www.theverge.com/news/850599/xiaomi-17-ultra-leica-edition-zoom-ring), this includes Leica branding across the hardware and software, a range of Leica filters and shooting styles, and a rotatable rear camera ring that can be used to control the zoom. It’s the first Leica Leitzphone produced by Xiaomi — after a trio of Japan-only Sharp models — and comes with additional branded accessories, including a case with a lens cap and a microfiber cleaning cloth.

Xiaomi has plenty of other announcements alongside the 17 series phones at MWC this year, including a [super-slim magnetic power bank](https://www.theverge.com/tech/884330/xiaomi-ultra-thin-magnetic-magsafe-power-bank-5000-qi2), the [Pad 8 and Pad 8 Pro tablets](https://www.theverge.com/tech/886911/xiaomi-has-two-new-tablets-too), and a [smart tag](https://www.theverge.com/tech/884567/xiaomi-tag-tracker-apple-find-my-google-hub-bluetooth) that supports both Google and Apple’s tech-tracking networks.
