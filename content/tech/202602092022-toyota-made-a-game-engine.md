summary: "A screenshot of a demo from the Fluorite engine. Using a game engine in a \"digital cockpit\" can be useful for things like step-by-step 3D tutorials about a car, mapping the environment around your car, and offering more natural controls, Jamie Kerber, the lead engineer of a new game engine developed by Toyota Connected North America, said in a recent presentation at the FOSDEM 2026 conference. That's why the company is showing off the solution it's developed, called Fluorite, that could work in its vehicles, as reported on by Eurogamer and Game*Spark.

That’s why the company is showing off the solution it’s developed, called Fluorite, that could work in its vehicles, as reported on by Eurogamer and Game*Spark.Epic Games has made a big push for car companies to use Unreal Engine to power those in-car interfaces and visualize them for design and marketing, and so has Unity. As a result, automakers are now regularly looking to hire game designers who have experience using the tools. But limitations like high licensing fees and being resource-heavy on hardware that is sometimes years behind state-of-the-art can be issues for car companies.Fluorite, on the other hand, is the “first console-grade game engine” that’s “fully integrated with” the Flutter SDK, according to the Fluorite website, and it has “great performance” on lower-end and embedded hardware while also offering “hardware-accelerated visuals comparable to those found on gaming consoles.”Fluorite still seems quite early in development, however. The team is looking for collaborations with engineering teams to commit development resources to the project and establish a common roadmap for the engine, according to the presentation.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jay PetersThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)
