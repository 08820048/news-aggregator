When you buy a new Nintendo device, there are a few things you can expect: namely, some excellent _Super Mario_, _Pokémon_, and _Legend of Zelda_ games, and maybe a great _Animal Crossing_, _Mario Kart_, or _Smash Bros_. The question mark has always been the _other_ stuff. But with the Switch 2, it doesn’t seem like that will be a problem; its upcoming lineup already seems surprisingly strong.

There are a few reasons for this optimistic outlook. One is a more reliable output from the company’s seemingly smaller releases, like this week’s launch of _Mario Tennis Fever_. As with the rest of the series, _Fever_ is to real tennis what _Mario Kart_ is to real racing. Which is to say, it’s ridiculous, adding in all kinds of wacky power-ups and characters that turn it into a chaotic mess that is perfect for playing with friends.

_Fever_ is a robust package. In addition to the basic multiplayer tournaments, there’s a mode where you ascend a tower by taking on challenges, a motion control option that harkens back to the days of _Wii Sports_, and a single-player mode where Mario has to relearn all of his tennis skills after being turned into a baby.

This all makes _Fever_ the exact kind of game that’s crucial for a platform like the Switch 2: It helps fill in the gaps between bigger releases. The current Switch 2 lineup for 2026 is made up of a similar tier of games, with titles including the [_Pokémon_ spinoff _Pokopia_](https://www.theverge.com/games/819926/pokopia-extended-trailer-professor-tangrowth), the cross-generation [life sim _Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream_](https://www.theverge.com/games/870062/its-animal-crossing-for-sickos), the adorable platformer [_Yoshi and the Mysterious Book_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YluJneE1bMo)_,_ and the [strategy game _Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave_](https://www.theverge.com/news/777187/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave-annoucement-trailer).

New to this is Switch games being given significant upgrades for Nintendo’s newest hardware. [The _Animal Crossing: New Horizons_ community got a reinvigorating boost with the surprise 3.0 update for the game earlier this year](https://www.theverge.com/games/863747/animal-crossing-new-horizons-update-3-0-switch-2-quality-of-life), and _Super Mario Bros. Wonder_ is aiming to do something similar with [an upgrade in March](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVB3hZoOF0A).

As Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said during the company’s [most recent earnings results](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260204e.pdf), these kinds of updates are particularly important now during the transitional period between the original Switch and its successor. “It is necessary to regularly release new titles to increase the installed base of new hardware,” he explained. “In addition, we believe it is very important to maintain touchpoints with consumers who are active on our gaming systems as the transition from Nintendo Switch to Nintendo Switch 2 unfolds over the next few years.”

The other key part to the company’s strategy is third-party support, which has always been an inconsistent part of the Nintendo experience. Despite some games that launched much later compared to other platforms, the original Switch did fairly well on that front, likely due to its overwhelming popularity, and the Switch 2 is headed in a similarly positive direction. Last week’s Nintendo Direct was filled with some of the [biggest franchises in video games](https://www.theverge.com/games/874282/nintendo-direct-february-2026-fallout-ff7): _Fallout_, _Final Fantasy_, _Elder Scrolls_, and _Resident Evil_, to name a few. Some of those are older games, of course — [I originally reviewed _Fallout 4_ more than a decade ago](https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/9/9693246/fallout-4-review-ps4-xbox-pc) — but _Resident Evil Requiem_ will be launching on the Switch 2 at the same time as the PS5, Xbox, and PC, which is a good sign.

We know that there will be big Nintendo games coming eventually. The Switch 2’s first year already included the likes of [_Mario Kart World_](https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2), [_Donkey Kong Bananza_](https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2), and [_Metroid Prime 4: Beyond_](https://www.theverge.com/games/835325/metroid-prime-4-review-nintendo-switch). With the [annual](https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/618678/pokemon-presents-2025-all-the-biggest-news-and-trailers) Pokémon Day happening later this month, it seems possible that the next mainline _Pokémon_ game will be revealed soon as well. Obviously Mario and Zelda will come at some point; it’s been almost 10 years since [_Super Mario Odyssey_](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch), the last all-new 3D entry in the series, while [_Tears of the Kingdom_](https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch) launched three years ago.

In the past, that lack of clarity around the big franchises would be a cause for concern. But in the Switch 2 era, there’s enough other stuff to play, and that stuff is good enough, that Nintendo isn’t as beholden to the success of those blockbusters. You may buy a Nintendo console for _Mario_ and _Zelda_, but games like _Mario Tennis Fever_ are what make them platforms worth investing in.
