is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.

Sharge has made a name for itself amongst the tech-obsessed with [chargers](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/7/24065111/sharge-retro67-usbc-charger-mac) and [power banks](https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/26/24207136/i-tried-the-sharge-pouch-a-power-bank-charger-cable-and-fashion-accessory-in-one) featuring [eye-catching designs](https://www.theverge.com/news/804531/sharge-icemag-3-magsafe-qi-2-2-sony-cybershot) and [extra functionality](https://www.theverge.com/news/675072/sharge-usb-c-wall-charger-pixelated-led-display). [Power bank feature creep](https://www.theverge.com/tech/856225/power-banks-are-the-latest-victims-of-feature-creep) is more often than not a bad thing, but Sharge is unabashedly leaning into the trend with its new Shargeek 300. We first went [hands on with it over a year ago at CES 2025](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336910/if-you-can-output-300w-from-a-power-bank-why-not-make-it-an-rgb-light-show-too), but the power bank is finally available for preorder.

The earliest backers of [Sharge’s latest Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/edc-power-bank/shargeek300?) can preorder the power bank for $149, while its full price is expected to be closer to $199 once delivery starts as early as May 2026. Inside the Shargeek 300 is a 24,000 mAh battery that can be fully recharged in 75 minutes using a 140W charger.

[![A person holds the Shargeek 300 power bank in their left hand.](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/shargeek300_2.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400)](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/shargeek300_2.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0,0,100,100)

As the name implies, the Shargeek 300’s total output is 300W which is shared across two USB-C ports, a USB-A port, and a barrel-style DC port. Both USB-C ports can output up to 140W letting you simultaneously charge two power-hungry laptops while a third device pulls 20W from the USB-A port. The output of the DC port can be adjusted from as little as 25W up to 140W.

The Shargeek 300 features a lightweight aluminum alloy frame wrapped in an aluminum shell that helps to dissipate heat. There’s also two cutaway sections, protected by transparent plastic windows, revealing some of the power bank’s electronics and a 1.9-inch screen on one side, and the batteries on the other. You can use the screen to monitor the battery’s charge level, power output, temperature, and adjust the DC output voltage. The exposed interior is also illuminated with RGB LEDs whose color, brightness, and function can be customized using the display.
