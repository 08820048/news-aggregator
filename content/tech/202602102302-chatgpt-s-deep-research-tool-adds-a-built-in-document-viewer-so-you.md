OpenAI is updating ChatGPT’s deep research tool [with a full-screen viewer](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes) that you can use to scroll through and navigate to specific areas of its AI-generated reports. As shown in a [video shared by OpenAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gCqVb2lBwk), the built-in viewer allows you to open ChatGPT’s reports in a window separate from your chat, while showing a table of contents on the left side of the screen, and a list of sources on the right.

Deep research, which [OpenAI first launched last year](https://www.theverge.com/news/604902/chagpt-deep-research-ai-agent), has ChatGPT scour the web to compile an in-depth report about the topic of your choosing. With this most recent update, you’ll be able to ask ChatGPT to focus on specific websites and connected apps for its research.

You can also track ChatGPT’s progress in real-time, as well as edit the scope of its research or add new sources while the chatbot generates a report. Once the report is complete, you can download the file from the new viewer in several formats, including Markdown, Word, and PDF.

OpenAI says these new features are headed to Plus and Pro users starting today, while subscribers to its [new ChatGPT Go tier](https://www.theverge.com/news/863466/openai-chatgpt-go-global-release) and people who use the app for free will see the deep research update in the “coming days.”
