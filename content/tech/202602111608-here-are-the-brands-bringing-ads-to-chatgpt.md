OpenAI officially launched [its advertising pilot](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/876029/openai-testing-ads-in-chatgpt) in ChatGPT, leaving us with a better idea of the kinds of products we might see stuffed beneath our conversations with the AI chatbot. Several companies have announced plans to show ads inside ChatGPT — placements that [will reportedly cost them a pretty penny](https://www.theverge.com/news/867898/openai-chatgpt-ad-pricing) — ranging from major retailers like Target to automakers like Ford and Mazda.

You’ll only see ads in ChatGPT if you’re a free user or [subscribed to its cheaper $8 / month Go plan](https://www.theverge.com/news/863466/openai-chatgpt-go-global-release). OpenAI [has said it will “clearly” label](https://www.theverge.com/news/863428/openai-chatgpt-shopping-ads-test) the ads and that they won’t influence ChatGPT’s response. Here are all the brands that we know are partnering with OpenAI so far.

## Target

Target [says in an announcement](https://corporate.target.com/press/fact-sheet/2026/02/conversational-ai-advertising) that it will use ads in ChatGPT to help users “discover products, deals and inspiration that meet what they’re seeking at that moment.” It notes that ads will appear based on keywords that appear in a user’s ChatGPT prompt. As an example, Target says someone using ChatGPT to look for “countertop cooking appliances that make everyday meals more convenient” might see an ad for an air fryer from Target.

## Adobe

Adobe is planning to show ads for its AI-powered document editor, Acrobat Studio, and its AI video and image generator, Adobe Firefly, in ChatGPT. It’s [positioning the partnership](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2026/02/09/adobe-partners-openai-test-ads-chatgpt) as a way to “better understand how ads can provide helpful, relevant experiences” as it ramps up its own platform designed to help advertisers show up in AI search results.

## Williams-Sonoma

You might see ads for Williams-Sonoma’s range of housewares, kitchenware, furniture, and other products, too. The [company says](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260211993758/en/WILLIAMS-SONOMA-INC.-PARTNERS-WITH-OPENAI-TO-TEST-ADS-IN-CHATGPT) it’s going to explore how ads in ChatGPT will help “surface relevant, high-quality products” at “decision-making moments.”

## Audible

It looks like ChatGPT’s ads won’t be limited to tangible products, either, as the Amazon-owned Audible [plans to work with OpenAI](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/audible_wpp-media-joins-openai-ads-pilot-to-test-activity-7427063868754989056-oOT-?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACjw9ZoBmrKRTdz4d71rpEsIL97f1EVRybM) to “reach new audiobook listeners” through ChatGPT. It’s not clear whether Audible will only show ads for its subscription or if it will showcase specific audiobooks when someone asks ChatGPT for recommendations.

## Ford, Mazda, Mrs. Myers, and more

The [advertising agency WPP Media](https://www.wppmedia.com/news/opeai-ads-pilot) is working with Ford, Mazda, the cleaning company Mrs. Myers, and the luxury Swiss watch company Audemars Piguet to launch ads in ChatGPT as well. (Its other clients include Audible and Adobe, too). Meanwhile, other agencies, including Dentsu and Omnicom, have announced that they’re going to bring their clients’ ads to ChatGPT as well, though they don’t specify which brands are involved.

Instead, [Dentsu notes](https://www.dentsu.com/us/en/media-and-investors/dentsu-joins-openai-ad-pilot-program-as-an-early-test-partner) that it has “several clients” participating in OpenAI’s test across grocery, hospitality, retail, software, travel, and the [consumer packaged goods](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cpg.asp) (CPG) industries, which could include items like food and beverages, cosmetics, or cleaning products. [Omnicom lists](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/412663/openai-chatgpt-starts-testing-ads-with-adobe-wpp.html) companies specializing in apparel, automotive, beauty, CPG, technology, telecommunications, hospitality, retail, and fast-food as participants in OpenAI’s test.
