Jack Dorsey has long been an open admirer of Elon Musk. Now, it seems, he may have been taking notes.

On Thursday, Dorsey [announced](https://x.com/jack/status/2027129697092731343) that Block, the payments company he founded that operates Square, Cash App, and Tidal, is cutting more than 4,000 employees, nearly [half](https://www.wsj.com/business/jack-dorseys-block-to-lay-off-4-000-employees-in-ai-remake-28f0d869) its global workforce, taking it from over 10,000 workers down to just under 6,000. Investors responded enthusiastically, sending the stock up more than 24% in after-hours trading.

It isn’t the first time a major tech company has done something of the sort. In November 2022, Musk slashed roughly 50% of Twitter’s staff in a single stroke after taking the company private, a move that rattled many in Silicon Valley and rewrote the unofficial rules for how far a CEO could go in one shot.

Dorsey was in an unusual position to watch it unfold. He’d rolled his roughly 2.4% ownership stake in Twitter into Musk’s takeover rather than taking a cash payout, making him one of the largest outside investors in what became X.

The two men have had one of tech’s stranger relationships, with warm words giving way to public shots, then back again. Dorsey championed Musk’s Twitter acquisition, then said Musk “should have walked away.” He helped launch Bluesky, the decentralized Twitter alternative, then quit its board and called X “freedom technology.” Both are also vocal Bitcoin advocates — Block and Tesla each carry the cryptocurrency on their balance sheets.

Dorsey framed Thursday’s cuts as a proactive, even empathetic, choice, and not a financial emergency. (The 4,000 people losing their jobs may see it differently.) “Repeated rounds of cuts are destructive to morale, to focus, and to the trust that customers and shareholders place in our ability to lead,” he wrote on X. He predicted that within a year, most companies will arrive at the same place. “I’d rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively,” he said.

The cuts are being driven, at least officially, by AI. Block CFO Amrita Ahuja said the cuts will position the company to “move faster with smaller, highly talented teams using AI to automate more work.”

As for severance, Dorsey told U.S. employees who are being cut that they will receive “your salary for 20 weeks + 1 week per year of tenure, equity vested through the end of \[M\]ay, 6 months of health care, your corporate devices, and $5,000 to put toward whatever you need to help you in this transition.” Employees outside the U.S. will receive “similar support” dependent on their countries’ policies, he added.

Salesforce and Amazon are among a growing list of other companies that have made [enormous](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/02/salesforce-ceo-confirms-4000-layoffs-because-i-need-less-heads-with-ai.html) staffing [cuts](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/amazon-layoffs-anti-bureaucracy-ai.html) citing the increased gains they are seeing from AI, though a Forrester Research report last month [cast some doubt](https://www.forrester.com/press-newsroom/forrester-impact-ai-jobs-forecast/) on how real those gains are versus the likelihood that many layoffs are financially driven.
