OpenAI has partnered with India’s Tata Group to secure 100 megawatts of AI-ready data center capacity in the country, with plans to scale to 1 gigawatt. The move is part of a broader push to deepen the company’s enterprise and infrastructure footprint in one of its fastest-growing markets.

OpenAI [announced](https://openai.com/openai-for-india/) on Thursday that the partnership with the Tata Group is part of its [Stargate project](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/17/openais-stargate-project-sets-its-sights-on-international-expansion/), which aims to build AI-ready infrastructure and expand enterprise adoption globally. OpenAI will become the first customer of Tata Consultancy Services’ HyperVault data center business, beginning with 100 megawatts of capacity. The deal also includes deploying ChatGPT Enterprise across Tata’s workforce and standardizing AI-native software development through OpenAI’s tools.

The partnership, which falls under the “OpenAI for India” initiative, highlights the company’s expanding footprint in the country, which according to recent estimates from CEO Sam Altman has [more than 100 million weekly ChatGPT users](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/india-has-100m-weekly-active-chatgpt-users-sam-altman-says/) spanning students, teachers, developers, and entrepreneurs. The scale of adoption has positioned India as one of OpenAI’s most important growth markets as it deepens enterprise and infrastructure investments in the country.

The local data center capacity will allow OpenAI to run its most advanced models within India, reducing latency for users while meeting data residency, security, and compliance requirements for regulated sectors and government workloads. Hosting compute domestically is critical for enterprises that handle sensitive data and operate under data localization and digital infrastructure rules. These circumstances could widen OpenAI’s access to enterprise customers that require in-country processing.

An initial 100 megawatts of capacity represents a substantial commitment in the context of AI infrastructure, where large-scale model training and inference require power-hungry clusters of graphics processing units, or GPUs. Scaling to 1 gigawatt over time would place the Tata facility among the largest AI-focused data center deployments globally, underlining the scale of OpenAI’s long-term ambitions in India.

Beyond infrastructure, OpenAI and Tata Group will pursue a strategic enterprise collaboration aimed at accelerating AI adoption across Tata’s businesses. The conglomerate plans to roll out ChatGPT Enterprise to its workforce over the coming years, beginning with hundreds of thousands of employees at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), in what would rank among the largest enterprise AI deployments globally. TCS also intends to use OpenAI’s Codex tools to standardize AI-native software development across its engineering teams.

N Chandrasekaran, chairman of Tata Sons, said OpenAI’s partnership would help build “state-of-the-art AI infrastructure in India” while supporting efforts to skill the country’s workforce for the AI era.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, including whether OpenAI is making a capital investment in HyperVault or leasing capacity.

In November 2025, TCS [secured backing from private equity firm TPG](https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/20/indias-tcs-gets-tpg-to-fund-half-of-2b-ai-data-center-project/) to develop AI-ready infrastructure in India under its HyperVault data center business. The platform is backed by about ₹180 billion (about $2 billion) in planned investment and is designed to support large-scale compute workloads for hyperscalers and enterprise customers.

OpenAI will also expand its certification programs in India, with TCS becoming the first participating organization outside the United States. The certifications are designed to help professionals build practical AI skills across roles and industries, the company said. The move follows OpenAI’s [recent partnerships with leading Indian institutions](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/18/openai-pushes-into-higher-education-as-india-seeks-to-scale-ai-skills/) in engineering, medicine, and design.

OpenAI plans to open new offices in Mumbai and Bengaluru later this year, adding to its [existing presence in New Delhi](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/openai-announces-new-delhi-office-as-it-expands-footprint-in-india/) as it deepens operations in the country. The expansion is expected to support enterprise partnerships, developer engagement, and local regulatory coordination as the company scales its footprint in India.

The announcement comes as India hosts its [AI Impact Summit](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/16/all-the-important-news-from-the-ongoing-india-ai-summit/) in New Delhi, where global AI leaders, including Sam Altman, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Google CEO Sundar Pichai are participating alongside Indian startups and enterprises showcasing AI applications across sectors such as finance, healthcare, and education.

OpenAI has been expanding its presence in India through [partnerships with companies including Pine Labs](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/18/openai-deepens-india-push-with-pine-labs-fintech-partnership/), JioHotstar, Eternal, Cars24, HCLTech, PhonePe, CRED, and MakeMyTrip, as it seeks to embed its models across consumer platforms, enterprise systems and digital payments infrastructure in one of the world’s largest internet markets.

Together, the data center build-out, enterprise deployments, and expanding partner ecosystem signal OpenAI’s most comprehensive push yet to anchor advanced AI infrastructure and applications in India.
