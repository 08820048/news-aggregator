See, you can do it.

Toyota’s small electric SUV is much-revised, much more efficient, and much better.

The world’s largest automaker has had [a somewhat difficult relationship](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/toyota-bet-wrong-on-evs-so-now-its-lobbying-to-slow-the-transition/) with battery-electric vehicles. Toyota was an early pioneer of hybrid powertrains, and it remains a fan today, often saying that given limited battery supply, it makes sense to build more hybrids than fewer EVs. Its first full BEV had a rocky start, suffering a recall due to improperly attached wheels just as the cars were hitting showrooms. [Reviews for the awkwardly named bZ4x were mixed](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/08/the-2023-toyota-bz4x-review-not-as-bad-as-the-horror-stories-have-it/); the car did little to stand out among the competition.

Toyota didn’t get to be the world’s largest automaker by being completely blind to feedback, and last year, it gave its EV platform (called e-TNGA and shared with Lexus and Subaru) a bit of a spiff-up. To start, it simplified the name—the small electric SUV is now just called the bZ. It uses a new 74.7 kWh battery pack, available with either front- or all-wheel-drive powertrains that now use silicon carbide power electronics. And for the North American market, instead of a CCS1 port just behind the front passenger wheel, you’ll now see a Tesla-style NACS socket.

Our test bZ was the $37,900 XLE FWD Plus, which has the most range of any bZ at 314 miles (505 km), according to the EPA test cycle. When you realize that the pre-facelift version managed just 252 miles (405 km) with 71.4 kWh onboard, the scale of the improvement becomes clear.

Standard equipment is generous, even in XLE trim. Jonathan Gitlin

Our loan immediately followed [a week with the bZ’s more powerful, more expensive Lexus relative](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/2026-lexus-rz-550e-review-likable-but-it-needs-improvement/). While I might have liked that Lexus interior and some of its mod cons like ventilated seats, the Toyota is a much better EV despite having fewer frills. With 221 hp (165 kW) going to the front tires and 4,156 lbs (1,885 kg) to move, the XLE FWD Plus is not speedy. In normal mode, 0–60 mph (97 km/h) takes 8 seconds, although there’s still enough torque in this setting to chirp the low rolling resistance tires.

## A great city appliance

In Eco, things get even more sluggish at low speeds. And I don’t actually think that’s a bad thing, particularly when you’re driving in the city and there are 20 mph speed limits everywhere. More than 4 miles/kWh (15.5 kWh/100 km) should be effortless to achieve; my last drive averaged 5.7 miles/kWh (10.9 kWh/100 km) without trying particularly hard.

In fact, the bZ was efficient enough that I didn’t have time to deplete its battery enough to test the DC fast charging, which should take 30 minutes to charge from 10 to 80 percent at a maximum rate of 150 kW. As with the Lexus, the charge port’s location means you’ll need to park very close to a V3 Tesla Supercharger if you decide to use one. Newer V4 Superchargers have longer cables, as do the CCS1 chargers and dual-port chargers deployed by networks like Electrify America and IONNA. (All bZs come with adapters that let you charge at CCS1 or J1772 chargers.)

Yes, that says 5.7 miles/kWh. Jonathan Gitlin

On the road, you can toggle through four levels of the regenerative braking that occurs when you lift your foot off the accelerator, though there’s no true one-pedal driving mode. The bZ will only slow to 3–4 mph (5–6.5 km/h), at which point you’ll need to use the friction brakes via the brake pedal to come to a complete stop. (Using the brake pedal will also slow the car with regenerative braking until around 0.3 G, at which point the friction brakes take over.)

It’s not a particularly engaging car to drive, but it is a rather mellow experience—not a bad thing when driving in traffic. You have a good view out the front from the driver’s seat, but the minimalist main instrument display can be too easily blocked by the rim of the steering wheel. The multifunction controls on the steering wheel are all proper buttons, as are enough controls [to satisfy European and Australian crash testers](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/buttons-in-cars-australian-crash-testers-are-latest-to-require-them/), but you’ll still need to poke the touchscreen for some of the climate settings.

The 14-inch infotainment system is standard across the entire bZ range, as are the dual wireless charging pads for your phones and four USB-C ports. There’s also a good amount of interior storage, and the rear door openings are generous. Props to the seat heaters as well, which warmed up very quickly.

There’s a good amount of storage cubbies and nooks. Jonathan Gitlin

Between the much-improved efficiency and the ease with which the bZ slots into daily life, plus the sub-$40,000 starting price, there’s a lot to like about this EV. I feel comfortable recommending it to people looking for a solid electric driving appliance who don’t want to deal with Hyundai or Kia dealers (or lose out on CarPlay by buying a Chevrolet). An even cheaper FWD model saves $3,000 thanks to a smaller battery, but it loses 78 miles (125 km) in the process. [A bZ Woodland](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/looks-a-lot-like-an-electric-station-wagon-the-2026-toyota-bz-woodland/) variant is available for those wanting something a little more rugged without going for the [Subaru-badged](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/2026-subaru-uncharted-first-drive-fwd-might-be-the-biggest-selling-point/) e-TNGA EVs.

One thing’s for sure: The competition for EVs under $40,000 is getting interesting.
