A Vermont-based startup has announced a new upgrade kit that adds a remotely triggered backup camera cleaner to your car. The [Lens Lizard system](https://lenslizard.com/) might seem like an unnecessary luxury to some, but if you deal with ice and snow obscuring your backup camera every winter, or live somewhere remote with dirt roads mucking up your ride, the upgrade will save you from having to frequently clean the camera yourself.

Its creators are making the Lens Lizard [available through a Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lenslizard/lens-lizard-a-remote-controlled-backup-camera-cleaner) and those who back the crowdfunding campaign can preorder a kit discounted to $99. Full retail pricing is expected to be closer to $149 while shipping will start in April 2026.

The NHTSA has mandated backup cameras on new vehicles since 2018, but cleaning systems aren’t common and can be costly. You can find them on vehicles from Subaru, Toyota, and VW, but the feature is frequently part of more expensive trim packages. The Lens Lizard is an aftermarket upgrade that’s compatible with “most North American vehicles” as long as the backup camera is located above the rear license plate.

One of the reasons the Lens Lizard is limited to North American vehicles is because the hardware is sized and shaped to be a self-contained module that’s installed behind your license plate using the existing screw holes and minimal tools. It features a refillable reservoir for wiper fluid that’s blasted at a backup camera using an adjustable high-pressure pump.

The reservoir and removable rechargeable battery powering the pump will supposedly last for four to six months depending on how frequently you’re cleaning the lens. To further simplify installation, the Lens Lizard doesn’t connect to your vehicle’s electrical system. You can instead remotely trigger it, even while driving, using an included wireless Bluetooth remote.
