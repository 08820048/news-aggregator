[Suno](https://suno.com/home) co-founder and CEO Mikey Shulman [shared on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7432540569316364289/?originTrackingId=56hl0akIaJTAuh08jvFDOw%3D%3D) that the AI music generator has amassed 2 million paid subscribers and $300 million in annual recurring revenue.

Just three months ago, Suno announced a [$250 million funding round](https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/legally-embattled-ai-music-startup-suno-raises-at-2-45b-valuation-on-200m-revenue/) that valued the company at $2.45 billion. At the time, Suno told The Wall Street Journal that annual revenue had hit $200 million — that would indicate that the company has had some major growth in a short time frame.

Suno lets users create music using natural language prompts, making it possible for people with little experience to generate audio with little effort. This has sparked concern from musicians and record labels, who have sued Suno for copyright infringement, since its AI model was likely trained on existing recorded music. But Warner Music Group recently [settled its lawsuit](https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/25/warner-music-signs-deal-with-ai-music-startup-suno-settles-lawsuit/) and instead reached a deal that allows Suno to launch models that use licensed music from its catalog.

Suno has generated synthetic music that sounds real enough to top charts on Spotify and Billboard. Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her poetry into the viral R&B song “[How Was I Supposed to Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opuDZYJuAz0)” and signed a record deal with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth [$3 million](https://www.ebony.com/xania-monet-ai-artist-record-deal/).

Still, many musicians have [spoken out](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/02/nicki-minaj-billie-eilish-katy-perry-and-other-musicians-sign-letter-against-irresponsible-ai/) against the use of AI in music, including Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, Katy Perry, and more.
