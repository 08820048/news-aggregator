In Brief Posted: 2:04 PM PST · February 6, 2026 Image Credits:Anthropic On Thursday, WordPress launched a new Claude connector, enabling site owners to share back-end data with Anthropic’s chatbot system. Users can control what specific data they want to share, and access can also be revoked if and when the user chooses. Notably, Claude is given read-only access, meaning it won’t be able to alter anything within a user’s CMS. However, last year WP claimed that it would eventually deliver “write” access to the MCP integration, presumably allowing users to conduct editorial tasks directly from a connected chatbot of their choosing. At any rate, after Claude is linked to an account, users can ask the chatbot all sorts of questions about the site data that it’s been given access to — from summarizing the site’s monthly web traffic to conducting analysis of which posts have low user engagement. WordPress has also provided a list of template prompts for the chatbot — stuff like “Show me pending comments on my blog” or “Which of my sites gets the most traffic?” or “Show me which posts are generating the most discussion.” Others functions include comment management (“Show me pending comments on my blog”) and plug-in management (“What plug-ins are installed on my main site?”).
