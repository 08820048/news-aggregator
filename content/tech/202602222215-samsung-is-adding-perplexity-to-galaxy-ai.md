In addition to summoning [Bixby](https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-introduces-the-new-bixby-in-one-ui-8-5) or [Gemini](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349416/google-gemini-virtual-assistant-samsung-siri-alexa), Galaxy S26 users will be able to call on Perplexity by saying “[hey, Plex](https://news.samsung.com/global/galaxy-ai-expands-multi-agent-ecosystem-to-give-users-more-choice-and-flexibility).” The integration of Perplexity into Galaxy AI is just one element of the company’s embrace of a “multi-agent ecosystem.”

Often, people will use different AI agents for different tasks, depending on where their strengths lie. So Samsung is opening up the ability to integrate different agents into the OS. Hey, Plex isn’t just some transparent version of the app baked into a Galaxy phone to quickly get answers to questions. Perplexity will have access to Samsung Notes, Clock, Gallery, Reminder, and Calendar, as well as select third-party apps, though which ones specifically Samsung didn’t say.

Samsung seems to believe that people will increasingly use AI to interact with their phones. But, as we’ve learned, people can develop [strong](https://www.theverge.com/c/24300623/ai-companions-replika-openai-chatgpt-assistant-romance) [attachments](https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/4/24144763/ai-chatbot-friends-character-teens) to [particular](https://www.theverge.com/news/756980/openai-chatgpt-users-mourn-gpt-5-4o) AIs. So the company is betting that giving people the freedom to put whatever agent they want at the heart of their phone will help differentiate them from competition like Apple and Google.

Of course, [Samsung’s next Unpacked](https://www.theverge.com/tech/876717/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-february-2026-s26) event is just around the corner. I’m sure we’ll hear more about Galaxy AI and Samsung’s vision for a multi-agent future on the [25th](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA93zbnoR4U).
