Sony’s pro-style controller, the DualSense Edge, might suffer from shorter battery life than the standard DualSense model, but it features great software integration with the PlayStation 5 and plenty of customizable components.

The DualSense Edge is significantly more customizable than Sony’s pack-in controller, with toggleable control schemes you can switch without leaving your game, mappable rear paddles, and swappable joysticks in case one breaks. On its back, there are switches that let you adjust the stopping point of its triggers, allowing either a full pull or a short and clicky feel. It’s also easy to tweak the joysticks’ deadzone and sensitivity levels.

In addition to being a great pairing with the PS5, the DualSense Edge is also compatible with Windows. Several PC games published by PlayStation Studios feature support for some of the controller’s unique features, too. The wireless controller’s only significant downside is that it’s limited to eight hours of battery life, which is a couple of hours shorter than Sony’s standard DualSense gamepad. It shouldn’t be an issue if you remember to charge the controller every few days, though.
