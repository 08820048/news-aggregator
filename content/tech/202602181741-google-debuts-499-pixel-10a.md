Google on Wednesday [introduced](https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/devices/pixel/google-pixel-10a/) its latest entry-level Pixel smartphone. The $499 Pixel 10a launches with new AI software capabilities and minor hardware updates. The smartphone is available for preorder now with shipments starting March 5.  It comes in Lavender, Berry, Fog, and Obsidian.

The Pixel 10a features a completely flat back, which means the camera bar blends with the back of the phone and lies flat when you place it down on a surface.

Google notes that the smartphone’s 6.3-inch Actua display is 11% brighter than the Pixel 9a. It also has faster charging than its predecessor, with more than 30 hours of battery life and up to 120 hours with the “Extreme Battery Saver” setting turned on.

The Pixel 10a comes with the same Tensor G4 chip that powered last year’s Pixel 9a. It features a 48MP main camera, which Google says is the best camera on a phone under $500, along with a 13MP ultrawide camera.

After first debuting on the Pixel 10 series last summer, Google is bringing a set of AI-powered camera features to the A-series phone. The “Auto Best Take” feature captures multiple frames in one shutter press and automatically selects the best version so everyone looks good in a group photo, while the “Camera Coach” feature gives users step-by-step guidance on lighting and composition.

Additionally, Google is bringing [Satellite SOS](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15254448?hl=en) to the A-series for the first time, allowing users to connect with emergency services even when they don’t have Wi-Fi or cellular service.

As with recent Pixel phones, the Pixel 10a will come with seven years of software and security updates.

It’s worth noting that the Pixel 10a doesn’t have the “PixelSnap” magnetic Qi charging feature on the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold.

The smartphone’s arrival comes just ahead of Apple’s upcoming new entry-level phone, [the iPhone 17e](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-08/apple-readies-iphone-17e-new-siri-entry-level-ipad-ipad-air-and-macbook-pro-mldr3hpk). The device is expected to cost $599, like last year’s iPhone 16e.

Google also announced that it’s launching [Pixel Buds 2a](https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/devices/pixel/google-pixel-buds-2a/) in two new colors, Berry and Fog, to go with the Pixel 10a.
