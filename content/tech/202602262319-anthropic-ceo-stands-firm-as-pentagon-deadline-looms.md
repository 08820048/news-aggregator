Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei [said Thursday](https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-department-of-war) that he “cannot in good conscience accede to \[the Pentagon’s\] request” to give the military unrestricted access to its AI systems.

“Anthropic understands that the Department of War, not private companies, makes military decisions,” Amodei wrote in a statement. “However, in a narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values. Some uses are also simply outside the bounds of what today’s technology can safely and reliably do.”

The two cases are: mass surveillance of Americans and fully autonomous weapons with no human in the loop. The Pentagon [believes](https://x.com/SeanParnellASW/status/2027072228777734474) it should be able to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes, and that its uses shouldn’t be dictated by a private company.

Amodei’s statement comes less than 24 hours ahead of the Friday 5:01 p.m. [deadline](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/24/anthropic-wont-budge-as-pentagon-escalates-ai-dispute/) Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has given Anthropic to either acquiesce to his demands, or face the consequences. The Department of Defense has [attempted to force Amodei’s hand](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/23/defense-secretary-summons-anthropics-amodei-over-military-use-of-claude/) by either labeling Anthropic a supply chain risk — a designation reserved for foreign adversaries — or invoke the Defense Production Act and effectively force the firm to do its bidding. The DPA gives the president the authority to force companies to prioritize or expand production for national defense.

Amodei pointed out the contradiction in those two threats. “One labels us a security risk; the other labels Claude as essential to national security.”

He added that it’s the Department’s right to choose contractors most aligned with its vision, “but given the substantial value that Anthropic’s technology provides to our armed forces, we hope they reconsider.”

Anthropic is currently the only frontier AI lab that has classified-ready systems for the military, though the DOD is reportedly getting xAI ready for the job.

“Our strong preference is to continue to serve the Department and our warfighters—with our two requested safeguards in place,” Amodei said. “Should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military planning, operations, or other critical missions.”

TLDR, he’s saying: “We can just part ways. There’s no need to be nasty about it.”
