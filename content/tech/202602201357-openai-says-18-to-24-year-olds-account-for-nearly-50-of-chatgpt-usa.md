OpenAI seems to have found product-market fit with young Indians. The company said on Friday that users between 18 and 24 years of age accounted for nearly 50% of messages sent to ChatGPT in the country, and users under 30 accounted for 80%.

The AI lab said Indians use ChatGPT mostly for work, with 35% of all messages relating to professional tasks, compared to 30% globally.

In particular, the company’s coding assistant, Codex, is seeing strong traction: OpenAI said Indians use Codex three times more than the global median, and weekly usage has increased by four times since the tool [got a Mac app](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/openai-launches-new-macos-app-for-agentic-coding/) two weeks ago. Users in India are also asking three times as many coding-related questions as the median.

This is in line with findings from Antropic, which earlier this week said [45.2% of Claude’s tasks map to software-related use cases](https://www.anthropic.com/research/india-brief-economic-index) in India.

OpenAI said outside of work tasks, 35% of messages to ChatGPT from Indians requested guidance, 20% concerned questions about general information, and 20% were requests for the bot to produce or help with writing.

India is OpenAI’s second-largest market with more than 100 million weekly users, and the company has been actively trying to court Indians for its AI tools and services. The company offers [a sub-$5 subscription tier](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/18/openai-launches-a-sub-5-chatgpt-plan-in-india/) in the country, and last year even [ran promotional campaigns](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/openai-offers-free-chatgpt-go-for-one-year-to-all-users-in-india/) to spur adoption.

“AI adoption is moving faster than our ability to measure it – and that’s a challenge for anyone trying to make smart decisions. Signals is our way of putting real-world evidence on the table, so India’s AI debate can be grounded in facts, not hype,” OpenAI’s chief economist Ronnie Chatterji said in a statement.
