On Wednesday, Apple released its latest iOS 26 update, which includes a new process for switching from an iPhone to an Android phone, as previously reported by [_9to5Mac_](https://9to5mac.com/2026/02/11/hands-on-ios-26-3-changes-and-features-video/). The updated transferring tool can move over data like apps, photos, messages, and even a user’s phone number by sitting the two phones side by side. Previously, users typically needed to either download [Apple](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.apple.movetoios%26hl%3Den_US) and [Google’s](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/android-switch/id6449987166) data transfer apps on each device or manually copy all their apps and data over.

iPhone users in the EU also now have an option for [“notification forwarding”](https://www.theverge.com/news/784477/apple-ios-26-beta-third-party-smartwatch-notifications) with third-party wearables in iOS 26.3. This update allows users to view the full contents of notifications on third-party wearables and control which apps they get notifications from, bringing the third-party smartwatch experience more in line with the Apple Watch. Improving interoperability between iPhones and non-Apple wearables, including features like notification functionality, was one of several requirements for Apple to comply with the EU’s [Digital Markets Act](https://www.theverge.com/24040543/eu-dma-digital-markets-act-big-tech-antitrust).

To install iOS 26.3 on your phone, open the Settings app and go to “General” then “Software Update.” If iOS 26.3 is available on your iPhone, you should see an option to download and install it. If that option isn’t showing up, double-check that your iPhone is [compatible with iOS 26](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iphone-models-compatible-with-ios-26-iphe3fa5df43/ios).
