Google is folding Alphabet’s AI robotics “moonshot,” Intrinsic, into the company after five years as an independent unit. The move marks a strategic shift as Google doubles down on physical AI and pulls experimental projects closer to its core business.

Intrinsic “[graduated](https://x.company/projects/intrinsic/)” [into an independent company](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590109/google-intrinsic-industrial-robotics-company-software) inside Alphabet’s Other Bets division in 2021, a portfolio of high-risk, speculative ventures that also includes robotaxi firm Waymo and healthcare company Verily. It pitches itself as an Android-like layer for robotics, building software and tools that make it easier to create robot applications.

Details of the purchase are not clear but the companies [said](https://www.intrinsic.ai/blog/posts/intrinsic-joins-google-to-accelerate-physical-ai) Intrinsic will remain a “distinct group within Google.” It will work closely with Google DeepMind and utilize Google’s Gemini AI models and cloud resources, they said. DeepMind [absorbed](https://x.company/projects/everyday-robots/) Alphabet’s [shuttered Everyday Robotics](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/24/23613214/everyday-robots-google-alphabet-shut-down) division in 2023 and last year [launched two AI models](https://www.theverge.com/news/628021/google-deepmind-gemini-robotics-ai-models) to help robots perform physical tasks.
