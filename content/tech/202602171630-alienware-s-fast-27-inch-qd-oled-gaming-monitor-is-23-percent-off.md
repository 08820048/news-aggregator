summary: "One of the best upgrades you can make to your gaming PC setup is an OLED monitor. Assuming that games already run great on your desktop or laptop, a monitor with per-pixel color and brightness control will make them look better than ever. If you’ve been shopping for one that’s on sale, Alienware’s 27-inch 1440p QD-OLED monitor is a fine candidate that just dropped to its lowest price yet, selling for $499.99 at Amazon and through Dell (originally $649.99). Alienware AW2725DF 1440p QD-OLED gaming monitor Alienware is a major player when it comes to OLED monitors. This 27-inch 360Hz model hits the sweet spot in terms of screen resolution, features, and — most importantly — price. Where to Buy: $649 $499.99 at Amazon $649 $499.99 at Dell It’s easy to find monitors of this size selling for slightly less, but the Alienware’s 360Hz refresh rate at 1440p resolution makes it stand out from the 240Hz offered by most others. The panel has a 111 pixels per inch (PPI) density, which is common among monitors of this size and price, and it features two DisplayPort ports and a single HDMI 2.1 port. It can only achieve 360Hz via DisplayPort, as its HDMI port caps out at 144Hz. No support for video over USB-C is a disappointment (since MSI’s often-cheaper QD-OLED at Costco has it), but its omission may not be an issue for you. Other great Verge-approved deals Numerous first-party Nintendo Switch titles are discounted in physical and digital formats, some of which have received free Switch 2 upgrades that improve performance and graphical fidelity. Prices range from $29.99 for some games to $39.99 for others. The likes of Amazon, Walmart, and GameStop are offering deals on games like Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD, Princess Peach: Showtime!, Splatoon 3, Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, Pikmin 4, The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening, and more (availability differs a bit depending on the retailer). Through February 22nd, you can get 30 percent off all movies on DVD, Blu-ray and 4K Blu-ray at Criterion. This sale also extends to preorders on movies that haven’t yet released. The catalog runs deep, filled with some well-known classics, like His Girl Friday, Eyes Wide Shut, and Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure. It’s a great place to fill your library with cult classics, too. These days, when I wonder whether a movie that got the Criterion Collection treatment is worth my money, reading a few reviews on Letterboxd usually guides me in the right direction. It’s not uncommon to find the Apple Watch Series 11 selling for as low as $299.99 in its smallest 42mm Wi-Fi / GPS configuration (in fact, it’s happening now for one color scheme at Walmart). However, if you’d like to save more money by instead getting the Series 10 in the 46mm configuration with Wi-Fi / GPS support, Walmart has a deal on that, too. It’s $229 for the silver aluminum model that includes the denim sport band, down from its original $429 price. The Series 11 claims to offer slightly better battery life and a more scratch-resistant display, but it otherwise pretty similar to the last-gen model. Read our review of the Series 11."
