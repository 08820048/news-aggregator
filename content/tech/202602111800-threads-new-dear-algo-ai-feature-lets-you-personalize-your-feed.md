[Threads](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/07/what-is-instagrams-threads-app-all-your-questions-answered/) is introducing an AI-powered feature that lets users personalize their feed, the Meta-owned social network announced on Wednesday. The platform’s new “Dear Algo” feature lets users tell Threads what they temporarily want to see more or less of in their feed.

To use the feature, users need to type “Dear Algo” in a public Threads post, followed by what they’d like to see more or less of. For example, if you want to see more content about popular podcasts, you can post “Dear algo, show me more posts about podcasts.” Your feed will be adjusted for three days after submitting a request.

It’s worth noting that because Dear Algo works through public postings, others are able to see your request, and they can even repost your request to apply it to their own feed. This aspect of the feature may be a hindrance for some users, as they might not want their requests to be public. However, Meta says it views this as a way for users to discover new conversations and topics, turning personalization into a community experience.

By allowing users to temporarily influence what appears on their feeds, Threads gains an edge over its competitors by offering a feature that isn’t available on rival platforms.

“Threads is where you go to keep up with what’s happening right now,” the company wrote in a blog post. “But sometimes, what matters to you changes in an instant, and you want your Threads feed to reflect that — whether it’s seeing more posts during a live NBA game or less about a TV show you haven’t caught up on yet.”

Although Threads and its competitors, X and Bluesky, already offer users a simple way to indicate their preferences with a ‘Not Interested’ button, the new Dear Algo feature takes personalization a step further. The feature could also help make Threads feel more real-time, something X has historically been known for.

Dear Algo is available now in the U.S., New Zealand, Australia, and the U.K. Threads plans to introduce it in more countries in the future.

The launch of the new feature comes a few weeks after a report from market intelligence firm [Similarweb](https://www.similarweb.com/) suggested that [Threads now surpasses X](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/18/threads-edges-out-x-in-daily-mobile-users-new-data-shows/) in daily mobile usage. Although X still dominates Threads on the web, the Threads mobile app for iOS and Android has continued to see an increase in daily active users over the past several months.

The report revealed that Threads had 141.5 million daily active users on mobile as of January 7, 2026, while X had 125 million daily active users.
