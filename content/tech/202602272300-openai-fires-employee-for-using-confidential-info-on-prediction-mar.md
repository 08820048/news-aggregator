OpenAI has fired an employee over the employee’s activity on prediction markets, including Polymarket, the company [confirmed to Wired.](https://www.wired.com/story/openai-fires-employee-insider-trading-polymarket-kalshi/) The employee used confidential OpenAI information in connection with the trades made, the company alleges.

OpenAI didn’t release the name of the employee. However, a spokesperson said that such actions violated a company policy that bans workers from using inside information for personal gain, including on prediction markets.

Prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi allow people to make wagers on the outcomes of real-world events. For instance, on Polymarket, there are wagers being made around the kind of products OpenAI will announce in 2026 and when the company will go public. They can cover any event, and some eye-popping money can be made. As we recently reported, [an accountant won a $470,300 jackpot on Kalshi](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/25/an-accountant-won-a-big-jackpot-on-kalshi-by-betting-against-doge/) by betting against DOGE believers.

Prediction markets insist they are not gambling sites, preferring to label themselves as financial platforms. Kalshi is a regulated exchange and, in fact, it [fined and banned a MrBeast editor for similar alleged insider trading](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/25/kalshi-fined-a-mrbeast-editor-for-insider-trading-on-markets-related-to-the-youtube-star/) earlier this week. OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment.
