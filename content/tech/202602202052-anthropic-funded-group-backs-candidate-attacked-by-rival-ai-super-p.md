Late last year, New York Assembly member Alex Bores became the target of a campaign by a pro-AI super PAC to thwart his congressional bid. The group, [Leading the Future](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/silicon-valley-is-pouring-millions-into-pro-ai-pacs-to-sway-midterms/), is armed with more than $100 million from backers including Andreessen Horowitz, OpenAI President Greg Brockman, AI search startup Perplexity, and Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale.

Bores’ response was simple: [bring it on.](https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/17/a16z-backed-super-pac-is-targeting-alex-bores-sponsor-of-new-yorks-ai-safety-bill-he-says-bring-it-on/) Now, he’s got the muscle to back that challenge up.

Public First Action, a PAC backed by a [$20 million donation from Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/donate-public-first-action), is spending $450,000 to boost Bores in the race for New York’s 12th congressional district, reports [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-19/anthropic-backed-group-jumps-into-new-york-congressional-race). Like its rival, the committee is pro-AI, but it’s pitching a different vision, one centered on transparency, safety standards, and public oversight.

Meanwhile, the industry-backed PAC, [Leading the Future](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/silicon-valley-is-pouring-millions-into-pro-ai-pacs-to-sway-midterms/), has already poured $1.1 million into ads attacking Bores, largely because he sponsored [New York’s RAISE Act,](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/20/new-york-governor-kathy-hochul-signs-raise-act-to-regulate-ai-safety/) which requires major AI developers to disclose safety protocols and report serious misuse of their systems.
