summary: "The 11-inch iPad Pro is down to a new low price. | Photo: David Pierce / The Verge While the best iPad deals usually land during major sale events like Black Friday, many great iPad deals are available outside of those times. The day-to-day discounts come and go like changing winds, so there’s often some amount to be saved, particularly on Apple’s most affordable iPad, the iPad Mini, and the latest iPad Air. Hell, you can even often find discounts on the latest M5 iPad Pro, which is already on sale at multiple retailers. All that being said, it’s difficult to know where exactly you can find the most notable iPad deals unless you’re scouring the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at The Verge are doing, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve rounded up the best prices on every current iPad model, from the 11th-gen base iPad to the more powerful models with the M3, M4, and M5 chips. Before we dive in, though, it’s worth noting that Apple is holding a “special Apple experience” in New York City on March 4th. While it’s unclear what exactly will be announced, recent rumors hint at an M4-powered iPad Air and a new entry-level iPad with support for Apple Intelligence. If you’d rather not wait and see, though, here are the best deals available. The best iPad (2025) deals Apple iPad (11th-gen) Where to Buy: $349 $321 at Amazon (128GB, Wi-Fi) $449 $413 at Amazon (256GB, Wi-Fi) $349 at Walmart (128GB, Wi-Fi) Apple’s 11th-gen iPad landed on the scene in March. The newest base-model tablet is a fairly iterative update of the prior model, but with 128GB of base storage (up from 64GB) and an A16 Bionic chip, which is nearly 30 percent faster than the A14 chip used in the 10th-gen iPad. However, the newer chip doesn’t support the various Apple Intelligence features introduced in iPadOS 18.1 and subsequent updates. For that, you’ll want to opt for a more recent iPad Air, iPad Mini, or iPad Pro model. Pricing-wise, the latest iPad starts at $349 with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage. You can also upgrade to 256GB or 512GB of storage for an additional $100 or $200, respectively, or purchase an LTE model starting at $499. We saw a pretty significant price drop to $279 on Black Friday, but right now it’s only available at Amazon starting at $321, which saves you $28. Alternatively, if you need more storage, you can buy the 256GB model at Amazon starting at $413 ($36 off), or the 512GB variant at Amazon starting at $599 ($50 off). The best iPad Mini (2024) deals iPad Mini (2024) Where to Buy: $499 $474 at Amazon (128GB, Wi-Fi) $499 at Best Buy (128GB, Wi-Fi) $599 $569 at Amazon (256GB, Wi-Fi) The seventh-gen iPad Mini is similar in several ways to the previous model, but comes with some big internal upgrades. It includes faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds, support for the Apple Pencil Pro, and a newer A17 Pro processor with 8GB of RAM to support Apple Intelligence. Otherwise, it boasts nearly identical specs and features as the last-gen model, meaning it has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display and options for 5G. It may not be worth upgrading if you already own a sixth-gen Mini, but newcomers to the category will appreciate the upgrades. The 2024 iPad Mini starts at $499 with 128GB of storage, which was the price for the previous generation’s 64GB model. Electing for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $599, and the cellular models start at $649. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, so the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want an Apple tablet in the smallest possible form factor, this is where the action is. Right now, the 128GB base model with Wi-Fi is on sale at Amazon starting at $474, which is a far cry from its all-time low of $349 but still a $25 discount. If you need additional storage, you can pick up the 256GB variant at Amazon for $569 ($30 off), which is about $90 shy of the lowest price we’ve seen on the step-up configuration. The best iPad Air (2025) deals 11-inch iPad Air M3 Where to Buy: $599 $499 at Walmart (128GB, Wi-Fi) $599 $489 at Amazon (128GB, Wi-Fi) $699 $589 at Amazon (256GB, Wi-Fi) 13-inch iPad Air M3 Where to Buy: $899 $779 at Amazon (256GB, Wi-Fi) $1099 $979 at Amazon (512GB, Wi-Fi) $799 $699 at Walmart (128GB, Wi-Fi) The 2025 iPad Air is little more than a spec bump over the previous model, with a few technical upgrades that should allow it to last longer into the future than either the entry-level iPad or the last-gen Air. It features an M3 chip with support for Apple Intelligence, plus compatibility with Apple’s latest Magic Keyboard that has a larger trackpad and an extra row of function keys. In short, the Air is a credible laptop replacement. The 11-inch model starts at $599 and the 13-inch variant $799 — the same price as prior models — but it’s common to see discounts from third-party retailers. Right now, for instance, the 11-inch Air is on sale at Amazon in its base configuration with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage starting at $489 ($110 off). If you need more storage, you can grab the 256GB model at Amazon starting at $589 ($110 off), or the step-up 512GB model at Amazon for $779 ($120 off). All models are currently $30 more than their lowest price to date. The larger 13-inch model, meanwhile, is on sale at Walmart with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage starting at $699 ($120 off), which is $50 shy of its best price to date. You can also grab the 256GB model at Amazon starting at $779 ($120 off), or the step-up 512GB model at Amazon for $979 ($120 off). The best iPad Pro (2025) deals 11-inch iPad Pro (M5, 2025) Where to Buy: $1199 $999.99 at Amazon (512GB, Wi-Fi) $1599 $1399.99 at Amazon (1TB, Wi-Fi) $999 $899 at B&H Photo (256GB, Wi-Fi) 13-inch iPad Pro (2025) Where to Buy: $1299 $1220 at Amazon (256GB, Wi-Fi) $1499 $1399 at Amazon (512GB, Wi-Fi) $1899 $1775.99 at Amazon (1TB, Wi-Fi) While there are some deals floating around for the M4 iPad Pro, we’d argue none of them are particularly noteworthy given the current discounts on the 2025 iPad Pro. Apple’s latest high-end tablet offers a few upgrades over the last-gen model, including a faster M5 chip, a new C1X cellular modem (if you get the cellular version), and an N1 chip that handles Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Thread. Apple also increased read and write speeds to its memory, and the latest Pro supports fast charging, allowing you to charge it to 50 percent capacity in about 30 minutes. Although the tablet launched in October, we’re already seeing the price drop at several retailers. The 11-inch base model with 256GB of storage is currently down to $899 ($100 off) at B&H Photo, for instance, while the model with 512GB of storage is going for an all-time low of $999.99 (200 off) at Amazon. You can also snag the 1TB variant for $1,399.99 ($200 off) at Amazon. If you want a larger display, you can get the 13-inch iPad Pro in its 256GB base configuration for $1,220 ($79 off) at Amazon. Meanwhile, the step-up model with Wi-Fi and 512GB of storage is down to $1,399 (also $100 off) at Amazon, while the 1TB model can be had at Amazon for $1,775.99 (about $123 off). Update, February 18th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and flag Apple’s upcoming ”experience” in New York City."

While there are some deals floating around for the [M4 iPad Pro](https://www.theverge.com/24155440/apple-ipad-pro-2024-review), we’d argue none of them are particularly noteworthy given the current discounts on the [2025 iPad Pro](https://www.theverge.com/news/799352/apple-ipad-pro-m5-price-release-date). Apple’s latest high-end tablet offers a few upgrades over the last-gen model, including a faster M5 chip, a new C1X cellular modem (if you get the cellular version), and an N1 chip that handles Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Thread. Apple also increased read and write speeds to its memory, and the latest Pro supports fast charging, allowing you to charge it to 50 percent capacity in about 30 minutes.

Although the tablet launched in October, we’re already seeing the price drop at several retailers. The 11-inch base model with 256GB of storage is currently down to $899 ($100 off) at [B&H Photo](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1925484-REG%2Fapple_mdwk4ll_a_11_ipad_pro_m5.html), for instance, while the model with 512GB of storage is going for an all-time low of $999.99 (200 off) at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Pro-11-inch-Landscape/dp/B0FWD177ZC/?tag=theverge02-20). You can also snag the 1TB variant for $1,399.99 ($200 off) at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Pro-11-inch-Landscape/dp/B0FWD1N7DQ/?th=1&tag=theverge02-20).

If you want a larger display, you can get the 13-inch iPad Pro in its 256GB base configuration for $1,220 ($79 off) [at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FWD1MS82/?tag=theverge02-20). Meanwhile, the step-up model with Wi-Fi and 512GB of storage is down to $1,399 (also $100 off) [at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FWD64873/?tag=theverge02-20), while the 1TB model can be had at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FWD6SPL8/?tag=theverge02-20) for $1,775.99 (about $123 off).
