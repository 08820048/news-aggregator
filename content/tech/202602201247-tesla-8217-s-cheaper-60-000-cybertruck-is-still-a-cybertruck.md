Tesla has announced a new all-wheel drive Cybertruck that starts at $59,990, the cheapest the controversial truck has been sold for yet — though still well above the $40,000 price tag Elon Musk had initially promised. It’s been joined by a $15,000 price cut for the high-end Cyberbeast variant, as Tesla doubles down on its efforts to turn slow Cybertruck sales around.

The new dual motor AWD variant is available now from [Tesla’s site](https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck/design#overview). It’s cheaper than the [rear-wheel drive version](https://www.theverge.com/news/647060/tesla-cybertruck-rwd-long-lange-model-launch-entry) that was launched last year and discontinued a few short months later, but includes features not seen on that model like a powered tonneau cover, bed outlets, and adaptive damping. The only downside is a slightly shorter range thanks to the second motor: 325 miles instead of 350.

The price may not last long though — in a [reply posted on X](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2024817036241871001), Musk said that the AWD Cybertruck will cost $59,990 “for the next 10 days,” though gave no further indication on what will happen after that.

At the same time, Tesla has reduced the price of the tri-motor Cyberbeast to $99,990. If that sounds familiar it’s because it’s back at this price for the third time. The Cyberbeast launched at $99,990, then went up by $20,000, back down by the same, up again by $15,000, and is now right back at square one. I guess that means if you’re tempted you should go for it, because there’s no telling when the price will go back up.

Then again, you might expect Tesla to keep Cybertrucks as cheap as it can. Sales plummeted 48 percent in 2025 [according to one estimate](https://www.theverge.com/transportation/864544/the-tesla-cybertrucks-highway-to-sales-hell), to just over 20,000 trucks across the whole year — just a little below Musk’s early predictions that Tesla would sell 250,000 Cybertrucks a year.

**_Update, February 20th:_** _Added Elon Musk post indicating the new low price may be temporary._
