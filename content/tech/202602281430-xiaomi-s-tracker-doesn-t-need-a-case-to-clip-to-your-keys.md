Xiaomi has announced its first Bluetooth tracker, and while the Xiaomi Tag has a more elongated design than the [Apple AirTag](https://www.theverge.com/tech/875314/airtags-second-gen-review-item-tracker), that lets you use it in more places right out of the box. On one end of the tracker you’ll find an integrated metal loop that can be attached to a keyring or clipped to a carabiner without the need for an extra case.

The Xiaomi Tag is compatible with both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub tracking networks and mobile apps, but not at the same time. You’ll need to choose one or the other during setup. Like Apple’s AirTag, the Xiaomi Tag is powered by a replaceable CR2032 coin cell battery good for up to a year of use, and boasts an IP67 dust and water resistance rating, so it can survive a short dunking. There are also NFC capabilities that others can use to load your contact details should they find a lost device with the tag attached.

One big differentiator is that unlike Apple’s AirTags, the Xiaomi Tag lacks ultra wideband (UWB) functionality for pinpointing its exact location. You’ll instead have to rely on audible alerts to locate it once you’re nearby. If that’s not a deal-breaker, the Xiaomi Tag will be a cheaper alternative to Apple’s AirTags, selling for £12.99 (around $18) each, or £44.99 (around $61) for a four-pack. A single second-gen [AirTag is $29](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirTag-2nd-Generation-Precision/dp/B0GJTFXNRX/ref=sr_1_3?th=1&tag=theverge02-20), or [$99 for four](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirTag-2nd-Generation-Precision/dp/B0GJTXVN9Z/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?th=1&tag=theverge02-20).
