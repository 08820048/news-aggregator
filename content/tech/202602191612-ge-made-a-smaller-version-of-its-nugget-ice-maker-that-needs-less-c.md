GE has [announced two new versions of its popular Opal nugget ice machines](https://pressroom.geappliances.com/news/releases-20260205-6916472) with smaller footprints that take up less counter space, and more affordable price tags. Like GE’s larger and pricier [Opal 2.0 Ultra](https://www.theverge.com/24191807/ge-profile-opal-2-0-ultra-nugget-ice-maker-review), the two new machines make nugget ice — frequently also referred to as chewable ice, or pellet ice — by freezing layers of ice flakes producing nuggets that are easier to chew with more surface area to cool drinks faster.

Previously only available in restaurants, GE launched its first Opal machine for making ice nuggets at home back in 2015. Recent models, like the Opal 2.0 Ultra, start at a steep $579, but the new GE Profile Opal Mini is expected to cost $299 when it becomes available sometime in July 2026, while the GE Profile Opal Mini Pro will be $379.

The entry-level GE Profile Opal Mini is much smaller than other Opal models because it ditches a water tank on the side for a built-in reservoir that fills from the top. It can still produce up to 34 pounds of ice per day if you’re diligently emptying and refilling it, and includes a filter to improve the taste of the nuggets, and an automatic descale function. But as _The Verge_’s Jennifer Pattison Tuohy found while reviewing the Opal 2.0 Ultra, these machines can still be arduous to clean.

The Pro version of the GE Profile Opal Mini includes a side tank so you don’t have to refill it as frequently (at the cost of a larger footprint) as well as a filter that inhibits scale buildup, a stainless steel ice scoop, and more premium stainless steel finishes (color options are still being finalized). The Pro model also includes Wi-Fi connectivity so the appliance can be scheduled from a mobile app, or send notifications for maintenance issues.
