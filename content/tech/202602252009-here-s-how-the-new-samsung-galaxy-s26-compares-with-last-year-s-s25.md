The S26 and S26 Plus both cost $100 more, though the base model contains more upgrades to warrant the price increase.

Samsung unveiled its Galaxy S26 lineup at its recent Unpacked event in San Francisco. As expected, the new series consists of the baseline S26, which starts at $899.99, and the bigger S26 Plus, which starts at $1,099.99. At the high end, there’s also the $1,299.99 S26 Ultra, which is the largest in the lineup and comes with a bigger battery, better cameras, S Pen support, and expanded options for both storage and RAM. The price difference between Samsung’s cheapest and most expensive S26 phones is $400 (last year, it was $500).

While some of its updated Galaxy AI software features are new, it’s another year of minor hardware updates for Samsung’s flagship phones. However, there are some notable changes that you should know about upfront. The base S26 costs $100 more than last year’s model, but comes with 256GB of storage instead of 128GB. It also has a bigger battery and a slightly larger 6.3-inch screen (not great news if you appreciated the S25’s smaller size), but it’s now missing mmWave 5G support. The S26 Plus is $100 more, yet, as noted in the chart below, it offers even fewer upgrades.

If you want a side-by-side comparison of how the Galaxy S26 lineup fares in terms of specs to the last-gen models, we’ve made a table for your perusal. All of the new phones are up for [preorder starting today, February 25th](https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/883829/samsung-galaxy-s26-plus-ultra-how-to-buy-preorder-price-release-date), and will ship on March 11th. Samsung also announced the forthcoming [Galaxy Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro](https://www.theverge.com/e/884434), which are also available for preorder starting today ahead of their release on March 11th.
