[Boston Dynamics](https://techcrunch.com/tag/boston-dynamics/), the Massachusetts robotics company known for its four-legged robots and humanoids, is going through a leadership change. 

Robert Playter announced in an internal memo on Tuesday that he would be stepping down as the company’s chief executive, [as first reported by A3](https://www.automate.org/robotics/industry-insights/boston-dynamics-ceo-robert-playter-steps-down). Amanda McMaster, the company’s chief financial officer, will stand in for the top job while the company looks for a replacement.  

TechCrunch reached out to Boston Dynamics for more information.  

Playter took the helm at Boston Dynamics in 2020, taking over from founder Marc Raibert. Playter worked at Boston Dynamics for 30 years, where he held other roles, including vice president of engineering and chief operating officer.  

Boston Dynamics was founded in 1992 by Raibert as a spinoff from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was a professor. Google’s parent company Alphabet bought Boston Dynamics in 2013, before the company was sold to Japanese investing conglomerate SoftBank in 2017.

Hyundai, its current owner, acquired the company in 2021.

The robotics producer is best known for its quadruped robot, Spot, which the company commercialized in 2020 shortly after Playter took the helm. The company most recently announced Atlas, a humanoid robot.
