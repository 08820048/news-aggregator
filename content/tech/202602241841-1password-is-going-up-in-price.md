1Password is increasing its prices on March 27th, 2026. In an email sent to users, the password manager says it will raise the price of its yearly individual plan from $35.88 to $47.88, and that its family plan is going from $59.88 to $71.88.

“While 1Password has grown substantially in value and capability, our pricing has remained largely unchanged for many years,” 1Password’s email states. 1Password says that the price increase will help it “continue investing in innovation and the world-class security you expect.” The email lists some of the new features the company has recently added to the platform, such as the ability to save logins and payment details, [protection against phishing,](https://www.theverge.com/tech/864980/1password-security-phishing-attack-prevention-password-browser-extension-scammers) and faster device setup.

As noted by 1Password, the price increase will go into effect during your next plan renewal, as long as it’s after March 27th. _The Verge_ reached out to 1Password with a request for more information about whether the price changes will affect its monthly plans, but didn’t immediately hear back.
