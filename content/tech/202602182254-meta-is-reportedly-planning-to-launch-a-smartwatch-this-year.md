Meta is planning to launch a smartwatch with health tracking and AI features later this year, along with an updated version of its [Meta Ray-Ban Display](https://www.theverge.com/tech/779566/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-smart-glasses-price-battery-specs) smart glasses, [_The Information_](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-revives-plan-smart-watch-targets-2026-launch) reports. The smartwatch would arrive ahead of a pair of mixed reality glasses, code-named Phoenix, that Meta has reportedly delayed until 2027 amidst efforts to streamline the company’s AR and MR roadmap.

Meta previously [scrapped plans for an earlier smartwatch](https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/9/23160921/meta-dual-camera-smartwatch-activity-tracker-metaverse-controller) in 2022 due to technical challenges and cost-cutting measures. If the new watch, code-named Malibu 2, comes to fruition, it would intensify competition with Apple, which is rumored to be [working on a pair of AI smart glasses](https://www.theverge.com/tech/880293/apple-ai-hardware-smart-glasses-pin-airpods) that could launch next year, potentially rivaling Meta’s line of glasses. Meta would also face significant competition for users’ wrist space from Google, Garmin, Samsung, Fitbit, and others.

The Malibu 2 smartwatch follows Meta’s launch of its Ray-Ban Display AR glasses last year, which the company said proved popular enough that they had to [pause the glasses’ international launch](https://www.theverge.com/news/856216/meta-ray-ban-display-smart-glasses-international-expansion-paused) due to “unprecedented demand and limited inventory.” The Ray-Ban Display glasses use a neural wristband for gesture controls, which could potentially be replaced by a smartwatch.
