OpenAI CEO Sam Altman addressed concerns about AI’s environmental impact this week while [speaking at an event hosted by The Indian Express](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH7thwrCluM).

For one thing, Altman — who was [in India for a major AI summit](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/19/all-the-important-news-from-the-ongoing-india-ai-summit/) — said concerns about AI’s water usage are “totally fake,” though he acknowledged it was a real issue when “we used to do evaporative cooling in data centers.”

“Now that we don’t do that, you see these things on the internet where, ‘Don’t use ChatGPT, it’s 17 gallons of water for each query’ or whatever,” Altman said. “This is completely untrue, totally insane, no connection to reality.”

He added that it’s “fair” to be concerned about “the energy consumption — not per query, but in total, because the world is now using so much AI.” In his view, this means the world needs to “move towards nuclear or wind and solar very quickly.”

There’s no legal requirement for tech companies to disclose how much energy and water they use, so scientists have been [trying to study it independently](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/07/1249592906/energy-water-ai-climate-tech). Data centers have also been connected to [rising electricity prices](https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/01/rising-energy-prices-put-ai-and-data-centers-in-the-crosshairs/).

Citing a previous conversation with Bill Gates, the interviewer asked whether it’s accurate to say a single ChatGPT query currently uses the equivalent of 1.5 iPhone battery charges, to which Altman replied, “There’s no way it’s anything close to that much.”

Altman also complained that many discussions about ChatGPT’s energy usage are “unfair,” especially when they focus on “how much energy it takes to train an AI model, relative to how much it costs a human to do one inference query.”

“But it also takes a lot of energy to train a human,” Altman said. “It takes like 20 years of life and all of the food you eat during that time before you get smart. And not only that, it took the very widespread evolution of the 100 billion people that have ever lived and learned not to get eaten by predators and learned how to figure out science and whatever, to produce you.”

So in his view, the fair comparison is, “If you ask ChatGPT a question, how much energy does it take once its model is trained to answer that question versus a human? And probably, AI has already caught up on an energy efficiency basis, measured that way.”

You can watch the full interview below. The conversation about water and energy usage begins at around 26:35.
