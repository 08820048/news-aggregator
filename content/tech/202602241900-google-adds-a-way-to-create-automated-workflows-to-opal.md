Google on Tuesday announced it’s adding a new way to create automated workflows to [its vibe-coding app Opal.](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/25/google-is-testing-a-vibe-coding-app-called-opal/) The company said that a new agent being introduced in Opal will allow users to create mini apps that can let them plan and execute tasks using text prompts.

The feature uses the Gemini 3 Flash model and automatically chooses tools to execute tasks. For instance, it can use Google Sheets to maintain memory across sessions, such as a shopping list for an e-commerce-related app. The new agent creates and plans the next step for the tasks on its own.

Google said these agents are natively interactive, which means that if they need more information, they would ask users to enter it or offer them choices to determine next steps, if needed. With this addition, users without technical knowledge could build complex workflows within their apps, the company claims.

The vibe-cooling tool [Opal was first introduced](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/25/google-is-testing-a-vibe-coding-app-called-opal/) for U.S. users in July 2025. The tool lets anyone create mini web apps or remix existing apps. In October 2025, the company rolled out Opal to users in 15 more countries, including Canada, India, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, Brazil, and Singapore. And in December, Google [added the tool to the Gemini web app](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/googles-vibe-coding-tool-opal-comes-to-gemini/), allowing users to create custom apps through a visual editor without writing any code.

Beyond Google, many other startups are also building tools that let users build apps via natural language prompts. [Lovable](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/lovable-on-track-to-raise-150m-at-2b-valuation/) and [Replit](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/replit-hits-3b-valuation-on-150m-annualized-revenue/) are among the more popular ones, but other startups like [former Replika founder’s Wabi](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/rocket-new-one-of-indias-first-vibe-coding-startups-snags-15m-from-accel-salesforce-ventures/), [Softbank and Lightspeed-backed Emergent](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/indian-vibe-coding-startup-emergent-raises-70m-at-300m-valuation-from-softbank-khosla-ventures/), and [Accel-backed Rocket.new](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/rocket-new-one-of-indias-first-vibe-coding-startups-snags-15m-from-accel-salesforce-ventures/) are also gaining prominence.
