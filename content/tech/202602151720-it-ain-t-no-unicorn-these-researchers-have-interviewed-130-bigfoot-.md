summary: "What prompts this community to spend time looking for a creature that likely doesn't exist?"
---
_It was the image that launched a cultural icon. In 1967, in the Northern California woods, a 7-foot-tall, ape-like creature covered in black fur and walking upright was captured on camera, at one point turning around to look straight down the lens. The image is endlessly copied in popular culture—it’s even become an emoji. But what was it? A hoax? A bear? Or a real-life example of a mysterious species called the Bigfoot?_

_The film has been analysed and re-analysed [countless times](https://www.discoveryuk.com/mysteries/the-patterson-gimlin-film-evidence-of-bigfoot-or-elaborate-hoax/). Although most people believe it was some sort of hoax, there are some who argue that it’s never been definitively debunked. One group of people, dubbed Bigfooters, is so intrigued that they have taken to the forests of Washington, California, Oregon, Ohio, Florida, and beyond to look for evidence of the mythical creature._

_But why? That’s what sociologists Jamie Lewis and Andrew Bartlett wanted to uncover. They were itching to understand what prompts this community to spend valuable time and resources looking for a beast that is highly unlikely to even exist. During lockdown, Lewis started interviewing more than 130 Bigfooters (and a few academics) about their views, experiences, and practices, culminating in [the duo’s recent book](https://www.routledge.com/Bigfooters-and-Scientific-Inquiry-On-the-Borderlands-of-Legitimate-Science/Lewis-Bartlett/p/book/9781032777832) “Bigfooters and Scientific Inquiry: On the Borderlands of Legitimate Science.”_

_Here, we talk to them about their academic investigation._

## What was it about the Bigfoot community that you found so intriguing?

**Lewis**: It started when I was watching either the Discovery Channel or Animal Planet and a show called _Finding Bigfoot_ was advertised. I was really keen to know why this program was being scheduled on what certainly at the time was a nominally serious and sober natural history channel. The initial plan was to do an analysis of these television programmes, but we felt that wasn’t enough. It was lockdown and my wife was pregnant and in bed a lot with sickness, so I needed to fill my time.

**Bartlett**: One of the things that I worked on when Jamie and I shared an office in Cardiff was a [sociological study of fringe physicists](https://direct.mit.edu/posc/article-abstract/25/4/411/15535/Demarcating-Fringe-Science-for-Policy). These are people mostly outside of academic institutions trying to do science. I was interviewing these people, going to their conferences. And that led relatively smoothly into Bigfoot, but it was Jamie’s interest in Bigfoot that brought me to this field.

## How big is this community?

**Lewis**: It’s very hard to put a number on it. There is certainly a divide between what are known as “apers,” who believe that Bigfoot is just a primate unknown to science, and those that are perhaps more derogatorily called “woo-woos,” who believe that Bigfoot is some sort of interdimensional traveller, an alien of sort. We’re talking in the thousands of people. But there are a couple of hundred really serious people of which I probably interviewed at least half.

Many people back them. A [YouGov survey](https://ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/documents/UFOs_and_space_exploration_poll_results.pdf) conducted as recently as November 2025, suggested that as many as one quarter of Americans believe that Bigfoot either definitely or probably exists.

## Were the interviewees suspicious of your intentions?

**Lewis**: I think there was definitely a worry that they would be caricatured. And I was often asked, “Do I believe in Bigfoot?” I had a standard answer that Andy and I agreed on, which was that mainstream, institutional science says there is absolutely no compelling evidence that Bigfoot exists. We have no reason to dissent with that consensus. But as sociologists what does exist is a community (or communities) of Bigfooting, and that’s what interests us.
