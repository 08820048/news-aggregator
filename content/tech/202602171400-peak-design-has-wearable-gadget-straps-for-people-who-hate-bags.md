Peak Design is launching a lineup of [mobile straps](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peakdesign.com%2Fproducts%2Fmobile-straps) for carrying small gadgets and other essentials around without dumping them into a bag. There are three versions available starting today: a $29.95 Mobile Cuff for your wrist, a $49.95 two-point Crossbody Strap, and a $59.95 Crossbody Multi-Strap that allows you to carry several items at once using anchor attachments.

Peak Design’s straps feature a corded rope that was custom-developed for “strength, comfort, and stretch” and are compatible with any Peak Design or Apple iPhone 17 case, and any third-party case if paired with the included adapter. The anchor attachments for the Crossbody Multi-Strap are each rated to withstand 50 pounds (23 kilograms) of force per attachment point and can carry items like “compact, lightweight point-and-shoot cameras.” So, not heavier mirrorless or DSLR cameras.

The images of Peak Design’s Crossbody Multi-Strap make it look a little like climbing gear when multiple objects are hanging off it. Honestly, at that point, a small bag or sling probably makes more sense, especially for anyone carrying an AirPods case that could easily fling open.

Carry straps for smartphones are already popular across Europe and Asia. Peak Design’s straps follow the launch of Apple’s [$59 iPhone crossbody strap](https://www.theverge.com/report/775498/apple-iphone-crossbody-strap-magnetic-reaction) last year that features a flat design and magnetic length adjustment.
