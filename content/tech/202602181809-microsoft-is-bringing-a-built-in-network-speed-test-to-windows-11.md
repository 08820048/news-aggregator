Microsoft is working on a bunch of new features for Windows 11, including a new network speed test that you can access from your taskbar. The tool is bundled in an [update rolling out to Windows 11 Insiders](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2026/02/17/releasing-windows-11-builds-26100-7918-and-26200-7918-to-the-release-preview-channel/) in the Release Preview Channel, allowing you to right-click the network icon in the system tray to access a speed test option that opens in your default browser.

From there, you can check how fast your connection is over Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or cellular data. Microsoft first started [testing this feature last year](https://www.theverge.com/news/777917/windows-11s-taskbar-is-getting-quick-access-to-speed-tests), and it could offer a convenient alternative to checking your connection speed by navigating to third-party websites.

There’s also a new camera settings option coming to the Settings menu, giving you the ability to control the pan and tilt for supported cameras (though Microsoft doesn’t say which devices work with the new feature). Microsoft is adding new emoji to Windows 11, too, a full-page Widget settings menu, and the ability to set .webp files as your desktop background.

You can check out the update via the Release Preview Channel. It’s rolling out now to Windows 11 versions 24H2 (Build 26100) and 25H2 (Build 26200).
