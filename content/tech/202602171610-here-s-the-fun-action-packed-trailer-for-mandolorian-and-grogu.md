At long last, we have the official full trailer for [_The Mandalorian and Grogu_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian_and_Grogu), a feature film spinoff from Disney’s megahit Star Wars series [_The_ _Mandalorian_](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/01/reunited-din-djarin-and-grogu-face-new-battles-in-the-mandalorian-s3-trailer/).

Grogu (fka “Baby Yoda”) [won viewers’ hearts](https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/09/our-fave-star-wars-duo-is-back-in-mandalorian-and-grogu-teaser/) from the moment he first appeared onscreen in the first season of _The Mandalorian_, and the relationship between the little green creature and his father-figure bounty hunter, the titular Mandalorian, Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal), has only gotten stronger. With the 2023 Hollywood strikes delaying production on season 4 of the series, director Jon Favreau got the green light to make this spinoff film.

Per the official logline:

> The evil Empire has fallen, and Imperial warlords remain scattered throughout the galaxy. As the fledgling New Republic works to protect everything the Rebellion fought for, they have enlisted the help of legendary Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) and his young apprentice Grogu.

In addition to Pascal, the cast includes Sigourney Weaver as Ward, a veteran pilot, colonel, and leader of the New Republic’s Adelphi Rangers. Jeremy Allen White plays Rotta the Hutt (son of Jabba, first introduced in 2008’s _The Clone Wars_), Jonny Coyne reprises his _Mandalorian_ S3 role as an Imperial warlord leading a surviving faction of the Galactic Empire, and Dave Filoni will be back as New Republic X-wing pilot Trapper Wolf. We can also expect to see Garazeb (“Zeb”) Orrelios (Steve Blum) from the _Star Wars Rebels_ animated series, Embo from _The Clone Wars_, and Anzellan aliens from _[The Rise of Skywalker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Rise_of_Skywalker "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker")._ There’s also a shiny new version of Mando’s ship (destroyed in S2).
