Anthropic’s chatbot Claude seems to have benefited from the attention around the company’s fraught negotiations with the Pentagon.

As [first reported by CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/28/anthropics-claude-apple-apps.html), as of Saturday afternoon, Claude is currently ranked number two among free apps in Apple’s US App Store — the number one app is OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and number three is Google Gemini.

According to [data from SensorTower](https://app.sensortower.com/overview/6473753684?country=US&tab=category_rankings), Claude was just outside the top 100 at the end of January, and has spent most of February somewhere in the top 20. Its ranking has climbed in the last few days, from sixth on Wednesday to fourth on Thursday to second on Saturday (today).

After Anthropic attempted to negotiate for safeguards preventing the Department of Defense from using its AI models for mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons, President Donald Trump directed federal agencies to stop using all Anthropic products and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said he’s [designating the company a supply-chain threat](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/27/pentagon-moves-to-designate-anthropic-as-a-supply-chain-risk/).

OpenAI subsequently [announced its own agreement with the Pentagon](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/28/openais-sam-altman-announces-pentagon-deal-with-technical-safeguards/), which CEO Sam Altman claimed includes safeguards related to domestic surveillance and autonomous weapons.
