Starting on Tuesday, WordPress users can edit their websites using the [new AI assistant](https://wordpress.com/blog/2026/02/17/wordpress-ai-assistant/) built into the platform’s site editor and media library, [_TechCrunch_](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/wordpress-com-adds-an-ai-assistant-that-can-edit-adjust-styles-create-images-and-more/) reports. The AI has a sidebar in the WordPress site editor where users can ask it to edit and translate text, generate and edit images using Google’s Nano Banana, and make adjustments to their sites like creating new pages or changing fonts.

Users can also interact with the AI through the new [block notes feature](https://wordpress.org/download/releases/6-9/) WordPress added in its 6.9 update in December, which allows users to leave comments in the site editor. By tagging the AI assistant with “@ai” in block notes, users can give it prompts like asking it to edit a specific block of text or suggest a headline.

To try out the AI assistant, users have to manually enable it by going into their site’s settings and toggling on “AI tools.” Sites that were made with the [AI website builder](https://www.theverge.com/news/645993/wordpress-com-is-offering-a-new-ai-site-builder) WordPress launched last year will have AI tools enabled by default.
