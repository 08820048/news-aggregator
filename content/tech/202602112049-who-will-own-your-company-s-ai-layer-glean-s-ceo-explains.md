Enterprise AI is shifting fast from chatbots that answer questions to systems that actually do the work across an organization. But who will own the AI layer that powers all of it? 

[Glean](https://www.glean.com/), which started as an enterprise search product, has evolved into what it calls an “AI work assistant,” aiming to sit underneath other AI experiences, connecting to internal systems, managing permissions, and delivering intelligence wherever employees work. Investors are buying into the vision, too — the startup raised [$150 million last year at a $7.2 billion valuation](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/enterprise-ai-startup-glean-lands-a-7-2b-valuation/) as more competition heats up against tech giants bundling AI. 

Watch as [Equity](https://techcrunch.com/podcasts/equity/) host Rebecca Bellan sits down with Glean’s CEO and founder Arvind Jain at Web Summit Qatar to break down how enterprises are thinking about AI architecture, what’s driving consolidation, and what’s real versus hype in the agent space.
