Reddit [announced](https://redditinc.com/news/in-case-you-saw-it-we-are-testing-a-new-shopping-product-experience-in-search) on Thursday that it’s testing a new AI search tool that takes community recommendations and matches them with products from some of the company’s shopping and advertising partners.

A small group of users in the U.S. will start to see search results that include interactive product carousels with pricing, images, and direct where-to-buy links.

The announcement reflects Reddit’s broader push to combine its community-driven platform with e-commerce capabilities. The move comes as Reddit launched its [first shoppable ad product](https://www.business.reddit.com/blog/dynamic-product-ads-launch) last year, called Dynamic Product Ads (DPA), which display personalized product recommendations to users based on their interests.

Now, when users who are part of the test search for something like “best noise-canceling headphones” or “electronic gift ideas for a college student,” they will see a carousel of related products at the bottom of the results.

This carousel will feature products directly mentioned by users from conversations on related posts and comments. If users tap on the product, they can view more details and then be directed to the retailer to purchase the item.

“This feature surfaces top-recommended products directly from discussions, giving redditors instant information about any product,” the company wrote in a [blog post](https://redditinc.com/news/in-case-you-saw-it-we-are-testing-a-new-shopping-product-experience-in-search). “This test is designed to make Reddit easier to navigate while keeping community perspectives at the center of the experience. We’ll continue learning from how people use this new feature and refine the experience over time.”

While platforms like TikTok and Instagram have long integrated shopping features, Reddit is now looking to follow suit. Of course, Reddit isn’t the only tech platform that recently started exploring AI-driven shopping, as OpenAI’s ChatGPT rolled out an [“Instant Checkout”](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/openai-takes-on-google-amazon-with-new-agentic-shopping-system/) feature last September that lets users make Etsy and Shopify purchases within conversations.

Thursday’s announcement comes after [Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/reddit-looks-to-ai-search-as-its-next-big-opportunity/) during the company’s earnings release last week that the platforms’s AI search engine could be the next big opportunity for its business, not just in terms of product, but also as a revenue driver.

Huffman also noted that weekly active users for search grew 30% over the past year, increasing from 60 million to 80 million, while weekly active users for the AI-powered Reddit Answers feature rose from 1 million in the first quarter of 2025 to 15 million by the fourth quarter.
