    Xbox fans had been anticipating the retirement of Microsoft Gaming CEO **Phil Spencer** for years, but what most hadn’t expected was the departure of Xbox president **Sarah Bond** too. For many outside the company, Bond seemed like Spencer’s natural successor, a deputy of sorts.
    
    Microsoft CEO **Satya Nadella** and Microsoft CFO **Amy Hood** clearly didn’t agree.

    The big shakeup at Xbox means that [Asha Sharma](https://www.theverge.com/games/882326/read-microsoft-gaming-ceo-asha-sharma-first-memo) is taking over for [Phil Spencer](https://www.theverge.com/news/882241/microsoft-phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement) as CEO of Microsoft Gaming. Her previous role at Microsoft was AI-focused, and here’s what she has to say about utilizing AI for games:
    
    > As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.
