It seems so simple: Your phone has plenty of computing power, access to all your apps and data, an always-on connection. The only problem? Your phone's screen is too small for many tasks, and so is its keyboard. Or at least, they were, until foldable phones made it possible to carry a truly gigantic screen in your pocket.

For almost as long as phones have been around, people have wanted those phones to also be laptops. It seems so simple: Your phone has plenty of computing power, access to all your apps and data, an always-on connection. The only problem? Your phone’s screen is too small for many tasks, and so is its keyboard. Or at least, they were, until foldable phones made it possible to carry a truly gigantic screen in your pocket. Now all bets are off.

On [this episode of](https://pod.link/vergecast) _[The Vergecast](https://pod.link/vergecast)_, _The Verge_’s [Allison Johnson](https://www.theverge.com/authors/allison-johnson) explains how she [turned a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 into her on-the-go laptop.](https://www.theverge.com/tech/878485/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-travel-keyboard-logitech-laptop-replacement) It took a little work, and at least one new accessory, but she’s actually starting to leave her laptop home more often. There’s even a chance that Google’s Android team and app developers might start to make the system work even better.

After that, it’s time for an update on the world of sports streaming. _Sportico_’s [Jacob Feldman](https://www.sportico.com/author/jacob-feldman/) joins the show to talk about the whirring drones all over the Winter Olympics coverage, the boring (in a good way) Super Bowl we just had, YouTube’s increasing leverage over both the TV world and the sports world, and whether the Netflix / Paramount / Warner Bros. deal will change the streaming landscape. The good news is, sports streaming is better than ever. The bad news is, chaos reigns.

After that, David takes a question from the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com) about flip phones, AI, and whether one device can feel and work like two devices. The answer is yes, in theory, we think. But the software doesn’t work.
