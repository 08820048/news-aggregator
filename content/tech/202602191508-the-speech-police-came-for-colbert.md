Generally speaking, arcane and mostly unenforced FCC rules are not the province of late night talk shows. FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr seems intent on changing that, though; not long after causing a ruckus that briefly [took Jimmy Kimmel off the air](https://www.theverge.com/news/780471/disney-abc-jimmy-kimmel-live-charlie-kirk), his vague threats appear to have been enough to convince CBS to [tell Stephen Colbert not to air an interview](https://www.theverge.com/policy/880009/stephen-colbert-cbs-fcc-brendan-carr-talarico-interview). Which, of course, became a whole thing.

On [this episode of _The Vergecast_](https://pod.link/vergecast) (which we recorded and published a day early both because of the news and because Nilay has a vacation to go on), David and Nilay open the show with an extra-large installment of Brendan Carr is a Dummy. We talk through the timeline of the Colbert / CBS back-and-forth, once again attempt to explain [how the equal time rule actually works](https://publicknowledge.org/equal-time-unequal-enforcement-fcc-chair/), and wonder exactly how far Carr’s chilling effect will be allowed to go.

After that, we turn to some gadgets. Nilay has always wanted exactly the facial-recognition feature [Meta appears to be getting ready to launch](https://www.theverge.com/tech/878725/meta-facial-recognition-smart-glasses-name-tag-privacy-advoates) for its smart glasses, but we’re not sure it should exist. And it appears Meta knows that. Apple is also gearing up for potentially [a series of launches in early March](https://www.theverge.com/tech/879671/apple-special-experience-event-march-2026), which could include new iPads, new Macs, and more. It almost certainly won’t include any of the [AI gadgets Apple is reportedly working on](https://www.theverge.com/tech/880293/apple-ai-hardware-smart-glasses-pin-airpods), but we talk about those anyway.

Finally, in the lightning round, we discuss Tesla’s [rough self-driving record](https://www.theverge.com/transportation/880256/teslas-robotaxis-have-crashed-14-times-in-9-months), Samsung’s [next phones](https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/879652/samsung-galaxy-s26-privacy-display-ad-flex-magic-pixel), an astonishing [robovac security problem](https://www.theverge.com/tech/879088/dji-romo-hack-vulnerability-remote-control-camera-access-mqtt), and more.
