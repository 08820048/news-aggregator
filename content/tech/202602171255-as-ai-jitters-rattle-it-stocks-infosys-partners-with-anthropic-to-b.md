Indian IT giant Infosys said on Tuesday it has partnered with Anthropic to develop enterprise-grade AI agents, as automation driven by large language models reshapes the global IT services industry.

Under the partnership, Infosys plans to integrate Anthropic’s Claude models into its Topaz AI platform to build so-called “agentic” systems. The companies claim these agents will be able to autonomously handle complex enterprise workflows across industries such as banking, telecoms, and manufacturing. The tie-up was announced at India’s [AI Impact Summit](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/16/all-the-important-news-from-the-ongoing-india-ai-summit/) in New Delhi this week, which will see top executives from AI companies and Big Tech alike in attendance.

The deal comes amid fears that AI tools, especially those built by major AI labs like Anthropic and OpenAI, [will disrupt India’s heavily-staffed, $280 billion IT services industry](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-file-it-giants-face-heat-ai-disruption-2026-02-11/), raising questions about the future of labor-intensive outsourcing business models. Earlier this month, shares of Indian IT companies went into [freefall](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indian-tech-stocks-slump-anthropics-ai-tool-raises-global-staffing-concerns-2026-02-04/) after Anthropic launched a suite of enterprise AI tools that claimed to automate tasks across legal, sales, marketing and research roles.

The partnership would give Infosys, one of the world’s largest IT services businesses, access to Anthropic’s Claude models and developer tools for building AI agents tailored for large enterprises. Infosys said it would use Anthropic’s Claude Code to help write, test and debug code, and said it is already deploying the tool internally to build expertise that will be applied to client work.

Infosys also detailed how AI is contributing to its business: AI-related services generated revenue of ₹25 billion (around $275 million), or 5.5% of the company’s total revenue of ₹454.8 billion (about $5 billion) in the December quarter. Rival Tata Consultancy Services previously said its AI services generate about $1.8 billion annually, or around 6% of revenue.

For Anthropic, the partnership offers a route into heavily regulated enterprise sectors where deploying AI systems at scale requires industry expertise and governance capabilities.

“There’s a big gap between an AI model that works in a demo and one that works in a regulated industry,” said Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei. Infosys’ experience in sectors such as financial services, telecoms, and manufacturing helps bridge that gap, he said.

Anthropic this week also opened its [first India office in Bengaluru](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/anthropic-plans-to-open-india-office-eyes-tie-up-with-billionaire-ambani/), as it seeks to expand further into the country, which has grown into the company’s second-largest market. Anthropic said India now [accounts](https://www.anthropic.com/research/india-brief-economic-index) for about 6% of global Claude usage, second only to the U.S., and much of that activity is concentrated in programming.

Infosys did not disclose the timeline for deploying Claude-powered AI agents or the financial terms of the deal.

The partnership is similar to other moves by Indian IT services firms. [HCLTech and OpenAI](https://www.hcltech.com/press-releases/hcltech-and-openai-collaborate-drive-enterprise-scale-ai-adoption) last year partnered up to help enterprises deploy AI tools at scale.
