Snap has big plans to release the newest version of its AR glasses, Specs, later this year. Despite the strategic priority that the hardware product represents, the company recently shed one of the top executives tied to the project, reportedly over a dispute with Snap CEO Evan Spiegel.

The tech blog Sources [originally reported](https://x.com/alexeheath/status/2024340366582038960?s=20) that the company had recently lost Scott Myers, its SVP of Specs, over a supposed “blow-up” with Spiegel.

When reached for comment by TechCrunch, a Snap spokesperson said that Myers had “decided to step down from his role at Snap.” The statement thanked him for his contributions, and wished him “the best in his next chapter.” The spokesperson also disputed the “blow-up” characterization but wouldn’t reveal more about Myers’ departure.

The spokesperson added: “We can’t wait to bring Specs to the world later this year. We remain focused on disciplined execution and long-term value creation for our developer partners, community and shareholders.”

It’s unclear when exactly Myers left the company, or what the alleged “blow-up” might have entailed. When a user on X asked Sources author Alex Heath about the nature of the reported dispute, he replied that it was about “[strategy](https://x.com/alexeheath/status/2024344234636304493?s=20),” adding that he couldn’t reveal more.

Snap has teased the commercial release of Specs for quite a while and, in recent months, has signaled that it’s getting serious about the product’s launch. In January, the company [spun off the Specs team](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/snap-gets-serious-about-specs-spins-ar-glasses-into-standalone-company/) into its own distinct subsidiary, Specs Inc., saying that the move would allow for “greater operational focus and alignment.” 

Myers joined the Snap team in 2020 and, prior to that, held roles at SpaceX, Apple, and Nokia, according to [his LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-myers-7a63b22/) profile. In [an interview](https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/smart-glasses/exclusive-i-asked-snaps-hardware-chief-about-the-companys-next-gen-specs-heres-what-i-found-out) with Tom’s Guide last summer, Myers called the development process for Specs an “entirely new paradigm” but also discussed the tricky nature of getting its form factor just right. “I don’t want to see people wearing a wire coming out of the back of their head,” he quipped.
