Samsung’s annual Galaxy S-series reveal is later than usual this year, but we [finally have a confirmed date](https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-february-2026-next-ai-phone-makes-life-easier/?utm_source=pr_media&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=general) to circle on the calendar: [February 25th](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pi503_ItsI). And if you were hoping for major hardware upgrades from the company’s flagship phones, you probably shouldn’t hold your breath: [an extensive leak published by _WinFuture_](https://winfuture.de/news,156733.html) has seemingly confirmed that the S26 series will be a software-focused affair.

According to the leaked specs, the standard S26 will allegedly get a nominally larger battery — 4300mAh compared to 4000mAh — which is great news for the last “small” phone left standing. Once again, all three phones will lack built-in Qi2 magnets, outsourcing them to cases instead. Camera hardware looks to be much the same as last year, though the main and 5x telephoto lenses appear to have faster apertures. All things being equal, that would be a good thing for low-light photos. Storage and RAM configurations look similar to last year, with a minimum of 16GB of RAM across the line, though _WinFuture_ suggests that the cheaper 128GB version of the standard S26 may be going away.

We’ll find out in a couple of weeks just how accurate this leak is, but given the emphasis on Galaxy AI in the invitation graphics, I’m willing to bet it’s pretty much spot on.
