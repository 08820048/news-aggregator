Robert Playter, CEO of Boston Dynamics, announced on Tuesday that he is stepping down from his role effective immediately and leaving the company on February 27th, as previously reported by [A3](https://www.automate.org/robotics/industry-insights/boston-dynamics-ceo-robert-playter-steps-down). Under Playter’s leadership, Boston Dynamics navigated its way through an acquisition from Softbank that brought it to [Hyundai](https://bostondynamics.com/news/hyundai-motor-group-completes-acquisition-of-boston-dynamics-from-softbank/) in 2021, and it launched a new [all-electric version of its humanoid Atlas robot](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24133145/boston-dynamics-resurrects-atlas-humanoid-robot-electric-new) in 2024. Just a few days ago, the company [posted another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNorxwlZlFk) of its research Atlas robots attempting tumbling passes and outdoor runs as more enterprise-ready editions start to roll out.

Boston Dynamics announced at CES last month that Atlas robots will begin [working in Hyundai’s car plants](https://www.theverge.com/news/853973/hyundai-boston-dynamics-atlas-robot-factory-2028) starting in 2028, as the robotics field has become increasingly crowded by competitors like [Tesla](https://www.theverge.com/transportation/869746/tesla-optimus-gen-3-q1-2026-earnings) and Figure, as well as AI companies with “[world model](https://www.theverge.com/column/801370/ai-world-models-general-intuition-medal)” tech built for robots.

Playter has been at Boston Dynamics for over 30 years and has served as CEO since 2020, [replacing the company’s original CEO, Marc Raibert](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/23/21078295/boston-dynamic-spot-robot-ceo-marc-raibert-replaced-sdk-conference). Boston Dynamics CFO Amanda McMaster will serve as interim CEO while the company’s board of directors searches for Playter’s replacement.

“Boston Dynamics has been the ride of a lifetime. What this place has become has exceeded anything I could have ever imagined all those years ago in our funky lab in the basement of the MIT Media Lab,” Playter said in a letter to employees, which was shared with _The Verge_. He also highlighted the company’s successes with its Spot, Stretch, and Atlas robots.

“From the earliest days of hopping robots, to the world’s first quadrupeds, to spearheading the entire humanoid industry, Playter made his mark as a pioneer of innovation. He transformed Boston Dynamics from a small research and development lab into a successful business that now proudly calls itself the global leader in mobile robotics,” Nikolas Noel, VP of marketing and communications at Boston Dynamics, said in a statement to _The Verge_, adding, “He will be sorely missed, but we hope he enjoys some well-deserved time off. Thanks Rob.”
