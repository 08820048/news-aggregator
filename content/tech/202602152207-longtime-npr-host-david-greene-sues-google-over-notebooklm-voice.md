David Greene, the longtime host of NPR’s “Morning Edition,” is suing Google, alleging that the male podcast voice in the company’s [NotebookLM tool](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/29/googles-notebooklm-expands-its-ai-podcast-feature-to-more-languages/) is based on Greene, [according to The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2026/02/15/david-greene-google-ai-podcast/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzcxMTMxNjAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzcyNTEzOTk5LCJpYXQiOjE3NzExMzE2MDAsImp0aSI6ImJmOTczZThmLTk3ZWMtNDEyOS04NzA2LTRkNTE4ZjY1N2EwMyIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjYvMDIvMTUvZGF2aWQtZ3JlZW5lLWdvb2dsZS1haS1wb2RjYXN0LyJ9._F1_6_Zr4YNbR60dRR6Yvqaz1cgpZ_fXcOfhVq6JjjY).

Greene said that after friends, family members, and coworkers began emailing him about the resemblance, he became convinced that the voice was replicating his cadence, intonation, and use of filler words like “uh.”

“My voice is, like, the most important part of who I am,” said Greene, who currently hosts [the KCRW show “Left, Right, & Center.”](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/381444881/k-c-r-w-s-left-right-center)

Among other features, Google’s NotebookLM allows users to [generate a podcast with AI hosts](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/29/googles-notebooklm-expands-its-ai-podcast-feature-to-more-languages/). A company spokesperson told the Post that the voice used in this product is unrelated to Greene’s: “The sound of the male voice in NotebookLM’s Audio Overviews is based on a paid professional actor Google hired.”

This isn’t the first dispute over AI voices resembling real people. In one notable example, OpenAI removed a ChatGPT voice after [actress Scarlett Johansson complained](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/20/scarlett-johansson-says-that-openai-approached-her-to-use-her-voice/) that it was an imitation of her own.
