Snapchat [announced](https://newsroom.snap.com/first-ever-snappys-awards) on Wednesday that it’s hosting its first-ever awards show on March 21. The social media giant says the awards show, called “The Snappys,” is designed to celebrate “the creators shaping culture on Snapchat.”

Creators will receive awards like “Spotlight MVP,” “Best Storyteller,” and “Breakout Creator of the Year,” alongside awards across fashion, beauty, sports, music, food, and games. Additional categories include collaboration, comedy, and cultural impact.

“Together, these honors reflect the many ways creators spark conversations, build community, and define culture on Snapchat,” the company wrote in a [blog post](https://newsroom.snap.com/first-ever-snappys-awards). “The Snappys reinforces Snapchat’s ongoing commitment to celebrating creators not just as users, but as artists, entertainers, and cultural leaders.”

Snapchat is the latest social media platform to launch awards for creators. Meta-owned Instagram [introduced a new “Ring” award](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/instagram-introduces-new-ring-award-for-top-creators/) last October to recognize creators around the world. Instagram announced the 25 winners online, and each winner received a physical custom ring designed by English fashion designer Grace Wales Bonner, along with a digital golden ring around their Instagram profile.

In November, TikTok launched its first-ever [TikTok Awards show](https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/03/tiktok-announces-its-first-awards-show-in-the-us/) in the U.S. Like Snapchat, Instagram handed out category-specific awards, like “Creator of the Year,” “Video of the Year,” “Muse of the Year,” “Breakthrough Artist of the Year,” and more. It’s worth noting that TikTok has also hosted awards shows in other countries, including Germany, Mexico, and Korea.

Snapchat’s awards are more in line with TikTok’s, as it will also host a traditional awards show where the winners will be revealed live at the event. The company says the show will bring together “creators, industry leaders, and special guests.” One of the “special guests” is DJ Khaled, who will be receiving Snapchat’s “Lifetime Achievement Award.”

By launching awards, Snapchat and its rivals are positioning themselves as more than just social media apps and as notable players in the entertainment industry.
