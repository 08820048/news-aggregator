summary: "In September, Apple launched its latest batch of smartwatches, including the Apple Watch Series 11, the SE 3, and the Ultra 3. Each has its own pros and cons, but the introduction of Apple’s newest wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had. But with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, watchOS 26, launched in September on the Series 6 and newer models, leaving those with a Series 5 and older devices in the proverbial dust. Fortunately, picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a futureproof smartwatch with an updated design, a robust feature set, and plenty of sensors. Now, let’s get to the deals. Apple Watch Series 11 deals Apple Watch Series 11 (42mm, GPS) Where to Buy: $399 $369 at Amazon $399 $299 at Walmart $399 at Best Buy Apple Watch Series 11 (46mm, GPS) Where to Buy: $429 $329 at Amazon $429 $329 at Walmart $429 at Best Buy The new Apple Watch Series 11 is a fairly iterative update of the Series 10, meaning those who already own Apple’s last-gen flagship may not necessarily feel compelled to upgrade. That being said, the newest model does tout a more power-efficient 5G modem and a more scratch-resistant display, as well as an additional 6 hours of battery life over the Series 10. It’s also the slimmest Apple Watch to date and the first to offer FDA-cleared hypertension notifications out of the gate, which you can also now leverage on both the Series 9 and Ultra 2. If you’re looking to be an early adopter, however, you can pick up the Apple Watch Series 11 in the 42mm / GPS configuration at Walmart starting at $299 ($100 off), which remains the lowest price we’ve seen for the base model. If you prefer the larger 46mm / GPS model, it’s also on sale at Amazon and Walmart in select configurations, where you can grab it for an all-time low of $329 ($100 off). Read our full Apple Watch Series 11 review. Apple Watch Series 10 deals Apple Watch Series 10 (46mm, GPS) Where to Buy: $429 $229 at Walmart If you’re looking for a real deal — and you’re not particularly tempted by what the Series 11 offers — the Series 10 still holds its own. The last-gen smartwatch packs the same S10 SiP chip that’s in the Series 11, as well as support for fast-charging, a gorgeous wide-angle OLED display, and a design that’s still significantly slimmer and lighter than previous models. It also features both depth and water temperature sensors, along with an FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature and the aforementioned hypertension notifications, courtesy of watchOS 26. Thankfully, the Series 10 remains on sale at Walmart in the 46mm sizing with GPS starting at $229 ($200 off), which is easily one of the lowest prices we’ve seen on the larger configuration. Read our Apple Watch Series 10 review. Apple Watch SE 3 deals Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS) Where to Buy: $249 $219 at Amazon $249 at Best Buy $249 $219 at Walmart Apple Watch SE 3 (44mm, GPS) Where to Buy: $279 $249 at Amazon $279 $249 at Walmart $279 at Best Buy While the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 introduce a handful of iterative updates, the new Apple Watch SE 3 represents a significant upgrade over its 2022 predecessor. The entry-level watch features the same speedy S10 chip found in Apple’s flagship models, for one, letting you take advantage of Apple’s double tap feature, wrist flick gestures, and on-device Siri. The SE 3 also (finally) adds an always-on display, 5G connectivity, support for fast-charging, and audio playback so you can listen to music or podcasts directly from your wrist. On the health front, the SE 3 introduces a wrist-temperature sensor for retrospective ovulation tracking, along with breathing disturbance alerts, sleep apnea notifications, and a new Sleep Score that breaks down time spent in each stage. What you won’t find are the Series 11’s EKG functionality, blood oxygen monitoring, or hypertension notifications — those are exclusive to the Series and Ultra models. In terms of deals, the Apple Watch SE 3 is currently available at Amazon and Walmart in its 40mm base configuration with GPS for $219 ($30 off), which is about $20 shy of its lowest price to date. You can also pick up the larger 44mm model at Amazon and Walmart starting at $249, a $30 discount. Read our full Apple Watch SE 3 review. Apple Watch SE (second-gen) deals 2022 Apple Watch SE (44mm, GPS) Where to Buy: $279 $129 at Walmart If you don’t need the latest upgrades, the last-gen SE remains a solid buy if you can pick it up at a significant discount. It has the same chipset as the Series 8, which still holds up well, but has fewer sensors (meaning fewer features), no always-on display, and a slightly outdated design compared to Apple’s newer watches. Those omissions might take it out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you’re after. Right now, the best deal on the last-gen SE can be found at Walmart, where you can pick up the 44mm model with GPS starting at $129 ($150 off), which remains an all-time low. Read our Apple Watch SE (second-gen) review. Apple Watch Ultra 3 deals Apple Watch Ultra 3 Where to Buy: $799 $768 at Amazon (with Ocean Band) $799 $768 at Amazon (with Alpine Loop) $799 $768 at Amazon (with Trail Loop) Unsurprisingly, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 offers the most features, sensors, and ruggedness of any Apple Watch available thus far. It features a larger, wide-angle OLED display with a 1Hz refresh rate and thinner bezels, as well as both satellite and 5G connectivity. Better yet, battery life has been extended from 36 hours to 42 hours — a marginal improvement, but one that allows you to squeeze out a bit more life when necessary. As far as deals are concerned, the Ultra 3 recently dropped to an all-time low of $699.99 ($100 off). That said, it’s currently only available at Amazon with either an Ocean Band, a Trail Loop, or an Alpine Loop starting at $768 ($31 off). Read our full Apple Watch Ultra 3 review. Apple Watch Ultra 2 deals Apple Watch Ultra 2 Where to Buy: $799 $549 at Best Buy (with Trail Loop) $799 $549 at Best Buy (with Alpine Loop) $799 $549 at Best Buy (with Ocean Band) If the latest Ultra isn’t what you’re after, you can save some money by opting for an Apple Watch Ultra 2, which isn’t vastly different than Apple’s latest top-of-the-line model. The wearable runs on the older S9 SiP and features Apple’s second-gen ultra wideband chip, but that may not matter to you since it still offers precise GPS tracking, a range of diving-friendly sensors, and long-lasting battery life. Right now, you can pick up the Apple Watch Ultra 2 at Best Buy with an Alpine Loop, a Trail Loop, or an Ocean Band starting at $549 ($250 off), which matches its lowest price to date.

If you don’t need the latest upgrades, the last-gen SE remains a solid buy if you can pick it up at a significant discount. It has the same chipset as the Series 8, which still holds up well, but has fewer sensors (meaning fewer features), no always-on display, and a slightly outdated design compared to Apple’s newer watches. Those omissions might take it out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you’re after.

Right now, the best deal on the last-gen SE can be found at [](https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Starlight-Aluminum-Case-with-Starlight-Sport-Band-S-M%2F11451100677)[Walmart](https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Starlight-Aluminum-Case-with-Starlight-Sport-Band-S-M%2F11451100677), where you can pick up the 44mm model with GPS starting at $129 ($150 off), which remains an all-time low.

$768

Unsurprisingly, the [Apple Watch Ultra 3](https://www.theverge.com/news/770763/apple-watch-ultra-3-awe-dropping-event) offers the most features, sensors, and ruggedness of any Apple Watch available thus far. It features a larger, wide-angle OLED display with a 1Hz refresh rate and thinner bezels, as well as both satellite and 5G connectivity. Better yet, battery life has been extended from 36 hours to 42 hours — a marginal improvement, but one that allows you to squeeze out a bit more life when necessary.

As far as deals are concerned, the Ultra 3 recently dropped to an all-time low of $699.99 ($100 off). That said, it’s currently only available at Amazon with either [an Ocean Band](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Multisport-Smartwatch-Satellite-Communications/dp/B0FQG8X3RH/?tag=theverge02-20), [a Trail Loop](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Multisport-Smartwatch-Satellite-Communications/dp/B0FQFMC57X/?tag=theverge02-20), or [an Alpine Loop](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Multisport-Smartwatch-Satellite-Communications/dp/B0FQFTSWFM/?tag=theverge02-20) starting at $768 ($31 off).

$549

If the latest Ultra isn’t what you’re after, you can save some money by opting for an Apple Watch Ultra 2, which isn’t vastly different than Apple’s latest top-of-the-line model. The wearable runs on the older S9 SiP and features Apple’s second-gen ultra wideband chip, but that may not matter to you since it still offers precise GPS tracking, a range of diving-friendly sensors, and long-lasting battery life.

Right now, you can pick up the Apple Watch Ultra 2 at Best Buy with [an Alpine Loop](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fapple-watch-ultra-2-gps-cellular-49mm-titanium-case-with-dark-green-alpine-loop-medium-black-2024%2FJJGCQ3FY6H), [a Trail Loop](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fapple-watch-ultra-2-gps-cellular-49mm-titanium-case-with-black-trail-loop-s-m-black-2024%2FJJGCQ3FPZX), or [an Ocean Band](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fapple-watch-ultra-2-gps-cellular-49mm-titanium-case-with-black-ocean-band-black-2024%2FJJGCQ3FLGQ) starting at $549 ($250 off), which matches its lowest price to date.
