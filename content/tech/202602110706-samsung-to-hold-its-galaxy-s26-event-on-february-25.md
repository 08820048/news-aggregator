Lee, de facto chief of South Korean conglomerate, faces five charges connecting the bribery scandal involving ousted former President Park Geun-hye and her confidant Choi Soon-sil. The verdict affects the business of Samsung, which has launched new Galaxy Note 8 smartphone to wipe out the misery of exploding Note 7 last year.

Samsung sent out invites Tuesday to its next Galaxy Unpacked event, scheduled for February 25 in San Francisco, where the company is expected to launch its Galaxy 26 series of smartphones.

AI features will be at the forefront again, as the company said the upcoming phones are “built to simplify everyday interactions, inspire confidence and make Galaxy AI feel seamlessly integrated from the moment it’s in hand.”

A standout feature the company has teased is [a privacy display](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/samsung-teases-new-privacy-feature-to-hide-your-galaxy-phone-screen-from-onlookers/) expected to debut on the Galaxy S26 Ultra.This feature will allow users to hide certain areas of the phone’s screen from onlookers to protect sensitive information. For instance, users will be able to hide the notification area from prying eyes.

[Reports](https://www.cnet.com/news-live/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2026/) suggest that the top phone in the lineup will run Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon Elite Gen 5 processor in the U.S. and China. Samsung will likely opt for its own Exynos 2600 processor in other regions. The distinction matters, but increasingly less so. Snapdragon processors have historically outperformed Samsung’s Exynos chips in benchmarks and thermal efficiency, but the performance gap has been narrowing.

According to a report from the tech site [SamMobile](https://www.sammobile.com/news/exclusive-samsung-25w-wireless-charger-galaxy-s26-photos/?utm_source=relatednews), the S26 will also have a 5,100 mAh (milliamp-hour, a standard unit of battery capacity) battery and will support 60W wired charging along and 25W wireless charging.

In addition to phones, Samsung is likely to release updated Galaxy Buds 4 wireless earbuds. The company plans to update the design from the previous generation, which drew widespread comparisons to Apple’s AirPods.

The event will begin at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM ET/ 7 PM CET, and will be streamed live on [Samsung’s website](http://www.samsung.com/) and [its YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/l8iOk6kkuuQ).

Techcrunch event

Boston, MA | June 23, 2026

Samsung is offering a $30 promotional credit to anyone who [pre-registers interest](https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/the-next-galaxy/reserve/?r=true&referrer=usnewsroom) it its upcoming devices. Pre-registering is merely an expression of interest; consumers will still get the credit as a discount toward other Samsung products even if they don’t end up buying the new devices. If you pre-register and then pre-order one of the devices, the company will increase that to a $150 credit — no trade-in required.
