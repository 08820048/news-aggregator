summary: "Isaac 0 is a stationary robot with one job: folding laundry. | Image: Weave Robotics If you have a spare $7,999 (plus a $250 deposit), hate folding laundry, and happen to live in the Bay Area, one-and-a-half-year-old startup Weave has the robot for you: Isaac 0. It takes Isaac 0 around 30-90 minutes to fold a load of laundry, Weave says.

If you have a spare $7,999 (plus a $250 deposit), hate folding laundry, and happen to live in the Bay Area, one-and-a-half-year-old startup Weave has the robot for you: Isaac 0.

It takes Isaac 0 around 30-90 minutes to fold a load of laundry, Weave [says](https://www.weaverobotics.com/discover/isaac-0-announcement). That’s all it does — it’s stationary and needs a regular wall outlet — and it can’t tackle large blankets, bed sheets, or inside-out garments. It’s not fully autonomous either, with teleoperators on-hand to assist with trickier folds, though Weave says performance will improve over time.

Weave joins a growing list of companies working to build chore-eliminating robots in the hopes that people will welcome them into their homes. This year’s CES highlighted laundry as the ultimate use case, with demos from [LG’s CLOiD](https://www.theverge.com/tech/854082/lg-cloid-home-robot-fold-laundry-ces) and [SwitchBot’s Onero H1](https://www.theverge.com/news/852741/switchbot-onero-h1-humanoid-household-robot-ces-2026). Despite the hype, we’re not sure [if robots are ready for real homes just yet](https://www.theverge.com/featured-video/860104/we-tried-to-get-humanoid-robots-to-do-the-laundry).
