On Friday afternoon, Donald Trump [posted on Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116144552969293195), accusing Anthropic, the AI company behind Claude, of attempting to “STRONG-ARM” the Pentagon and directing federal agencies to “IMMEDIATELY CEASE” use of its products. At issue is Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s [refusal](https://www.theverge.com/news/885773/anthropic-department-of-defense-dod-pentagon-refusal-terms-hegseth-dario-amodei) of an updated agreement with the US military agreeing to “any lawful use” of Anthropic’s technology, as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth mandated in a January memo, to the frustration of many tech workers [across the industry](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/885963/anthropic-dod-pentagon-tech-workers-ai-labs-react).

As we explained [earlier this week](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/883456/anthropic-pentagon-department-of-defense-negotiations), that agreement would give the US military access to use the company’s services for mass domestic surveillance and lethal autonomous weapons, or AI that has full power to track and kill targets with no humans involved in the decision-making process. OpenAI and xAI have [reportedly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2026/02/22/pentagon-anthropic-ai-dispute/) already agreed to the new terms, though OpenAI is [reportedly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2026/02/22/pentagon-anthropic-ai-dispute/) looking to negotiate with the Pentagon to adopt the same red lines as Anthropic.

For weeks, Anthropic and the Pentagon have been locked in a stalemate regarding the acceptable use of Anthropic’s AI technology. But negotiations with Anthropic had stalled after a [dramatic exchange](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/883456/anthropic-pentagon-department-of-defense-negotiations) of public statements and social media posts.

In a [statement](https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-department-of-war) Thursday, Amodei wrote that the Pentagon’s “threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request.” He added that Anthropic has “never raised objections to particular military operations nor attempted to limit use of our technology in an ad hoc manner” but that in a “narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values.”

Amodei went on to say that “should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military planning, operations, or other critical missions. Our models will be available on the expansive terms we have proposed for as long as required.”

Now we have Trump’s response:

> THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL NEVER ALLOW A RADICAL LEFT, WOKE COMPANY TO DICTATE HOW OUR GREAT MILITARY FIGHTS AND WINS WARS! That decision belongs to YOUR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, and the tremendous leaders I appoint to run our Military.
> 
> The Leftwing nut jobs at Anthropic have made a DISASTROUS MISTAKE trying to STRONG-ARM the Department of War, and force them to obey their Terms of Service instead of our Constitution. Their selfishness is putting AMERICAN LIVES at risk, our Troops in danger, and our National Security in JEOPARDY.
> 
> Therefore, I am directing EVERY Federal Agency in the United States Government to IMMEDIATELY CEASE all use of Anthropic’s technology. We don’t need it, we don’t want it, and will not do business with them again! There will be a Six Month phase out period for Agencies like the Department of War who are using Anthropic’s products, at various levels. Anthropic better get their act together, and be helpful during this phase out period, or I will use the Full Power of the Presidency to make them comply, with major civil and criminal consequences to follow.
> 
> WE will decide the fate of our Country — NOT some out-of-control, Radical Left AI company run by people who have no idea what the real World is all about. Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
