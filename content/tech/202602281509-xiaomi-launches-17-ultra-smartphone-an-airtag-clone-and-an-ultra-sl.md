Xiaomi today launched a slew of gadgets ahead of the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona including a camera-focused flagship smartphone, an AirTag clone, Xiaomi Watch 5 smartwatch, and an ultra slim power bank.

The China-based company has partnered with camera maker Leica to co-brand its Xiaomi 17 Ultra smartphone. As part of the partnership, it is using Leica lenses and creating filters in the style of the German camera company.

The phone has a 50-megapixel main sensor with an F/1.67 aperture and a 1-inch sensor. But the main attraction is the 200-megapixel telephoto camera that has a variable focal length of 75mm-100mm equivalent. That means you can zoom optically between 3.2x and 4.3x. The phone also has a 50 MP ultrawide camera with an f/2.2 aperture.

The device has a 6.9-inch Xiaomi HyperRGB OLED display protected by Xiaomi’s own Shield Glass 3.0. The company has picked Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 processor, which was also used in the recently launched Galaxy S26 series.

The company is also releasing a special Leica edition phone to celebrate 100 years of the camera company. The device has a durable aluminum-alloy body with a nickel-anodized finish. Xiaomi has also added a Leica theme on the software side.
