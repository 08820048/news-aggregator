Former GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke has raised the largest-ever seed round for a dev tool startup, according to its lead backer, Felicis. The startup, [Entire](http://entire.io/), has raised $60 million at a $300 million valuation.

Entire offers an open source tool to help developers better manage code written by AI agents.

Entire’s tech has three components. One is a Git-compatible database to unify the AI-produced code. Git is a distributed version control system popular with enterprises and used by open source sites like GitHub and GitLab.

Another component is what it calls “a universal semantic reasoning layer” intended to allow multiple AI agents to work together. The final piece is an AI-native user interface designed with agent-to-human collaboration in mind.

The first product Entire is releasing is an open source tool it calls Checkpoints that automatically pairs every bit of software the agent submits for use in a software project with the context that created it, including prompts and transcripts. The idea is to allow the human developer to review, search, and perhaps even learn from why the AI did what it did.

Entire hopes to help developers better deal with the large volumes of software created by AI coding agents. Popular open source projects are [particularly overwhelmed these days with suggested code contributions](https://www.infoworld.com/article/4129056/is-ai-killing-open-source.html) that may or may not be AI slop — meaning poorly designed and possibly unusable code.

Dohmke explains in the press release: “We are living through an agent boom, and now massive volumes of code are being generated faster than any human could reasonably understand. The truth is, our manual system of software production — from issues, to git repositories, to pull requests, to deployment — was never designed for the era of AI in the first place.”

Dohmke was CEO of Microsoft’s GitHub for four years, leaving in August 2025 to found a startup, he said in a [post](https://x.com/ashtom/status/1954920157853172064) on X at the time. During his time there, he oversaw the rise of the popular coding agent GitHub Copilot.

Other investors in the seed round include Madrona, M12, Basis Set, Harry Stebbings, Jerry Yang, and Datadog founder and CEO Olivier Pomel.
