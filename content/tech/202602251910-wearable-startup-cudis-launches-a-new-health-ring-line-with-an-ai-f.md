Wearables startup [CUDIS](https://shop.cudis.xyz/) is launching its newest series of health rings this week. The updated ring comes equipped with a number of features, including an AI “agent coach” designed to keep users on track to attain their fitness goals.

CUDIS says it differentiates itself from other wearables by not just delivering health metrics but also incentivizing healthy behavior through a points system. Users garner digital “health points” for healthy behaviors — things like daily sleep, 10,000 steps every day, sports activities, and conversations with the ring’s AI coach — which can then be redeemed through an integrated marketplace for discounts on health supplements and other products.

The ring’s AI Agent Coach, meanwhile, is designed to leverage generative AI to aid with healthy programs for exercise and daily health. The company says that its agent generates tailored programs including “daily tasks, recovery protocols, supplement recommendations, and direct referrals to licensed medical professionals.”

The ring also tracks a host of body metrics and daily behaviors, such as sleep quality, stress management, movement, and recovery. This helps them see how these metrics affect their Pace of Aging (PoA), showing whether their body is aging faster or slower than their chronological age, the company explains.

CUDIS CEO and co-founder Edison Chen told TechCrunch that since his company’s first wearable was launched in 2024, the company has sold over 30,000 units across its first two models. The app’s user base has also grown to 250,000 users across 103 countries, he added.

“Our strongest markets so far have been North America, Europe, and Asia,” Chen said. “What we’re good at is pattern recognition for healthy people trying to optimize,” Chen told TechCrunch.

“The AI spots when you’re trending in the wrong direction, such as chronic poor sleep, declining HRV, elevated resting heart rate, and either suggests lifestyle changes or connects you to a professional. The control is in the escalation pathway to the right care access,” he said.

The company claims that it keeps user data encrypted and secure via the Solana blockchain. It has previously [been described](https://shop.cudis.xyz/blogs/news/smarter-rings-and-things-7-ways-to-wear-ai) as a “web3 AI wellness company.” (TechCrunch was not able to test the smart ring directly to verify its security claims.)

CUDIS announced $5 million of seed funding in 2024. The round was led by Draper Associates and included a number of other investors, including a number of blockchain-associated investor groups like Skybridge, DraperDragon, Monke Ventures, and Foresight Ventures, among others. The company also [plans to launch](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cudis/cudis-sporty-ring-1st-smart-ring-you-can-style-and-earn-with) a Kickstarter soon.
