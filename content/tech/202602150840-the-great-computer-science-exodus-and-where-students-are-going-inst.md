Something strange happened at University of California campuses this fall. For the first time since the dot-com crash, computer science enrollment dropped. System-wide, it fell [6% this year](https://www.sfchronicle.com/college-admissions/article/uc-major-computer-science-ai-21284464.php) after declining 3% in 2024, according to reporting this past week by the San Francisco Chronicle. Even as overall college enrollment [climbed 2% nationally](https://nscresearchcenter.org/final-fall-enrollment-trends/) — according to January data from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center — students are bailing on traditional CS degrees.

The one exception is UC San Diego — the only UC campus that added a [dedicated AI major this fall](https://today.ucsd.edu/story/uc-san-diegos-new-ai-major-is-here).

This all might look like a temporary blip tied to news about fewer CS grads [finding work out of college](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/10/the-computer-science-dream-has-become-a-nightmare/). But it’s more likely an indicator of the future, one that China is much more enthusiastically embracing. As MIT Technology Review [reported last July](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/28/1120747/chinese-universities-ai-use/), Chinese universities have leaned hard into AI literacy, treating AI not as a threat but instead as essential infrastructure. Nearly 60% of Chinese students and faculty now use AI tools multiple times daily, and schools like Zhejiang University have made AI coursework mandatory, while top institutions like Tsinghua have created entirely new interdisciplinary AI colleges. In China, fluency with AI isn’t optional anymore; it’s table stakes.

U.S. universities are scrambling to catch up. Over the last two years, dozens have launched AI-specific programs. MIT’s “AI and decision-making” major is now the [second-largest major](https://capd.mit.edu/blog/2025/12/04/mits-aid-major-becomes-one-of-the-institutes-most-popular-undergraduate-programs/) on campus, says the school. As reported by the New York Times in December, the University of South Florida enrolled more than [3,000 students](http://This semester, more than 3,000 students enrolled in a new college of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity at the University of South Florida in Tampa) in a [new AI and cybersecurity college](https://crowsneststpete.com/2025/09/29/usfs-bellini-college-launch-attracts-students-to-ai-and-cybersecurity-research/#:~:text=The%20college's%20goals%20include:%20*%20Improving%20the,college%20on%20the%20Tampa%20campus%20by%202028.) during its fall semester. The University at Buffalo [last summer](https://hesc.ny.gov/about/news-releases/governor-hochul-announces-first-their-kind-ai-specialized-degrees-offered) launched a new “AI and Society” department that offers seven new, specialized undergraduate degree programs, and it received [more than 200 applicants](https://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2025/12/University-at-Buffalo-solidifies-leadership-AI-data-science.html) before it swung open its doors.

The transition hasn’t been smooth everywhere. When I spoke with [UNC Chapel Hill Chancellor Lee Roberts](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/the-man-betting-everything-on-ai-and-bill-belichick/) in October, he described a spectrum — some faculty “leaning forward” with AI, others with “their heads in the sand.” Roberts, a former finance executive who arrived from outside academia, was pushing hard for AI integration despite faculty resistance. A week earlier, UNC had announced it would [merge two schools](https://www.unc.edu/posts/2025/10/09/development-of-a-new-school-at-carolina/) to create an AI-focused entity — a decision that drew faculty pushback. Roberts had also appointed a vice provost specifically for AI. “No one’s going to say to students after they graduate, ‘Do the best job you can, but if you use AI, you’ll be in trouble,’” Roberts told me. “Yet we have faculty members effectively saying that right now.”

Parents are playing a role in this rocky transition, too. David Reynaldo, who runs the admissions consultancy College Zoom, told the Chronicle that parents who once pushed kids toward CS are now reflexively steering them toward other majors that seem more resistant to AI automation, including mechanical and electrical engineering.

But the enrollment numbers suggest students are voting with their feet. According to a [survey](https://cra.org/crn/2025/10/cerp-pulse-survey-a-snapshot-of-2025-undergraduate-computing-enrollment-patterns/) in October by the nonprofit Computing Research Association — it members include computer science and computer engineering departments from a wide range of universities — 62% of respondents reported that their computing programs saw undergraduate enrollment declines this fall. But with AI programs ballooning, it’s looking less like a tech exodus and more like a migration. The University of Southern California is [launching an AI degree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkj7qOeSte4#) this coming fall; so are [Columbia University](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/about/news/columbia-engineering-announces-new-program-master-science-artificial-intelligence#:~:text=The%20mix%20of%20backgrounds%20will,success%20in%20their%20chosen%20field.%E2%80%9D), [Pace University](https://www.pace.edu/news/press-release-pace-university-launch-bachelor-of-science-artificial-intelligence-fall-2026), and [New Mexico State University](https://newsroom.nmsu.edu/news/nmsu-introduces-new-institute--degrees-in-artificial-intelligence/s/57adb5a5-de63-4659-8daa-fb7759372e5b), among many others. Students aren’t abandoning tech; they’re choosing programs focused on AI instead.

It’s too soon to say whether this recalibration is permanent or a temporary panic. But it’s certainly a wake-up call for administrators who’ve spent years wrestling with how to handle AI in the classroom. The debate over whether to ban ChatGPT is ancient history at this point. The question now is whether American universities can move fast enough or whether they’ll keep arguing about what to do while students transfer to schools that already have answers.
