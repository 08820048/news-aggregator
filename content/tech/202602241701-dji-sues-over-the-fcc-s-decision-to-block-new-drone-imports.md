DJI wants a federal court to toss out the Federal Communications Commission’s decision to ban imports of its China-made drones and components, [as reported earlier by _Reuters_](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/chinese-dronemaker-dji-files-lawsuit-challenge-us-import-ban-new-models-2026-02-24/). In [a petition filed](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/27359395-dji-vs-fcc/) in an appeals court this week, DJI claims the FCC “exceeded its statutory authority” last December when [adding drones](https://www.theverge.com/news/849460/fcc-foreign-drone-ban-dji-congress-deadline) made in foreign countries to its Covered List, which blocks communications equipment “deemed to pose an unacceptable risk” to national security.

In addition to preventing DJI and other foreign dronemakers from importing new drones in the US (unless approved by the Department of Defense), the FCC also [gave itself the authority to retroactively block](https://www.theverge.com/report/808104/fcc-order-retroactive-ban-transmitter-national-security) equipment that it previously permitted, setting the stage for a broader drone crackdown. DJI alleges that the FCC’s move has “severely” harmed its company, and also accuses the agency of violating the Fifth Amendment. DJI asks the court to vacate and enjoin the FCC’s decision, and deem it unlawful.

“It carelessly restricts DJI’s business in the U.S. and summarily denies U.S. customers access to its latest technology,” DJI says in a statement to _Reuters_. DJI didn’t immediately respond to _The Verge_’s request for comment.
