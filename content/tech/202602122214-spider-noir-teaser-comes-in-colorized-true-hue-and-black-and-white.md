The footage was shot digitally and processed separately to create the black-and-white and color versions. The team coined the term “True Hue” for the latter, since the intent was to create something that looked supersaturated, like classic Technicolor. (Cage compared the feel to the 1944 Edward Hopper painting _Nighthawks_.) Per the official premise: “_Spider-Noir_ tells the story of Ben Reilly (Nicolas Cage), a seasoned, down on his luck private investigator in 1930s New York, who is forced to grapple with his past life, following a deeply personal tragedy, as the city’s one and only superhero.”

In addition to Cage’s Ben Reilly/The Spider, the cast includes Lamorne Morris as Reilly’s friend Robbie Robertson, a freelance journalist who clings to optimism in the face of his buddy’s cynicism; Li Jun Li as nightclub singer Cat Hardy, the classic underworld femme fatale (Li based her portrayal on Anna May Wong, Rita Hayworth, and Lauren Bacall); Karen Rodriguez as Reilly’s secretary, Janet; Abraham Popoola as a World War I veteran; Jack Huston as a bodyguard named Flint Marko; Brendan Gleeson as New York mob boss Silvermane, who is being targeted for assassination; Lukas Haas as one of Silvermane’s subordinates; Richard Robichaux as the editor of the Daily Bugle; and Kai Caster.

Frankly, we’re digging the black and white, but here’s the True Hue color version of the teaser for good measure:

_Spider-Noir_ premieres on May 25, 2026, on MGM+, with all episodes becoming available on Prime Video on May 27, 2026. Viewers can choose to watch in black and white or True Hue.
