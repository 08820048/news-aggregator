YouTube is expanding its more affordable, $7.99 per month Premium Lite subscription service with new features, including the ability to download videos for offline access and watch videos in the background, even if the screen is off or you’re using other apps. These options were previously only available to customers on its [full plan](http://youtube.com/premium), which costs $13.99 per month.

The company said the additions were the result of user feedback, as customers in its pilot program shared that they wanted these specific features to make the subscription more attractive.

[Launched last March](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/05/youtube-launches-a-7-99-per-month-ad-free-premium-lite-subscription/), YouTube Premium Lite introduced a more modestly priced subscription tier that would remove ads from “most” videos on the platform, including those across popular verticals like gaming, fashion, beauty, cooking, news, and more. However, ads would continue to be shown on music content and music videos. Plus, customers on the Lite plan won’t have access to the ad-free YouTube Music app.

With the arrival of these new features, ad-free music content will now be the only reason to upgrade to the full Premium subscription. It will also likely make the Lite tier more attractive to customers who didn’t want to pay just for ad-free content but wanted other upgrades as well.

The Lite subscription tier was first introduced in Thailand, Germany, and Australia, before [coming to the U.S.](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/introducing-premium-lite/) last year. It’s now available across a number of [other global markets](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6307365?sjid=3191540551318705081-NA#zippy=%2Cpremium-lite-memberships-available-locations), including Canada, Brazil, the U.K., India, Mexico, and other parts of Europe and Asia.

YouTube’s subscription business has been steadily growing. Combined with ads, YouTube’s overall revenue reached $60 billion in 2025, according to information shared by parent company Alphabet earlier this month [during Q4 earnings](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/googles-subscriptions-rise-in-q4-as-youtube-pulls-60b-in-yearly-revenue/).

The company also reported that YouTube’s ad revenue increased 9% to $11.38 billion in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, the “subscriptions, platforms and devices” group’s revenue increased 17% to $13.6 billion in Q4, which the company attributed to strong growth in YouTube subscriptions, particularly YouTube Music and YouTube Premium.

Alphabet reported more than 125 million YouTube Music and YouTube Premium users worldwide in March 2025. The company didn’t share an updated metric during its Q4 earnings earlier this month but said that it now has more than 325 million paid subscriptions across consumer services, including YouTube Premium and others, like Google One.
