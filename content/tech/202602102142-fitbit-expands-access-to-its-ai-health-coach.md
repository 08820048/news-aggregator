Google announced on Tuesday that the public preview of Fitbit’s AI personal health coach is [rolling out to iOS users](https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/devices/fitbit/personal-health-coach-expansion/) in the U.S. as well as both iOS and Android users in the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore. It [initially launched in October](https://www.theverge.com/tech/806243/fitbit-ai-health-coach-app-update-preview), when it was only available in the U.S. on Android devices.

To try out the feature, users need to have an active Fitbit Premium subscription and [use a Google account](https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/871218/fitbit-account-migration-google-deadline-may-2026) to sign into the Fitbit app. They also need to use one of the 14 [currently-supported devices](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/16678124#supportedcountryanddevice&zippy=%2Csupported-countries-and-devices), which include Fitbit’s wearables, as well as the Pixel Watch. According to [Fitbit](https://community.fitbit.com/t5/The-Pulse-Fitbit-Community-Blog/Fitbit-s-Personal-health-coach-is-now-available-for-iOS-Premium-users/ba-p/5811766), the AI health coach will be rolling out “over the next few days,” so it may not be available to all eligible users immediately.

The update is a [major overhaul of Fitbit’s app](https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/761965/fitbits-ai-health-coach-is-the-first-i-might-actually-be-interested-in), introducing the ability to chat with a Gemini-powered AI that creates custom routines and workouts based on users’ personal health goals, workout equipment, and training preferences.
