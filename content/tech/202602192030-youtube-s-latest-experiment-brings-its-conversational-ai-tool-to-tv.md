The race to advance conversational AI in the living room is heating up, with YouTube being the latest to expand its tool to smart TVs, gaming consoles, and streaming devices. 

This experimental feature, previously limited to mobile devices and the web, now brings conversational AI directly to the largest screen in the home, allowing users to ask questions about content without leaving the video they’re watching. 

According to YouTube’s [support page](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/18138167?hl=en&msgid=411145985), eligible users can click the “Ask” button on their TV screen to summon the AI assistant. The feature offers suggested questions based on the video, or users can use their remote’s microphone button to ask anything related to the video. For instance, they might ask about recipe ingredients or the background of a song’s lyrics, and receive instant answers without pausing or leaving the app. 

Currently, this feature is available to a select group of users over 18 and supports English, Hindi, Spanish, Portuguese, and Korean.

YouTube first launched this [conversational AI tool](https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/06/youtube-to-test-generative-ai-features-including-a-comments-summarizer-and-conversational-tool/) in 2024 to help viewers explore content in greater depth. The expansion to TVs comes as more Americans now access YouTube through their television than ever before. A [Nielsen report](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/27/youtube-tops-disney-and-netflix-in-tv-viewing-nielsen-finds/) from April 2025 found that YouTube accounted for 12.4% of total television audience time, surpassing major platforms like Disney and Netflix.

Other companies are also making significant strides with their conversational AI technologies. Amazon rolled out [Alexa+ on Fire TV devices](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/alexa-comes-to-new-fire-tv-devices-with-ai-powered-conversations/), enabling users to engage in natural conversations and ask Alexa+ for tailored content recommendations, hunt for specific scenes in movies, or even ask questions about actors and filming locations.

Meanwhile, [Roku](https://support.roku.com/article/208756908#section-5) has enhanced its AI voice assistant to handle open-ended questions about movies and shows, such as “What’s this movie about?” or “How scary is it?” [Netflix](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/netflix-debuts-its-generative-ai-powered-search-tool/) is also testing its AI search experience.

Another way YouTube has tried to improve its [TV experience with AI](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/youtubes-latest-updates-are-aimed-at-improving-the-tv-experience/) is the recent launch of a feature that automatically enhances videos uploaded at lower resolutions to full HD.

Additionally, the company continues to launch other AI features, like a comments summarizer that helps viewers catch up on video discussions and an [AI-driven search results carousel](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/youtube-adds-an-ai-overviews-like-search-results-carousel/). In January, the company [announced](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/youtube-will-soon-let-creators-make-shorts-with-their-own-ai-likeness/) that creators will soon be able to make Shorts using AI-generated versions of their own likeness. 

Last week, YouTube [launched](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/youtube-finally-launches-a-dedicated-app-for-apple-vision-pro/) a dedicated app for the Apple Vision Pro, too, letting users watch their favorite content on a theater-sized virtual screen in an immersive environment.
