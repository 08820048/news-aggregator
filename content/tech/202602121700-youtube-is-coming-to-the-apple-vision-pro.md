The Apple Vision Pro is finally getting [an official visionOS YouTube app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id6745572359) on Thursday. With the visionOS YouTube app, you’ll be able to watch all videos available on YouTube, including standard videos, Shorts, 3D, 360, and VR180 videos, Apple spokesperson Corey Nord tells _The Verge_.

The Vision Pro launched more than two years ago, but it hasn’t had an official YouTube app until now. Ahead of the release of the Vision Pro, YouTube said that it [wasn’t planning](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/18/24043540/youtube-spotify-apps-apple-vision-pro-visionos) to build a native app for the platform. But a few days after the headset hit store shelves, YouTube changed course and said that a Vision Pro app was [“on our roadmap.”](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/5/24062425/youtube-vision-pro-app-360-vr-video) That was in early February 2024, so it’s been just over two years from that announcement to Thursday’s launch.

Christian Selig, the developer of the [now-shut-down Apollo app for Reddit](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest), created an unofficial YouTube app for the Vision Pro [called Juno](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/2/24059005/juno-youtube-vision-pro-app-christian-selig) that was available when the Vision Pro was released. Apple removed it from the App Store [in October 2024](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259784/juno-youtube-apple-vision-pro-app-removed-christian-selig).
