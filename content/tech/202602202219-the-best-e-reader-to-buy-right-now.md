summary: "Any ebook reader will let you cram a Beauty and the Beast-sized library’s worth of books in your pocket, but so will your phone. An ebook reader offers a more book-like reading experience, with fewer distractions and less eye strain, and many include extra features, like adjustable frontlighting. Some really are pocketable. Others are waterproof or offer physical page-turning buttons, while a few even let you take notes. I’ve been using ebook readers for more than a decade, and I’ve gone hands-on with dozens, from the Kindle Paperwhite to lesser-known rivals like the PocketBook Era. Whether you want something your kid can throw against the wall or a waterproof, warm-glow Kindle that won’t ruin your spa ambiance, these are the best ebook readers for everyone. The best Kindle Kindle Paperwhite (2024) Score: 8 ProsCons The best-looking screen on any e-reader Slightly larger screen without a noticeably larger device Faster page turns, loading, and a more responsive UI A splash of color (without a color screen) Upgrades aren’t as significant as the last Paperwhite Lacks stylus support and page turn buttons Signature Edition wireless charging is frustrating without magnets Signature Edition back panel feels less grippy Where to Buy: $159.99 at Amazon (with ads) $159.99 at Best Buy (with ads) $159.99 at Target (without ads) Dimensions: 7 x 5 x .3 inches / Weight: 211 grams / Screen area and resolution: 7-inch screen, 300ppi resolution / Storage: 16GB / Other features: IPX8 waterproofing, Bluetooth audio support If you mostly buy ebooks from Amazon, you’ll want a Kindle, and the 12th-gen Kindle Paperwhite is the best choice for most people. It’s $70 cheaper than the Kobo Libra Colour — my top non-Amazon e-reader — yet offers many of the same features, including a spacious 7-inch 300pi display with rich contrast levels. Unlike Amazon’s entry-level Kindle, it also features IPX8 water resistance and an adjustable warm frontlight that reduces blue light, which can interrupt melatonin production. The $199.99 Signature Edition Paperwhite also supports wireless charging, a rare feature in an e-reader. Amazon dominates the US ebook market, so Kindle owners have access to advantages that owners of other ebook readers don’t. Much of Amazon’s hardware strategy depends on offering cut-rate discounts to pull you into its content ecosystem. If you have Prime and buy a lot of Kindle ebooks, the Paperwhite is the best choice because its ebooks and audiobooks are often on sale at Amazon, and Prime members get more free content through Prime Reading. Rivals like Kobo offer sales, too, but it’s hard for them to offer discounts as steep as Amazon. There are downsides, though. The Paperwhite includes lockscreen ads unless you pay $20 to remove them, and its size can make one-handed reading uncomfortable. More significantly, like all Kindles, it uses a proprietary format and doesn’t natively support EPUB, the open standard used by most other ebook stores. If you often shop from Kobo’s bookstore, Barnes & Noble, or Google Play Books, you’ll need to convert and transfer file formats in order to read them on a Kindle. If you mostly stick with Amazon, though, you’ll be more than happy with the Paperwhite. Read our full Kindle Paperwhite review. The best non-Amazon ebook reader Kobo Libra Colour (32GB, ad-free) ProsCons Nice color screen with sharp, 300ppi black-and-white resolution Physical page-turning buttons Built-in stylus support Compatible with Overdrive Getting books from other stores onto the device can be tough More expensive than the Kindle Paperwhite Lacks the vibrancy of other color e-readers No wireless charging Where to Buy: $229.99 at Amazon $229.99 at Rakuten Kobo $229.99 at Target Dimensions: 5.69 x 6.34 x 0.33 inches / Weight: 199.5 grams / Screen area and resolution: 7-inch screen, 300ppi (black-and-white), 150ppi (color) / Storage: 32GB / Other features: Physical page-turning buttons, waterproofing, Kobo Stylus 2 support, Bluetooth audio support The Kobo Libra Colour is a great alternative to Amazon’s ebook readers, particularly for readers outside the US or anyone who prefers not to buy into Amazon’s ecosystem. It offers many of the standout features found on the 12th-gen Paperwhite — including waterproofing, USB-C, and a 300ppi display — along with a few extra perks. Most notably, it uses E Ink’s latest Kaleido color technology, delivering soft, pastel-like hues that still pop in direct sunlight. Resolution drops to 150ppi when viewing color, but it still makes viewing a wider range of content more pleasant, even if images aren’t nearly as vivid as those on a traditional tablet or the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition. Unlike Amazon’s Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition, the Libra Colour also works with a stylus (sold separately), letting you highlight in multiple colors, annotate books, and use Kobo’s integrated notebooks. It borrows some more advanced tools from the Kobo Elipsa 2E, too, including handwriting-to-text conversion and math-solving, allowing it to double as a small digital notebook. It also includes physical page-turn buttons, lacks lockscreen ads, supports more file formats (including EPUB), and makes borrowing from OverDrive libraries relatively straightforward. A recent update even provides support for Instapaper, letting you save articles, blog posts, and other content for offline viewing. However, at $229.99, the Libra Colour costs $70 more than the entry-level Paperwhite — and that’s without Kobo’s $69.99 stylus, which is required to perform certain tasks. The gap widens further when the Paperwhite is on sale, which happens more frequently. The Libra Colour also can’t easily access Amazon’s ebook library, either, so longtime Kindle users may need third-party tools to convert their purchases. Still, if those things don’t matter or apply to you, the Libra Colour offers the most versatile and enjoyable reading experience of any e-reader on this list. It remains my personal favorite. Read our full Kobo Libra Colour review. The best cheap ebook reader Kindle (2024) ProsCons Excellent, high-resolution display Easy to hold with one hand Faster than its predecessor with improved battery life Fun color options No waterproofing Lacks adjustable color temperature Slightly more expensive than its predecessor Where to Buy: $109.99 at Amazon (with ads) $109.99 at Best Buy (with ads) $129.99 at Amazon (without ads) Dimensions: 6.2 x 4.3 x 0.32 inches / Weight: 158 grams / Screen area and resolution: 6-inch screen, 300ppi resolution / Storage: 16GB / Other features: USB-C support, Bluetooth audio support The base-model Kindle ($109.99 with ads) is the best cheap ebook reader. Its 300ppi resolution makes text clearer and easier to read than the lower-resolution screens on other ebook readers in its price range. Plus, it has USB-C for relatively fast charging. Reading on its six-inch screen feels a little more cramped than it does on the larger displays of the Kindle Paperwhite and Kobo Libra Colour. However, the flip side is that its small size makes it pocketable, light, and easy for small hands to hold. Combined with its relatively affordable price, the Kindle is also the best ebook reader for kids — especially the Amazon Kindle Kids Edition, which costs $20 more. The kid-friendly version shares the same specs but is ad-free with parental controls, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and a case. It also includes six months of Amazon Kids Plus, which grants kids access to thousands of children’s books and audiobooks for free. After that, though, you’ll have to pay $79 per year (or $48 with Amazon Prime). The base Kindle doesn’t have extra conveniences like the waterproofing, which you’ll find in the entry-level Kobo Clara BW and aforementioned Kindle Paperwhite. You also don’t get the physical page-turning buttons found on entry-level e-readers like Barnes & Noble’s Nook GlowLight 4e (though the Kindle is a lot snappier than the Nook). And because it’s an Amazon ebook reader, you’re also locked into the Amazon ecosystem and have to pay extra to remove ads. But if you can do without that, the Kindle delivers the essentials for under $110. The best ebook reader for taking notes Kobo Elipsa 2E ProsCons Intuitive note-taking features Great e-reader Adjustable warm light Useful note-taking capabilities, including handwriting-to-text conversion Lacks native support for Kindle books 227ppi display isn’t as sharp as the competition No note-summarization features Where to Buy: $399.99 at Walmart $399.99 at Target $399.99 at Amazon Dimensions: 7.6 x 8.94 x 0.30 inches / Weight: 390 grams / Screen area and resolution: 10.3-inches, 227ppi resolution / Storage: 32GB / Other features: Handwriting to text conversion, magnetic stylus, Bluetooth audio support Of all the large ebook readers I’ve tested, the Kobo Elipsa 2E stood out the most because it’s a good e-reader with solid note-taking abilities. You can write directly on pages just as in a physical book. The Kindle Scribe lets you annotate book pages as well, but it’s complicated, involving resizable text boxes that mess up the page formatting and prevent you from doing basic things like circling words. In contrast, taking notes on the Elipsa 2E feels far more intuitive and natural. The Elipsa 2E offers other helpful note-taking tools and capabilities. Like the Kobo Libra Colour, it’s capable, for example, of solving math equations for you. You can also insert diagrams and drawings, and it’ll automatically snap them into something that looks cleaner and nicer. You can also sync your notes with Dropbox or view them online and convert handwriting to typed text. The Kindle Scribe offers the latter capability, too, but again, Kobo does it faster and better within the original notebook document rather than on a separate page. The only thing missing from the Elipsa 2E is the Scribe’s note-summarization feature, but that’s a tradeoff I am okay with given how much easier it is to take notes. Note-taking capabilities aside, the Kobo Elipsa 2E is also a good e-reader with the same strengths and weaknesses as other Kobo devices. There’s support for a wide range of file formats, but you can’t easily read Kindle books without converting them first. Its 227ppi display is also slightly less sharp than the 300ppi screen found on the Kindle Scribe and the Kobo Libra Colour. However, the 10.3-inch screen balances things out a bit and makes text easier to read, so it’s not a noticeable drawback. Plus, the Elipsa 2E comes with an adjustable warm light for nighttime reading. That’s a feature rival e-readers with more advanced note-taking capabilities — including the $409.99 Onyx Boox Go 10.3, which lets you insert links to notes — lack. Other ebook readers we tested There are some other ebook readers my colleagues and I have tested that I didn’t feature above, but are still worth highlighting. Here are the most notable: Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition The Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition is the first Kindle to feature E Ink’s color screen technology, and it stands out from other color e-paper devices with customizations. It offers improved contrast, more vibrant colors, and faster screen refreshes. With a $279.99 price tag, it’s the most expensive Kindle model currently available that doesn’t support a stylus for note-taking, and it includes premium features like wireless charging that are convenient but not really necessary for a device with months of battery life. If you want a color screen and want to stick with Amazon, the Colorsoft Signature is your best option. – Andrew Liszewski, Senior Reporter Kindle Colorsoft Amazon recently introduced a more affordable alternative to the $279.99 Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition called the Kindle Colorsoft. It’s $30 cheaper and delivers a nearly identical reading experience, but lacks wireless charging and only offers 16GB of storage. That’s plenty of space for ebooks, but it might not be enough if you own a lot of graphic novels. The entry-level Kindle Colorsoft also supports Amazon’s new “Send to Alexa Plus” feature, which lets you send notes or documents to Amazon’s Alexa Plus assistant for summaries, to-do lists, reminders, or brainstorming. After a day of testing, I found it useful overall, though it sometimes lacked nuance. The biggest drawback for me, as a bedtime bookworm, is the lack of an auto-adjusting front light, which can make nighttime reading much easier (however, its brightness and color temperature can be manually adjusted). Given that the Colorsoft Signature Edition costs just $30 more, complete with a front light that adjusts when the room gets dim, 32GB of storage, and wireless charging, I’d opt for that instead if you’re in Amazon’s ecosystem. Unless the standard Colorsoft goes on sale for less, it’s not a great value at its regular price. Kobo Clara Colour If you’re looking for a non-Amazon alternative that’s more affordable than the Kobo Libra Colour, the Kobo Clara Colour — the successor to the Kobo Clara 2E — is worth a look. At $159.99, the ad-free e-reader costs more than the Kobo Clara 2E, but I think it’s worth the extra $10. It continues to offer the same six-inch display and IPX8 waterproof design, but the e-reader now offers color. It’s also noticeably faster — something I was happy to see, considering the occasional lag on the Clara 2E sometimes got on my nerves. You don’t get the Clara Colour’s physical buttons or stylus support, but that’s a fair tradeoff at this price point. Last year, the company also announced a white version for the same price that touts a slightly larger 1,900mAh battery (up from 1,500mAh on the black model), which Kobo says can last over a month on a single charge. Nook Glowlight 4 Plus In 2023, Barnes and Noble released the Nook Glowlight 4 Plus. If you own a lot of digital books from Barnes and Noble, this could be a good Kindle alternative. Otherwise, I’d still recommend the Kobo Libra Colour to everybody else. The $199.99 Nook Glowlight 4 Plus is a good e-reader with a lot to offer, including a lovely 300ppi screen, waterproofing, physical page-turning buttons, and even a headphone jack. However, it’s just not as snappy, which makes setting it up, buying books from the device itself, and navigating the interface a slow ordeal. It didn’t help that the screen sometimes froze, too, which meant I had to restart the device while in the middle of a book. Boox Palma 2 Despite all the advantages of E Ink display technology, your smartphone is probably still a more convenient device for reading given how pocket-friendly it is. The Boox Palma 2 is a smartphone-sized E Ink device that’s just as easy to slip into a pocket, but with more capabilities than an e-reader. Its 6.3-inch E Ink display is great for reading books, but the $299.99 Palma 2 also runs Android 13, so you can install productivity apps like email and messaging — assuming you’ve got access to Wi-Fi, of course, because the compact e-reader lacks cellular connectivity. If you already have the original Palma, the sequel isn’t worth the upgrade. But if you’re looking for a smaller alternative to Kindles and Kobos, the Palma 2 could be worth the splurge. – Andrew Liszewski, Senior Reporter Boox Go 10.3 The $409.99 Onyx Boox Go 10.3 is another ad-free ebook reader you can use to take notes. It’s excellent as a note-taking device, and it offers an impressively wide range of writing tools and more prebuilt notebook templates than Kobo’s Elipsa 2E. Jotting down notes using the built-in notebook felt more akin to writing on paper as well, and its slim design makes the device feel more like a traditional notebook. Like all Boox devices, it also provides quick access to the Google Play Store, so you can download multiple reading apps — including both Kindle and Kobo apps. The slate’s crisp 300ppi display is sharper than that of the Kobo Elipsa 2E, too, which is a plus. However, compared to the easy-to-use Elipsa 2E, the Go 10.3 lacks a front light and has a steeper learning curve. Notes you take on a Kindle or Kobo device won’t transfer over (and vice versa), and you can’t annotate books in either app using the Boox. I also felt like access to Google Play can be a double-edged sword as it grants easy access to distracting apps, including games, streaming services, and TikTok. It’s too slow to use the latter, but it’s fast and comfortable enough that I found myself playing around with the Word Search app far too often. For me personally, I need my e-reader to be devoid of such distractions — it’s one of the biggest things that distinguishes it from a tablet, after all. But if you’ve got more self-control than I do, the Go 10.3 could be worth a look. Boox Go Color 7 Gen II In April, Boox introduced the Go Color 7 Gen II, which retails for $279.99. This water-resistant e-reader offers a 300ppi display that drops to 150ppi when displaying color content, much like its Kobo and Kindle rivals. However, similar to the Kobo Libra Colour, this ad-free model offers physical-page turning buttons and supports note-taking. A stylus isn’t included, so you’ll need to spend an extra $45.99 for Boox’s pressure-sensitive InkSense pen if you want to take notes. And, like other Boox devices, it runs on Android, giving you access to a wide range of apps and online bookstores through the Google Play Store. While I appreciated not having to sideload my Kindle and Kobo library, along with greater flexibility to fine-tune color settings, I ultimately prefer the Kobo Libra Colour. In my testing, the Go Color 7 Gen II felt frustratingly sluggish by comparison to the Libra Colour, which is disappointing given the Boox costs $50 more. Responsiveness is a core part of the reading experience for me, so I’d only recommend Boox’s model to readers who value having Android app flexibility over performance. Kindle Scribe Colorsoft The $629.99 Kindle Scribe Colorsoft is Amazon’s first color e-reader that’s also designed for note-taking. In her review, my colleague Victoria Song praised its thin, lightweight design, long battery life, and minimal ghosting effect. However, she thought the 11-inch display feels too large for reading or note-taking, and that the muted E Ink colors limit the appeal for artists who want to draw things beyond basic doodles. It’s also a shame that many of its best annotation features — including in-line writing and the AI-powered summarization and search tools — don’t extend to other document types, such as PDFs. Update, February 20th: Adjusted pricing / availability and added a mention of Amazon’s new “Send to Alexa Plus” feature. Andrew Liszewski also contributed to this post."

If you mostly buy ebooks from Amazon, you’ll want a Kindle, and the 12th-gen Kindle Paperwhite is the best choice for most people. It’s $70 cheaper than the Kobo Libra Colour — my top non-Amazon e-reader — yet offers many of the same features, including a spacious 7-inch 300pi display with rich contrast levels. Unlike Amazon’s entry-level Kindle, it also features IPX8 water resistance and an adjustable warm frontlight that reduces blue light, which can interrupt melatonin production. The $199.99 [Signature Edition Paperwhite](https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Amazon-Kindle-Paperwhite-Signature/dp/B0C8RR4WN3/?tag=theverge02-20) also supports wireless charging, a rare feature in an e-reader.

_The latest Kindle Paperwhite offers a sharp display that’s easy to read._

Amazon dominates the US ebook market, so Kindle owners have access to advantages that owners of other ebook readers don’t. Much of Amazon’s hardware strategy depends on offering cut-rate discounts to pull you into its content ecosystem. If you have Prime and buy a lot of Kindle ebooks, the Paperwhite is the best choice because its ebooks and audiobooks are often on sale at Amazon, and Prime members get more free content through Prime Reading. Rivals like Kobo offer sales, too, but it’s hard for them to offer discounts as steep as Amazon.

There are downsides, though. The Paperwhite includes lockscreen ads unless you pay $20 to remove them, and its size can make one-handed reading uncomfortable. More significantly, like all Kindles, it uses a proprietary format and doesn’t natively support EPUB, the open standard used by most other ebook stores. If you often shop from Kobo’s bookstore, Barnes & Noble, or Google Play Books, you’ll need [to convert](https://www.theverge.com/23842102/kindle-amazon-import-files-epub) and [transfer file formats](https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle?tag=theverge02-20) in order to read them on a Kindle. If you mostly stick with Amazon, though, you’ll be more than happy with the Paperwhite.

__**Dimensions:** 5.69 x 6.34 x 0.33 inches / **Weight:** 199.5 grams / **Screen area and resolution:** 7-inch screen, 300ppi (black-and-white), 150ppi (color) / **Storage:** 32GB / **Other features:** Physical page-turning buttons, waterproofing, Kobo Stylus 2 support, Bluetooth audio support__

The Kobo Libra Colour is a great alternative to Amazon’s ebook readers, particularly for readers outside the US or anyone who prefers not to buy into Amazon’s ecosystem. It offers many of the standout features found on the 12th-gen Paperwhite — including waterproofing, USB-C, and a 300ppi display — along with a few extra perks. Most notably, it uses E Ink’s latest Kaleido color technology, delivering soft, pastel-like hues that still pop in direct sunlight. Resolution drops to 150ppi when viewing color, but it still makes viewing a wider range of content more pleasant, even if images aren’t nearly as vivid as those on a traditional tablet or the [Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition](https://www.theverge.com/24303322/amazon-kindle-colorsoft-e-reader-review).

Unlike Amazon’s Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition, the Libra Colour also works with a stylus ([sold separately](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.kobobooks.com%2Fproducts%2Fkobo-stylus-2&xcust=__vg0220awD__23533109____s______________google.com)), letting you highlight in multiple colors, annotate books, and use Kobo’s integrated notebooks. It borrows some more advanced tools from the Kobo Elipsa 2E, too, including handwriting-to-text conversion and math-solving, allowing it to double as a small digital notebook. It also includes physical page-turn buttons, lacks lockscreen ads, supports more file formats (including EPUB), and makes borrowing from OverDrive libraries relatively straightforward. A recent update even provides support for Instapaper, letting you save articles, blog posts, and other content for offline viewing.

[![A photo of a page in a book with a sentence highlighted in pink.](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25532400/247144_Kobo_Libre_Colour_SVasani_0005.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400)](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25532400/247144_Kobo_Libre_Colour_SVasani_0005.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0,0,100,100)

However, at $229.99, the Libra Colour costs $70 more than the entry-level Paperwhite — and that’s without Kobo’s $69.99 stylus, which is required to perform certain tasks. The gap widens further when the Paperwhite is on sale, which happens more frequently. The Libra Colour also can’t easily access Amazon’s ebook library, either, so longtime Kindle users may need third-party tools to convert their purchases. Still, if those things don’t matter or apply to you, the Libra Colour offers the most versatile and enjoyable reading experience of any e-reader on this list. It remains my personal favorite.

## The best cheap ebook reader

$110

#### The Good

-   Excellent, high-resolution display
-   Easy to hold with one hand
-   Faster than its predecessor with improved battery life
-   Fun color options

#### The Bad

-   No waterproofing
-   Lacks adjustable color temperature
-   Slightly more expensive than its predecessor

__**Dimensions:** 6.2 x 4.3 x 0.32 inches / **Weight:** 158 grams / **Screen area and resolution**: 6-inch screen, 300ppi resolution / **Storage:** 16GB / **Other features:** USB-C support, Bluetooth audio support__

The [base-model Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle/dp/B0CNV9F72P/?tag=theverge02-20) ($109.99 with ads) is the best cheap ebook reader. Its 300ppi resolution makes text clearer and easier to read than the lower-resolution screens on other ebook readers in its price range. Plus, it has USB-C for relatively fast charging.

Reading on its six-inch screen feels a little more cramped than it does on the larger displays of the Kindle Paperwhite and Kobo Libra Colour. However, the flip side is that its small size makes it pocketable, light, and easy for small hands to hold. Combined with its relatively affordable price, the Kindle is also the best ebook reader for kids — especially the [Amazon Kindle Kids Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CNVBQK38/?tag=theverge02-20), which costs $20 more. The kid-friendly version shares the same specs but is ad-free with parental controls, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and a case. It also includes six months of [Amazon Kids Plus](https://www.amazon.com/ftu/home?tag=theverge02-20), which grants kids access to thousands of children’s books and audiobooks for free. After that, though, you’ll have to pay $79 per year (or $48 with Amazon Prime).

[![The 11th-generation Kindle being held.](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/257516_best_ebook_reader_SVasani_0004.webp?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400)](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/257516_best_ebook_reader_SVasani_0004.webp?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0,0,100,100)

The base Kindle doesn’t have extra conveniences like the waterproofing, which you’ll find in [the entry-level Kobo Clara BW](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.kobobooks.com%2Fcollections%2Fereaders%2Fproducts%2Fkobo-clara-bw) and aforementioned Kindle Paperwhite. You also don’t get the physical page-turning buttons found on entry-level e-readers like Barnes & Noble’s [Nook GlowLight 4e](https://www.theverge.com/23188252/barnes-noble-nook-glowlight-4e-e-reader-ebook-review) (though the Kindle is a lot snappier than the Nook). And because it’s an Amazon ebook reader, you’re also locked into the Amazon ecosystem and have to pay extra to remove ads. But if you can do without that, the Kindle delivers the essentials for under $110.

## The best ebook reader for taking notes

$400

#### The Good

-   Intuitive note-taking features
-   Great e-reader
-   Adjustable warm light
-   Useful note-taking capabilities, including handwriting-to-text conversion

#### The Bad

-   Lacks native support for Kindle books
-   227ppi display isn’t as sharp as the competition
-   No note-summarization features

__**Dimensions:** 7.6 x 8.94 x 0.30 inches / **Weight:** 390 grams / **Screen area and resolution**: 10.3-inches, 227ppi resolution / **Storage:** 32GB / **Other features:** Handwriting to text conversion, magnetic stylus, Bluetooth audio support__

Of all the large ebook readers I’ve tested, the Kobo Elipsa 2E stood out the most because it’s a good e-reader with solid note-taking abilities. You can write directly on pages just as in a physical book. The Kindle Scribe lets you annotate book pages as well, but it’s complicated, involving resizable text boxes that mess up the page formatting and prevent you from doing basic things like circling words. In contrast, taking notes on the Elipsa 2E feels far more intuitive and natural.

The Elipsa 2E offers other helpful note-taking tools and capabilities. Like the Kobo Libra Colour, it’s capable, for example, of solving math equations for you. You can also insert diagrams and drawings, and it’ll automatically snap them into something that looks cleaner and nicer. You can also sync your notes with Dropbox or view them online and convert handwriting to typed text. The Kindle Scribe offers the latter capability, too, but again, Kobo does it faster and better within the original notebook document rather than on a separate page. The only thing missing from the Elipsa 2E is the Scribe’s note-summarization feature, but that’s a tradeoff I am okay with given how much easier it is to take notes.

[![You can doodle in the Kobo Elipsa 2E using a variety of ink shades, pens, and brushes.](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/236710_E_reader_Kobo_Elipsa_2E_SVasani_0004.webp?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400)](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/236710_E_reader_Kobo_Elipsa_2E_SVasani_0004.webp?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0,0,100,100)

Note-taking capabilities aside, the Kobo Elipsa 2E is also a good e-reader with the same strengths and weaknesses as other Kobo devices. There’s support for a wide range of file formats, but you can’t easily read Kindle books without converting them first. Its 227ppi display is also slightly less sharp than the 300ppi screen found on the Kindle Scribe and the Kobo Libra Colour. However, the 10.3-inch screen balances things out a bit and makes text easier to read, so it’s not a noticeable drawback. Plus, the Elipsa 2E comes with an adjustable warm light for nighttime reading. That’s a feature rival e-readers with more advanced note-taking capabilities — including the $409.99 [Onyx Boox Go 10.3](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.boox.com%2Fproducts%2Fgo103&xcust=__vg0115awD__24092328__________________), which lets you insert links to notes — lack.

## Other ebook readers we tested

There are some other ebook readers my colleagues and I have tested that I didn’t feature above, but are still worth highlighting. Here are the most notable:

The [Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition](https://www.theverge.com/24303322/amazon-kindle-colorsoft-e-reader-review) is the first Kindle to feature E Ink’s color screen technology, and it stands out from other color e-paper devices with customizations. It offers improved contrast, more vibrant colors, and faster screen refreshes. With a $279.99 price tag, it’s the most expensive Kindle model currently available that doesn’t support a stylus for note-taking, and it includes premium features like wireless charging that are convenient but not really necessary for a device with months of battery life. If you want a color screen and want to stick with Amazon, the Colorsoft Signature is your best option. _- Andrew Liszewski, Senior Reporter_

[Amazon recently introduced](https://www.theverge.com/news/712765/amazon-kindle-colorsoft-16-gb-kids) a more affordable alternative to the $279.99 Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition called the [Kindle Colorsoft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGVSKR1G?tag=theverge02-20). It’s $30 cheaper and delivers a nearly identical reading experience, but lacks wireless charging and only offers 16GB of storage. That’s plenty of space for ebooks, but it might not be enough if you own a lot of graphic novels. The entry-level Kindle Colorsoft also [supports Amazon’s new “Send to Alexa Plus” feature](https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/877625/amazon-send-to-alexa-plus-kindle-scribe-hands-on), which lets you send notes or documents to Amazon’s [Alexa Plus](https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/705808/amazon-alexa-plus-first-look) assistant for summaries, to-do lists, reminders, or brainstorming. After a day of testing, I found it useful overall, though it sometimes lacked nuance.

The biggest drawback for me, as a bedtime bookworm, is the lack of an auto-adjusting front light, which can make nighttime reading much easier (however, its brightness and color temperature can be manually adjusted). Given that the Colorsoft Signature Edition costs just $30 more, complete with a front light that adjusts when the room gets dim, 32GB of storage, and wireless charging, I’d opt for that instead if you’re in Amazon’s ecosystem. Unless the standard Colorsoft goes on sale for less, it’s not a great value at its regular price.

If you’re looking for a non-Amazon alternative that’s more affordable than the Kobo Libra Colour, the [Kobo Clara Colour](https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/4/24158251/kobo-libra-clara-colour-e-reader-review) — the successor to the [Kobo Clara 2E](https://www.theverge.com/23542918/kobo-clara-2e-ereader-review-amazon-kindle) — is worth a look. At [$159.99](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.kobobooks.com%2Fproducts%2Fkobo-clara-colour), the ad-free e-reader costs more than the [Kobo Clara 2E](https://www.theverge.com/23542918/kobo-clara-2e-ereader-review-amazon-kindle), but I think it’s worth the extra $10. It continues to offer the same six-inch display and IPX8 waterproof design, but the e-reader now offers color. It’s also noticeably faster — something I was happy to see, considering the occasional lag on the Clara 2E sometimes got on my nerves. You don’t get the Clara Colour’s physical buttons or stylus support, but that’s a fair tradeoff at this price point.

Last year, the company also [announced](https://www.theverge.com/news/775526/kobo-clara-colour-e-reader-white-color-larger-battery) a [white version](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.kobobooks.com%2Fproducts%2Fkobo-clara-colour) for the same price that touts a slightly larger 1,900mAh battery (up from 1,500mAh on the black model), which Kobo says can last over a month on a single charge.

In 2023, Barnes and Noble released the [Nook Glowlight 4 Plus](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/21/23803227/barnes-and-nobles-forthcoming-e-reader-a-new-kindle-alternative). If you own a lot of digital books from Barnes and Noble, this could be a good Kindle alternative. Otherwise, I’d still recommend the Kobo Libra Colour to everybody else. The [$199.99 Nook Glowlight 4 Plus](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2Fnook-glowlight-4-plus-barnes-noble%2F1143603294) is a good e-reader with a lot to offer, including a lovely 300ppi screen, waterproofing, physical page-turning buttons, and even a headphone jack. However, it’s just not as snappy, which makes setting it up, buying books from the device itself, and navigating the interface a slow ordeal. It didn’t help that the screen sometimes froze, too, which meant I had to restart the device while in the middle of a book.

Despite all the advantages of E Ink display technology, your smartphone is probably still a more convenient device for reading given how pocket-friendly it is. The [Boox Palma 2](https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/24/24301379/boox-palma-2-review-e-reader-android) is a smartphone-sized E Ink device that’s just as easy to slip into a pocket, but with more capabilities than an e-reader. Its 6.3-inch E Ink display is great for reading books, but the [$299.99 Palma 2](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.boox.com%2Fproducts%2Fpalma2) also runs Android 13, so you can install productivity apps like email and messaging — assuming you’ve got access to Wi-Fi, of course, because the compact e-reader lacks cellular connectivity. If you already have the original Palma, the sequel isn’t worth the upgrade. But if you’re looking for a smaller alternative to Kindles and Kobos, the Palma 2 could be worth the splurge. _\- Andrew Liszewski, Senior Reporter_

The [$409.99 Onyx Boox Go 10.3](https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Tablet-10-3-ePaper-Front/dp/B0DT3J3SVW/?tag=theverge02-20) is another ad-free ebook reader you can use to take notes. It’s excellent as a note-taking device, and it offers an impressively wide range of writing tools and more prebuilt notebook templates than Kobo’s Elipsa 2E. Jotting down notes using the built-in notebook felt more akin to writing on paper as well, and its slim design makes the device feel more like a traditional notebook. Like all Boox devices, it also provides quick access to the Google Play Store, so you can download multiple reading apps — including both Kindle and Kobo apps. The slate’s crisp 300ppi display is sharper than that of the Kobo Elipsa 2E, too, which is a plus.

However, compared to the easy-to-use Elipsa 2E, the Go 10.3 lacks a front light and has a steeper learning curve. Notes you take on a Kindle or Kobo device won’t transfer over (and vice versa), and you can’t annotate books in either app using the Boox. I also felt like access to Google Play can be a double-edged sword as it grants easy access to distracting apps, including games, streaming services, and TikTok. It’s too slow to use the latter, but it’s fast and comfortable enough that I found myself playing around with the Word Search app far too often. For me personally, I need my e-reader to be devoid of such distractions — it’s one of the biggest things that distinguishes it from a tablet, after all. But if you’ve got more self-control than I do, the Go 10.3 could be worth a look.

In April, Boox [introduced](https://www.theverge.com/news/656174/boox-go-7-series-e-ink-e-reader-stylus-color) the Go Color 7 Gen II, which retails for [$279.99](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.boox.com%2Fproducts%2Fgocolor7-gen2). This water-resistant e-reader offers a 300ppi display that drops to 150ppi when displaying color content, much like its Kobo and Kindle rivals. However, similar to the Kobo Libra Colour, this ad-free model offers physical-page turning buttons and supports note-taking. A stylus isn’t included, so you’ll need to spend an extra [$45.99](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.boox.com%2Fproducts%2Fboox-inksense%3Fvariant%3D45884854141158) for Boox’s pressure-sensitive InkSense pen if you want to take notes. And, like other Boox devices, it runs on Android, giving you access to a wide range of apps and online bookstores through the Google Play Store.

While I appreciated not having to sideload my Kindle and Kobo library, along with greater flexibility to fine-tune color settings, I ultimately prefer the Kobo Libra Colour. In my testing, the Go Color 7 Gen II felt frustratingly sluggish by comparison to the Libra Colour, which is disappointing given the Boox costs $50 more. Responsiveness is a core part of the reading experience for me, so I’d only recommend Boox’s model to readers who value having Android app flexibility over performance.

The [$629.99 Kindle Scribe Colorsoft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DWRBVDN6?tag=theverge02-20) is Amazon’s first color e-reader that’s also designed for note-taking. [In her review](https://www.theverge.com/tech/844673/amazon-kindle-scribe-colorsoft-review-ereader-eink-tablet), my colleague Victoria Song praised its thin, lightweight design, long battery life, and minimal ghosting effect. However, she thought the 11-inch display feels too large for reading or note-taking, and that the muted E Ink colors limit the appeal for artists who want to draw things beyond basic doodles. It’s also a shame that many of its best annotation features — including in-line writing and the AI-powered summarization and search tools — don’t extend to other document types, such as PDFs.

## What I’m looking for

When testing a new ebook reader, I make sure to use it as my primary device for at least a full week. For those seven days, if not longer, that e-reader is my principal way of consuming ebooks, audiobooks, and most articles from the web (if applicable). If the device has note-taking capabilities, I’ll use it to annotate books and jot down various reminders, to-do lists, and notes. I’ll even use it for some light journaling, as well as doodling.On average, I tend to read for about an hour a day — longer on weekends — either for work or to unwind at the beach, in bed, or in the bathtub. I buy books directly from each e-reader’s respective bookstore, borrow library books via Overdrive, and try to sideload various file formats to see how easy it is to do.

How easy is it to use and read on? A sharp display and relatively fast performance are essential to an enjoyable reading experience, as are size and weight.

Some e-readers come with different features, like waterproofing, which means you really can read anywhere. Others offer buttons that make using the e-reader more intuitive to use.

There must be easy, direct access to a wide selection of digital titles, including audiobooks and various file formats.

Is the price justified, given what the e-reader offers?

_**Update, February 20th:** Adjusted pricing / availability and added a mention of Amazon’s new “Send to Alexa Plus” feature. Andrew Liszewski also contributed to this post._
