Good electric bikes are expensive. So why not buy one and share it?

That’s the idea behind the [Tenways CGO Compact](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tenways.com%2Fproducts%2Fcgo-compact) e-bike I’ve been sharing with my wife and teenage daughter for the last two weeks. It adapts in seconds without any tools to comfortably fit riders of varying heights thanks to its low-entry frame, quick-release seat post, and height-adjustable handlebar.

It also takes up less space than an ordinary bike with its 20-inch wheels, folding pedals, and a handlebar that twists to create a slim, wall-hugging profile that goes flat inside a car or train.

The CGO Compact’s geometry puts riders into a comfortable upright body position. Combine that with wide tires and a heavy aluminum frame – heavier than many full-sized e-bikes – and it feels remarkably sturdy despite its size, with a rear carrier system strong enough to hold a child or a few days of groceries.

The shareable e-bike [isn’t a new idea](https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/26/18639544/vanmoof-x2-review-electric-bike-replace-family-car), but Tenways comes close to perfecting it with the €1,999 (about $2,365) CGO Compact.

-   No service upsells
-   Low battery alerts

#### The Bad

-   App is just fine
-   Quick release seat easy to steal

Tenways, the Amsterdam-HQ’d e-bike company of Chinese origin, has been on a tear in Europe thanks to the post-pandemic chaos that took out much of its competition. The brand makes great looking e-bikes from off-the-shelf parts supported by a robust service network. Importantly, they sell below the [€2,681 (about $3,160) e-bike average](https://www.bike-eu.com/50105/e-bike-sales-in-europe-see-further-cooling-down) — expensive compared to the US, but far less likely to burst into flames.

My Tenways review e-bike arrived at my front door in a giant cardboard box. It seemed big enough to fit the CGO Compact fully assembled and with the handlebar twisted, yet I still had to attach the steering column and front wheel myself. The e-bike took about 20 minutes to unbox, but I’ve been assembling direct-to-consumer e-bikes about once a month for the last decade.

_The folding pedals help create a wall-hugging profile that’s easy to walk past._

The first thing I did after assembly was play with the Byschulz Speedlifter Twist Stem. It’s magical. Open the lever to quickly raise and lower the handlebar, or to gain access to a pin release that lets the handlebar twist out of the way. It took a little practice for everyone to master but we soon got the hang of it.

The small LCD dashboard is bright and colorful even in the sun. You have to enter a four-digit PIN code at power-on, which can only be changed in the rudimentary app over Bluetooth. It’s the only theft-deterrence Tenways offers on the CGO Compact, which also means it won’t try to upsell you on subscriptions or software-locked features.

[![](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/IMG_5705-ezgif.com-resize.gif?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400)](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/IMG_5705-ezgif.com-resize.gif?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0,0,100,100)

Despite our height differences, ranging from 164cm to 183cm (5ft 5in to 6 feet), everyone found the CGO Compact to be very comfortable. Adjusting the handlebar and saddle takes less than 10 seconds, and the suspension seatpost did a good job of soaking up small bumps. But the seat’s quick release mechanism offers no additional security to prevent the post and saddle from being stolen. A no-no in the big European cities this bike targets.

The e-bike’s torque sensor made the ride exceptionally intuitive, ensuring that the power delivered by the 250W rear-hub motor was tuned to match the downward force exerted on the pedals. The motor was also very quiet, masked entirely by the sound of the wide, 2.4-inch tires riding over asphalt.

The Tenways motor is only capable of 45Nm of torque. And without additional gears, the CGO Compact is best for mostly flat environments. It still did better than I expected on hills, easily besting [the 35Nm Raleigh One I recently reviewed](https://www.theverge.com/reviews/786538/raleigh-one-e-bike-review-vanmoof-carlier-ties-taco). For example, I was able to cross a bridge with a 10 percent incline that stymied the Raleigh One, but only if I had a rolling start — otherwise, I had to get off and push. On downhill slopes, the large chainring allowed me to pedal comfortably at speeds approaching 30km/h without my legs frantically spinning out. The pedal-assist, however, quits helping at 25km/h (16mph) in Europe.

I also didn’t experience any of the twitchiness you get from folding bikes with relatively short wheelbases, smaller 16-inch wheels, and narrow handlebars. In general I rode in pedal-assist levels 3 or 4 out of 5, with 3 feeling the most natural, and 4 for when I was in a hurry.

**1/25**

_The suspension seat post soaked up bumps on a variety of road surfaces._

On a full battery I managed to travel 65kms (over 40 miles) before needing a recharge. I received alerts on my iPhone and Apple Watch when the battery dropped to 10 percent, and power dropped noticeably when the estimated remaining range hit 4km. Charging the 494.36Wh battery took a relatively slow 4.5 hours from the bundled charger.

The CGO Compact was obviously designed by people that actually ride bikes in compact European cities. It comes standard with integrated lighting, mudguards, a loud bell, kickstand, and a partially covered transmission to protect trousers, skirts, and long coats from getting snagged. The little crossbar in the step-through frame even doubles as a handle to help hoist the bike up stairs.

City bikes need to haul things, which is why the CGO Compact comes fitted with the click-and-go MIK HD rear carrier system. It supports loads up to 27kg (almost 60 pounds) — enough to fit a compatible crate or child seat. The e-bike also has mounting points up front for a bottle cage or rack.

In general, the Android and iOS app is fine, but it’s rarely needed. It might eventually be useful for buying accessories and insurance, or starting a chat with support and finding the nearest service center. It also promises to show riding data collected by date, but this never worked for me, only showing zeroes.

Tenways’ CGO Compact is an excellent e-bike for €1,999 (about $2,365). The riding experience, everyone agrees, has been stellar. And when it eventually needs servicing, Tenways has a solid network of local bike shops in Europe to provide support, with a ready supply of the off-the-shelf parts from brands you know.

The CGO Compact is a highly adaptable e-bike that rides big and tucks away small, making it an ideal companion for European city life. It’s also exceedingly shareable — but nobody would blame you for keeping it all for yourself.
