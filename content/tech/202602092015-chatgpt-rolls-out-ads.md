OpenAI on Monday announced it’s beginning to test ads in the U.S. for users on its Free and Go subscription tiers. The newer Go plan is a low-cost subscription at $8 per month in the U.S. and was introduced globally in mid-January. Subscribers to OpenAI’s paid plans, including its Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Education tiers, will not see ads, the company said. OpenAI sought to address concerns about how ads might affect the user experience, stating in a blog post: “Ads do not influence the answers ChatGPT gives you, and we keep your conversations with ChatGPT private from advertisers. Our goal is for ads to support broader access to more powerful ChatGPT features while maintaining the trust people place in ChatGPT for important and personal tasks.” The move, which the company announced last month, drew ridicule in a series of Super Bowl ads that ran on Sunday from a top rival, Anthropic. In its TV commercials, Anthropic poked fun at the idea that some AI companies, like OpenAI, would soon include advertising by showing how poorly integrated ads could disrupt the consumer experience. This was portrayed on-screen by glassy-eyed actors playing AI chatbots, who would deliver their advice alongside a poorly targeted ad. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman got extremely testy about the jabs, calling the ads “dishonest” and Anthropic an “authoritarian company.” Techcrunch event Boston, MA | June 23, 2026 Consumers have so far resisted the idea of ads in AI responses. OpenAI faced a backlash late last year when it tested app suggestions that looked like unwanted ads. Still, the AI company needs to generate revenue from its popular chatbot to cover the costs of developing its technology and growing the business. While understandable, critics fear that ads could influence ChatGPT’s answers. OpenAI denies this in its announcement, saying that ads will be optimized based on “what’s most helpful to you.” The company says ads will also always be clearly labeled as sponsored and separated from the organic content. In tests, OpenAI has tried matching ads to users based on the subject of their conversations, past chats, and previous ad interactions. For instance, users researching recipes might see ads for grocery delivery services or meal kits, the company says. OpenAI said advertisers won’t have access to user data, only aggregate information about ad performance, like views and clicks. Users will also be able to view their history of interactions with ads and clear it at any time. Plus, OpenAI said users can dismiss ads, share feedback, view why they were shown an ad, and manage ad personalization settings. Ads won’t be shown to users under 18, nor will they be placed near sensitive or regulated topics like health, politics, or mental health.
