summary: "Shokz OpenFit Air earbuds are $40 off in all colorways. | Image: The Verge If you like to take your workouts outside, open-ear earbuds are helpful for staying aware of surroundings, but that extra peace of mind often comes at the expense of bass. The Shokz OpenFit Air Earbuds actually try to address that problem, though, and they’re currently $79.95 ($40 off) at Amazon, Target, and directly from Shokz — which is their best price to date. Shokz OpenFit Air Where to Buy: $119.95 $79.95 at Amazon $119.95 $79.99 at Best Buy Unlike many of Shokz’ other models, the OpenFit Air uses traditional air conduction — similar to a pair of wireless earbuds — instead of bone conduction tech, which results in noticeably decent bass performance. Granted, they still can’t match traditional in-ear wireless earbuds, but they at least sound less muddy than a lot of bone conduction alternatives. Ear hooks also keep the OpenFit Air in place, and for the most part they’re comfortable (though they can feel less stable when you’re donning glasses, as our wearables reviewer found out in her testing). They’ve also got decent battery life that lasts six hours on a single charge which is fine for most workouts. Plus, they carry an IP55 rating for sweat and water resistance, so they can withstand sweaty workouts and light rain. Read our Shokz OpenFit Air review. Some more ways to save: The Kobo Clara Colour is on sale for $139.99 ($20 off) at Amazon, directly from Rakuten Kobo, and Best Buy, which matches its best price to date. The e-reader is a budget alternative to the $209.99 ($20 off) Kobo Libra Colour, our favorite non-Amazon e-reader, offering a color screen that’s sharp and snappy. It also boasts an IPX8 waterproof design, though it’s smaller at six-inches and lacks the Libra Colour’s physical page-turning buttons as well as stylus compatibility. You can buy a four-pack of Samsung’s SmartTag 2 item trackers from Woot for $44.99 ($45 off), which is a new low that brings the cost down to about $11.25 per tracker. They’re a solid Android-friendly alternative to AirTags and work best with Samsung Galaxy phones, offering UWB tracking and access to Samsung’s Galaxy Find network for precise location tracking. If you’re on the hunt for a unique Valentine’s Day gift, I’m a big fan of Glamour Boutique’s preserved roses. They last and look great longer than your typical bouquet, and right now they’re about the same price, too, with the box of 16 pink roses starting at $35.95 ($10 off) at Amazon. I’ve owned mine for almost two years, and they still look as beautiful in the heart-shaped box as the day I got them. Amazon also sells them in red and more unique shades, like purple. You can also choose from smaller or larger options, ranging from seven to 50 roses."
