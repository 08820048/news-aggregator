DJI, the most popular consumer drone maker, is suing over the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)’s import [ban against new, foreign-made drones](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/djis-new-drones-will-not-be-available-in-the-us-as-fcc-ban-takes-effect/), which has been in effect since December 23, 2025.

On Tuesday, the Shenzhen-headquartered company filed a petition [\[PDF\]](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gov.uscourts.ca9_.b4c4b372-7c0e-f111-bb47-001dd808eb4a.1.0.pdf) with the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that seeks to overturn the FCC’s decision to list DJI on its [Covered List](https://www.fcc.gov/supplychain/coveredlist). The Covered List includes communications equipment and services that are “deemed to pose an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States or the security and safety of United States persons,” per the FCC.

In its petition dated February 20, 2026, DJI said:

> Petitioners seek review of the Ruling on the ground that the FCC exceeded its statutory authority, failed to observe statutorily required procedures, and violated the Fifth Amendment when it purported to add DJI’s products to the Covered List. Petitioners respectfully request his Court hold unlawful, vacate, enjoin, and set aside the Ruling and grant any other relief that the Court finds proper.

In January, the FCC [exempted](https://www.google.com/search?q=reuters+drones+exemtpions&rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1137US1137&oq=reuters+drones+exemtpions&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDI2NzVqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) a limited number of foreign-made drones, including some coming from Europe, until the end of this year. The FCC also provided exemptions for some foreign-made critical drone components, including those from Japanese companies Sony and Panasonic, and South Korean company Samsung. The FCC hasn’t exempted any drones or drone parts made in China.

In a December 22 [statement](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DOC-416839A1.pdf), the FCC said that “criminals, hostile foreign actors, and terrorists can use \[drones\] to present new and serious threats to our homeland.” The FCC said at the time that it made its decision about the ban after a review by an Executive Branch interagency body review that it said had “appropriate national security expertise” and “was convened by the White House.”

DJI reportedly requested that the US government audit its devices multiple times before the US issued the import ban.

In a company statement shared with [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-24/china-s-dji-takes-fight-with-fcc-over-drone-ban-to-appeals-court) today, DJI said:

> Despite repeated efforts to engage with the government, DJI has never been given the chance to provide information to address or refute any concerns. These procedural and substantive deficiencies violate the Constitution and federal law.

In a statement to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/chinese-dronemaker-dji-files-lawsuit-challenge-us-import-ban-new-models-2026-02-24/) today, DJI also said that the FCC’s decision “carelessly restricts DJI’s business in the US and summarily denies U.S. customers access to its latest technology.”
