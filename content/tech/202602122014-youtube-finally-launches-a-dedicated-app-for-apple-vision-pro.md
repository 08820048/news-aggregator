After two years of [initial hesitation](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/01/youtube-is-not-building-a-vision-pro-app-so-apollo-for-reddit-dev-made-one/), YouTube has finally unveiled its [dedicated app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id6745572359) for the Apple Vision Pro.

When Apple’s headset first launched, [YouTube](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/19/youtube-and-other-apps-missing-from-apple-vision-pro-launch/) opted for a web-based approach instead of developing a dedicated app, directing viewers to use Safari to access content. Until now, anyone wanting to watch YouTube on the headset has missed out on helpful features like offline downloads — making it much less useful for travel or offline viewing. 

To fill the gap, third-party options, such as [Juno](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/02/juno-the-youtube-app-for-vision-pro-pulled-from-app-store/), briefly appeared on visionOS before being removed for violating YouTube’s Terms of Service.

Today’s announcement changes the game, allowing users to enjoy their favorite content — including all standard videos and YouTube Shorts —on a theater-sized virtual screen in a fully immersive environment. 

Standout features include a Spatial tab that lets users discover spatial videos, including 3D, VR180, and 360-degree formats. For consumers with the latest Apple Vision Pro models powered by the M5 chip, the app supports 8K playback, a notable upgrade.

Additionally, users can interact with the new visionOS app using gesture controls, such as resizing windows or scrubbing through videos.

The timing of this app’s release is interesting, as YouTube initially hesitated to invest in a dedicated visionOS experience, possibly waiting to gauge the headset’s traction. Most major streaming services have offered native experiences on the platform since launch, including Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, Paramount, and Peacock, among others.

Another reason why YouTube’s decision to launch the app now is interesting is that the initial hype surrounding the headset appears to have diminished. 

Despite the Apple Vision Pro introducing [Apple Intelligence-powered features](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/31/apple-brings-apple-intelligence-to-the-vision-pro/) almost a year ago, user engagement with the headset has reportedly been lukewarm. Recent [estimates](https://www.pcmag.com/news/apple-slashes-vision-pro-production-amid-poor-holiday-sales?test_uuid=04IpBmWGZleS0I0J3epvMrC&test_variant=A) indicate that sales have significantly declined, with only about 45,000 new units shipped during the fourth quarter of 2025. [The Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/ab817ba1-15ec-473f-b609-5b5016b3258d) reported that production was halted due to weak demand, resulting in a sharp reduction in marketing efforts across key markets.

The app is now available in the visionOS App Store and is compatible with both the M2 and M5 chip models.
