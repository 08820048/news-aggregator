Another year, another Stripe tender offer where investors buy shares from employees that values the company at an enormous step up.

On Tuesday, Stripe [announced](https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/stripe-2025-update) that this latest secondary transaction now values the company at $159 billion. Investors buying the shares include Thrive Capital, Coatue, Andreessen Horowitz, and Stripe itself.

In February 2025, [Stripe announced its previous tender offer](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/stripe-finalizes-tender-sale-at-a-91-5b-valuation-says-payment-volumes-grew-to-1-4t-in-2024/), which valued the company at $91.5 billion. So that’s about a 74% increase in valuation over the year. The annual announcement isn’t by chance. Stripe has timed this news with its annual letter from founders Patrick and John Collison that showcases its year of product releases, and some insights into global usage of its products for a year.

For instance, Stripe says that stablecoin payments’ volume doubled worldwide to around [$400 billion](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/stablecoins-payments-what-raw-transaction-numbers-4qjke) in 2025, 60% of which it estimates comes from B2B payments. That growth is one reason Stripe has invested heavily in crypto foundations recently, acquiring crypto wallet service Privy in July, and unveiling its own blockchain for payments, Tempo, in September. As for [Bridge](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/05/stripe-makes-1-1-billion-crypto-bet-as-it-closes-on-bridge-acquisition/), the stablecoin orchestration platform that Stripe acquired last year, it saw its volume more than quadruple, the company says.

_Correction: This story originally stated that the global stablecoin volume was on Stripe’s network and has now been corrected._
