AI-powered dictation startup [Wispr Flow](https://wisprflow.ai/) has launched its Android app today. The company released its app for Mac and Windows first, then [launched on iOS in June 2025](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/03/wispr-flow-releases-ios-app-in-a-bid-to-make-dictation-feel-effortless/).

On iOS, users could use Wispr Flow through a dedicated keyboard. On Android, the interface is a bit different, as you can access the dictionary through a floating bubble. You can hold the bubble and dictate, or press once to start, and then press the close button to stop the process. Just like on other platforms, in addition to dictation, the app cleans up the filter words and also formats the text based on the context of the app and spoken content.

“Android finally gave us the freedom to build the voice experience we always wanted. Only when the platform gets out of the way can we truly expect voice to replace typing on mobile,” Tanay Kothari, co-founder and CEO of the startup, said.

The app can support translation in over 100 languages and can work across other apps. Along with the Android app release, Wispr Flow said that it has done an infrastructure rewrite that makes dictation 30% faster than before.

“If you’re someone like me, English and Hindi weave together when I’m chatting with family and colleagues back home. This is one of those times when I just had to build something for me: the first voice model to actually support transcription in Hinglish instead of traditional Hindi script,” Kothari said.
