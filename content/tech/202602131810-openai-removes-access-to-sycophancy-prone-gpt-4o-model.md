Starting Friday, OpenAI will [cease providing access](https://x.com/OpenAINewsroom/status/2021992846862258403) to five legacy ChatGPT models, including the popular but controversial GPT-4o model.

The 4o model has been at the center of a number of [lawsuits](https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/23/chatgpt-told-them-they-were-special-their-families-say-it-led-to-tragedy/) concerning user self-harm, delusional behavior, and AI [psychosis](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/ai-sycophancy-isnt-just-a-quirk-experts-consider-it-a-dark-pattern-to-turn-users-into-profit/). It remains OpenAI’s [highest scoring model for sycophancy](https://eqbench.com/spiral-bench.html).

In addition to GPT-4o, the GPT-5, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and OpenAI o4-mini models have also been deprecated.

OpenAI intended to retire GPT-4o in August, when it unveiled the [GPT-5 model](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/07/openais-gpt-5-is-here/). But at the time, there was enough backlash for OpenAI to keep the legacy model available for paid subscribers, who could manually choose to interact with that model. In a recent blog post, OpenAI noted that only 0.1% of customers have been using GPT-4o, but for a company with [800 million weekly active users](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/sam-altman-says-chatgpt-has-hit-800m-weekly-active-users/), that small percentage still amounts to 800,000 people.

Thousands of users have [rallied against the retirement of 4o](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/06/the-backlash-over-openais-decision-to-retire-gpt-4o-shows-how-dangerous-ai-companions-can-be/), citing their close relationships with the model.
