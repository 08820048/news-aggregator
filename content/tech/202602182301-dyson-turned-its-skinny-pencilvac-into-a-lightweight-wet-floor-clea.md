Dyson has announced an alternate version of its [skinny PencilVac](https://www.theverge.com/tech/872981/dyson-pencilvac-fluffycones-vacuum-hands-on-review) that’s designed to clean spills and stains on hard floors instead of sucking up dirt and debris. Like the PencilVac, which Dyson called “world’s slimmest vacuum cleaner” when it was [announced nine months ago](https://www.theverge.com/news/671739/dyson-pencilvac-vacuum-cleaner-thin-skinny-slimmest), the new PencilWash squeezes a battery, motor, and other electronics into its 1.5-inch-diameter handle. But it trades a dust bin for a water reservoir located in its larger cleaning head featuring a single floor-scrubbing roller.

At 4.9 pounds without water or a low foaming cleaning solution in its tank, the PencilWash is slightly heavier than the four-pound PencilVac, but it’s also quite a bit cheaper. The PencilVac is $600 for the version featuring four spinning conical brush heads, while the new PencilWash is $349, including a charging stand for the handle portion.

Designed specifically for cleaning hard floors like tile, laminate, and sealed wood, the PencilWash features a pressurized hydration system to deliver fresh water that its high-density microfiber roller uses to scrub surfaces and then collect the dirty water afterwards. Floors aren’t left completely dry, but dry enough that any moisture remaining quickly evaporates. And unlike [Dyson’s larger floor scrubbers](https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/13/24155775/dyson-washg1-mop-price-specs-release-date), the PencilWash’s pivoting handle can lie nearly completely flat for reaching underneath furniture.

Battery life is estimated to be upwards of 30 minutes on a full charge, which matches the PencilVac on its lowest power setting. If that’s not enough time to clean all the floors in your palatial estate, the battery, located on the end of the PencilWash’s handle, can be swapped out with a backup that can be purchased separately.
