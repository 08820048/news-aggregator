T-Mobile is preparing to test a new AI feature that translates live phone calls into more than 50 languages. [Live Translation](https://tmobile.prf.hn/click/camref:1011l44qEJ/%5Bp_id:1011l394533%5D/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Flive-translation) is launching in beta “this Spring,” according to a press release, with [registration](https://tmobile.prf.hn/click/camref:1011l44qEJ/%5Bp_id:1011l394533%5D/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fcoverage%2Flive-translation) for eligible T-Mobile customers available starting today.

“Some of the biggest barriers wireless customers face are the simplest ones — like being able to understand each other,” said T-Mobile CEO Srini Gopalan. “By bringing real-time AI directly into our network, we’re delivering more than connectivity — turning conversations into community, starting with Live Translation.”

Enabling it at the network level means users don’t need specific apps or devices to use the service. The only requirement is that translation must be initiated by a T-Mobile network user. The feature will be available on the carrier’s 5G Advanced network, but T-Mobile President of Technology and CTO John Saw told _The Verge_ that Live Translation works over both 4G LTE and 5G:

“The key requirement is a Voice over LTE (VoLTE) connection, which allows the service to operate reliably across a wide range of devices and network conditions,” said Saw. “That flexibility is important because it ensures Live Translation works for customers wherever they are, not just when they’re on the latest network technology. Live Translation works over VoLTE, VoNR, and VoWiFi.”

T-Mobile says that beta participants can activate Live Translation “for as long as they need” by dialing 87, at no additional cost during the beta period. T-Mobile has not mentioned if Live Translation will be paywalled when it launches to the general public this year. Beta participants will also be able to activate Live Translation by saying “Hey T-Mobile” later this spring.

It’s worth flagging that the feature only works during an active call, and that T-Mobile won’t save call recordings or transcripts. “The service is designed to translate conversations in real time and then move on, without storing the content of those calls,” Saw said.
