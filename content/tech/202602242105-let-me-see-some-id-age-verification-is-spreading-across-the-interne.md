summary: "Age verification is a reality on a growing number of social media platforms, requiring an ID or facial scan for full access to everything from YouTube to Roblox. The age-gating wave is coming along with calls for stronger child safety measures online, despite concerns about privacy, security, and censorship. In the US, lawmakers are pushing forward bills like the App Store Accountability Act and Parents Over Platforms Act to have app stores themselves verify users’ ages. Discord has delayed plans to roll out age verification globally after user backlash until later in 2026, but it hasn’t completely shelved them, even after a breach of a former vendor last year that leaked some users’ scanned IDs. Meanwhile, other platforms, like ChatGPT and Google, are applying AI models to identify and lock down accounts suspected of being underage until some form of identity verification can prove the user is an adult.

    Discord won’t roll out age verification globally on its platform next month as [previously announced](https://www.theverge.com/tech/875309/discord-age-verification-global-roll-out), and says in a blog post that it’s [delaying the launch](https://discord.com/blog/getting-global-age-assurance-right-what-we-got-wrong-and-whats-changing) until the second half of 2026. “The way this landed, many of you walked away thinking we’re requiring face scans and ID uploads from everyone just to use Discord. That’s not what’s happening, but the fact that so many people believe it tells us we failed at our most basic job: clearly explaining what we’re doing and why,” writes Discord CTO Stanislav Vishnevskiy.
    
    Discord says that before it rolls out age verification globally, it will add more options for users to verify their age (including with a credit card), include documentation of every verification vendor used, add an option for “spoiler channels” in Discord as an alternative to age-gated channels for walling off certain topics, and publish a technical blog post explaining how its age estimation systems work.

    Discord is attempting to distance itself from the age verification provider Persona following a steady stream of user backlash. In an emailed statement to _The Verge_, Discord’s head of product policy, Savannah Badalich, confirms the company “ran a limited test of Persona in the UK where age assurance had previously launched and that test has since concluded.”
    
    After Discord announced plans to implement age verification [globally starting next month](https://www.theverge.com/tech/875309/discord-age-verification-global-roll-out), users [across social media](https://x.com/GiveMeBanHammer/status/2021851054519001133?s=20) [accused Discord](https://x.com/Pirat_Nation/status/2021903088005918970?s=20) [of “lying”](https://x.com/birdabo/status/2021929932545544389?s=20) about how it plans on handling face scans and ID uploads. Much of the criticism was directed toward Discord’s partnership with Persona, an age verification provider also used by [Reddit](https://www.theverge.com/news/707125/reddit-age-verification-uk-online-safety) and [Roblox](https://www.theverge.com/news/856696/roblox-age-check-estimation-chat).

    In 1973, long before the modern digital era, the US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) published a report called “Records, Computers, and the Rights of Citizens.” Networked computers seemed “destined to become the principal medium for making, storing, and using records about people,” [the report’s foreword began](https://www.justice.gov/opcl/docs/rec-com-rights.pdf). These systems could be a “powerful management tool.” But with few legal safeguards, they could erode the basic human right to privacy — particularly “control by an individual over the uses made of information about him.”

    On Tuesday, Discord [released an update](https://discord.com/safety/how-discord-is-building-safer-experiences-for-teens) clarifying that the “vast majority of people can continue using Discord exactly as they do today,” without needing to use a face scan or ID to verify their age so they can use the platform without restrictions. Discord states in the post that “age prediction” using information Discord already has will likely be sufficient for many users:
    
    However, in the case that Discord’s age inference model can’t accurately or concretely estimate a user’s age, they will still have to use a video selfie or ID to verify that they’re an adult. Users who aren’t verified as adults or determined to be under 18 will have a “teen-appropriate” experience with certain limitations, like being blocked from age-restricted servers.

    Discord is about to force some of the people who use its messaging app to make a choice: Use the platform with restricted features, or prove their age. It’s a move that platforms have been slowly approaching, but Discord’s teen-by-default rollout is a stronger clampdown that could offer a glimpse at an age-gated future on the web worldwide.
    
    [Starting next month](https://www.theverge.com/tech/875309/discord-age-verification-global-roll-out), users who don’t verify their age using a face scan or government ID will no longer be able to access age-restricted servers and channels, can’t speak in Discord’s “stage” channels, and will see filters for any content deemed graphic or sensitive, among other restrictions. They will only be able to skip age checks if Discord’s forthcoming age inference model determines that they’re an adult. The rules are a more extreme version of policies many services are rolling out, often in response [to lawsuits](https://www.theverge.com/policy/867830/social-media-trials-product-liability-school-districts) and government pressure — even if the [technology isn’t ready yet](https://www.theverge.com/analysis/715767/online-age-verification-not-ready).

    Discord [announced on Monday](https://discord.com/press-releases/discord-launches-teen-by-default-settings-globally) that it’s rolling out age verification on its platform globally starting next month, when it will automatically set all users’ accounts to a “teen-appropriate” experience unless they demonstrate that they’re adults.
    
    “For most adults, age verification won’t be required, as Discord’s age inference model uses account information such as account tenure, device and activity data, and aggregated, high-level patterns across Discord communities. Discord does not use private messages or any message content in this process,” Savannah Badalich, Discord’s global head of product policy, tells _The Verge_.

    OpenAI has added [age prediction features to ChatGPT](https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-age-prediction/), meant to identify and bolster protections for underage users. These age detection plans were [announced in December](https://www.theverge.com/news/847780/openai-anthropic-teen-safety-chatgpt-claude) alongside updated guidelines for interacting with teens and follow a rise in similar [age-gating efforts](https://www.theverge.com/analysis/715767/online-age-verification-not-ready) from online platforms, including [Instagram](https://www.theverge.com/news/651826/meta-instagram-age-detection-ai-settings), [YouTube](https://www.theverge.com/news/715343/youtube-age-estimation-ai-minor-account-restrictions), [TikTok](https://www.theverge.com/news/863673/tiktok-is-taking-a-closer-look-at-european-users-accounts-with-a-new-wave-of-age-checks), and [Roblox](https://www.theverge.com/news/856696/roblox-age-check-estimation-chat).
    
    ChatGPT’s age prediction model works by examining behavioral and account-level signals, including a user’s stated age, how old the account is, when the user is active, and usage patterns over time. Additional protections will then be applied to persons that ChatGPT estimates are under the age of 18, restricting exposure to sensitive content, such as:

    In the offline world, age verification is often as simple as flashing a cashier your driver’s license to buy a pack of beer, or an adult magazine (for whoever still does this kind of thing). Advocates for stronger barriers preventing children from accessing online porn have long argued for an equivalent on the internet: online age verification. The idea comes with different challenges than those that exist in the physical world, like the possibility of that information getting hacked, which could be enough to chill consumers from trying to access legal speech. In a 2004 Supreme Court ruling, [_Ashcroft v. ACLU_](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/542/656/), the justices found that age verification couldn’t be mandated on porn sites since policymakers had yet to show that less burdensome alternatives, like enabling parents to turn content filters on their own computers to block kids from accessing inappropriate sites, were less effective.

    Roblox is rolling out its previously announced requirement for all users to go through an age estimation process to be able to use the platform’s chat features. The policy was announced [in November 2025](https://www.theverge.com/news/822718/roblox-age-estimation-verification-chat-rollout) and was rolled out to Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands [in December](https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/12/safety-snapshot-age-checks-for-chat), but now users will be prompted to complete an age check to be able to chat in “all regions where chat is available,” [Roblox says](https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2026/01/roblox-age-checks-required-to-chat).
    
    The company’s facial scan age check process uses technology from Persona, which is [also used by Reddit](https://www.theverge.com/news/707125/reddit-age-verification-uk-online-safety). If a user wants to appeal the result of their age check, they can also verify their age via ID verification, and a parent can also use parental controls to update the age of their child.

    As usual, 2025 was a year of deep congressional dysfunction in the US. But state legislatures were passing laws that govern everything from AI to social media to the right to repair. Many of these laws, alongside rules passed in past years, take effect in 2026 — either right now or in the coming months.
    
    As of January 1st, Americans should have the right to crypto ATM refunds in Colorado, wide-ranging electronics repairs in Colorado and Washington, and AI system transparency in California, among other things. But a last-minute court ruling offered a reprieve from one high-profile state law: Texas’ App Store-based age verification rule.

    A federal judge blocked a Texas law requiring mobile app stores to verify users’ ages from taking effect on January 1st.
    
    In an [order](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/71664632/65/computer-communications-industry-association-v-paxton/) granting a preliminary injunction on the Texas App Store Accountability Act (SB 2420), Judge Robert Pitman wrote that the statute “is akin to a law that would require every bookstore to verify the age of every customer at the door and, for minors, require parental consent before the child or teen could enter and again when they try to purchase a book.” Pitman has not yet ruled on the merits of the case, but his decision to grant the preliminary injunction means he believes its defenders are unlikely to prevail in court.

    Australia is joining a wave of governments around the globe in regulating how kids spend their time online. On December 10th, most major social media platforms will boot children in the country under 16 from their services. Under the law, social platforms will also need to implement a “reasonable” age verification method there — while critics argue kids will get around it anyway.
    
    These changes stem from Australia’s Online Safety Amendment (Social Media Minimum Age) Bill, which passed in November 2024. They’re not only a big deal for Australian youth, but also a preview of a policy that’s been floated in numerous other places. Here’s a rundown of what the new law means and how it will affect each platform.

    Back in 2018, two years after the UK government [decided to implement mandatory hard age gates](https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/23/13726574/uk-porn-censorship-age-checks-laws) on adult websites, it floated an idea called the “porn pass.” The porn pass was a physical card you’d buy by handing over your ID to a brick-and-mortar shop attendant. It would contain authentication information that would act as a low-tech anonymization system, letting you verify you were over 18 years old online without entering personal details.

    Starting next year, Texas [will require](https://www.theverge.com/news/675259/texas-just-passed-the-age-verification-law-challenged-by-tim-cook) companies like Apple and Google to verify the ages of people that use their app stores, and [Apple shared today](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=btkirlj8) how it’s going to comply. Starting January 1st, 2026, anyone trying to make a new Apple Account must confirm if they are over 18, and any users under 18 must join a Family Sharing group. Parents and guardians will also be required to give their consent for users under 18 to download apps or to make in-app purchases.
    
    Developers will also have to make changes to comply with the law. Apple already offers a [Declared Age Range API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/declaredagerange/) that developers can implement to ask users their general age, and the API “will be updated in the coming months to provide the required age categories for new account users in Texas,” Apple says. Apple is also launching new APIs “later this year” that “will enable developers, when they determine a significant change is made to their app, to invoke a system experience to allow the user to request that parental consent be re-obtained.”

    Valve has started to comply with the UK’s Online Safety Act, by rolling out [a requirement](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/292B-3DA3-CFC8-97F6) for all Brits to verify their age with a credit card to access “mature content” pages and games on Steam. UK users won’t even be able to access the community hubs of mature content games unless a valid credit card is stored on a Steam account.
    
    While platforms like Reddit, Bluesky, and Discord have opted for [age verification checks using selfies](https://www.theverge.com/analysis/714587/uk-online-safety-act-age-verification-reactions), Valve is restricting its age checks to _just_ credit cards, according to a [support article](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/292B-3DA3-CFC8-97F6). “Among all age assurance mechanisms reviewed by Valve, this process preserves the maximum degree of user privacy,” says Valve. “Having the credit card stored as a payment method acts as an additional deterrent against circumventing age verification by sharing a single Steam user account among multiple persons.”

    Bluesky will block access from Mississippi IP addresses in response to a new state law requiring age verification and parental consent for underage users. The decision, [outlined in a blog post](https://bsky.social/about/blog/08-22-2025-mississippi-hb1126), will stand until courts decide the fate of the law.
    
    “Mississippi’s approach would fundamentally change how users access Bluesky,” says the post, in ways that rules like the UK’s Online Safety Act (which [Bluesky complies with](https://www.theverge.com/news/704468/bluesky-age-verification-uk-online-safety-act)) don’t. The law, HB 1126, “would block everyone from accessing the site — teens and adults — unless they hand over sensitive information, and once they do, the law in Mississippi requires Bluesky to keep track of which users are children.” In the UK, by contrast, users are only blocked from accessing direct messages and sensitive content unless they undergo a verification process using a third-party tool. “Building the required verification systems, parental consent workflows, and compliance infrastructure would require significant resources that our small team is currently unable to spare as we invest in developing safety tools and features for our global community, particularly given the law’s broad scope and privacy implications.”

    The Supreme Court will let Mississippi’s social media age verification law take effect while the case is being argued in court. In [an unsigned ruling on Thursday](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/25a97_5h25.pdf), the court declined to block the law after an emergency petition from trade association NetChoice. The order offers no explanation, but in a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that the law was “likely unconstitutional” — but that NetChoice hadn’t “sufficiently demonstrated” a risk of harm.
    
    The law, [HB 1126](https://legiscan.com/MS/text/HB1126/2024), requires social media platforms to verify the age of the person creating the account, while blocking users under 18 unless they have permission from a parent. It also states that social media sites must protect underage users from “harmful material” — such as sexual content and material related to self-harm — as well as restrict data collection.

The company says it will use the information a user has searched for or the types of YouTube videos they watch to determine their age.

    On July 25th, the UK became one of the first countries to widely implement age verification. Its Online Safety Act requires sites hosting porn and other content deemed “harmful” — including Reddit, Discord, Grindr, X, and Bluesky — to verify that users are over the age of 18. The early results have been chaotic. While many services have complied, some have pulled out of the country rather than face the risk and expense. Users have tricked the verification tools or bypassed them with VPNs. It’s just a taste of the issues that many other countries might face as they launch their own systems, and it’s a situation that privacy and security experts have long warned about — to little avail.
    
    Following a yearslong political push to make the internet safer for kids, age verification has started seeping into online spaces across the globe. Lawmakers in the US, Europe, Australia, and elsewhere have all passed age-gating rules, and platforms have begun to comply. The likely methods for verification are similar to those in the UK. Platforms typically ask users to either enter a payment card, upload a government-issued ID, take a selfie, or allow a platform to use their data (like account creation dates and user connections) to “estimate” their age. Most rely on third-party services: [Bluesky](https://www.theverge.com/news/704468/bluesky-age-verification-uk-online-safety-act) uses the Epic Games-owned Kids Web Services; [Reddit is working with Persona;](https://www.theverge.com/news/707125/reddit-age-verification-uk-online-safety) and Discord [has partnered with k-ID](https://www.theverge.com/news/650493/discord-age-verification-face-id-scan-experiment).

    Microsoft is starting to comply with the UK’s Online Safety Act by prompting Xbox players to verify their age today. The prompts will be shown to Xbox players who indicate they’re over the age of 18 and will be shown when you sign into an Xbox account in the UK. Microsoft says it’s also exploring bringing similar age verification tools to other countries in the future.
    
    To power the age verification in the UK, Microsoft is partnering with Yoti, which is one of the services that hasn’t fallen victim to the [_Death Stranding_ photo mode bypass](https://www.theverge.com/report/714402/uk-age-verification-bypass-death-stranding-reddit-discord).

    Enforcement of the UK’s new online safety rules [started on Friday](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/protecting-children/enforcement-programme-to-protect-children-from-encountering-pornographic-content-through-the-use-of-age-assurance), forcing a variety of platforms to roll out mandatory age verification tools for Brits. We already know that the age-gating checks are [easy to bypass with a VPN](https://www.theverge.com/analysis/713773/uk-online-safety-act-age-verification-bypass-vpn), but what we didn’t know is that the face scanning tools used by platforms like Reddit and Discord can also be easily bypassed with _Death Stranding_’s photo mode.
    
    Dany Sterkhov [alerted](https://x.com/DanySterkhov/status/1948665431633404170) the world to the Death Stranding bypass on Friday morning, and gamers have been using the photo mode and Sam Bridges to trick face scanning tools into accepting them as an adult all weekend. All you have to do is point your phone at your monitor with _Death Stranding_ open, activate the in-game photo mode, and then get Sam to look at the camera.

    Roblox is introducing a way to let trusted friends chat more freely among themselves, but it will require that they use a new age estimation tool to verify that they’re over 13.
    
    The platform is renaming Friends to Connections, and people can only use unfiltered text chat and the [Party social feature](https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/12/join-the-party-on-roblox) with a more exclusive group of “Trusted Connections.” With Trusted Connections, “inappropriate language like ‘butt-head’ and personally identifiable information are not filtered,” spokesperson Juliet Chaitin-Lefcourt tells _The Verge_.

    The European Union is [piloting a blueprint for age verification apps](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-makes-available-age-verification-blueprint) in Denmark, Greece, Spain, France, and Italy that aims to make it easier for online platforms to comply with rules that require them to protect minors. The [app prototype was announced on Monday](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1820) alongside guidelines that online platforms are recommended to adopt in order to comply with the bloc’s Digital Services Act (DSA).
    
    “Making sure our children and young people are safe online is of paramount importance to this Commission,” said EU tech policy leader Henna Virkkunen. “The guidelines on the protection of minors for online platforms, combined with the new age verification blueprint, are a huge step forward in this regard. Platforms have no excuse to be continuing practices that put children at risk.”
