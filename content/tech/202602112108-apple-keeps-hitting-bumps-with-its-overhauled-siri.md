Apple had been reportedly pushing to introduce some big changes to Siri with iOS 26.4, but now the company is planning to introduce them in later versions of iOS, including iOS 26.5 and iOS 27, [_Bloomberg_ reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-11/apple-s-ios-26-4-siri-update-runs-into-snags-in-internal-testing-ios-26-5-27).

Nearly a year ago, Apple delayed [planned features for Siri](https://www.theverge.com/news/626035/apple-delays-upgraded-siri-intelligence-longer-than-we-thought) that would let it understand your personal context and take action for you based on what’s on your screen. Apple had planned to launch those features with iOS 26.4, which is set to launch in March, but “​​testing uncovered fresh problems with the software,” according to _Bloomberg_. Apple has apparently told engineers to use iOS 26.5, scheduled for May, to test new Siri features instead.

For iOS 26.5, Apple is also testing a Perplexity-like web search tool and custom image generation, though they’ve been tested with iOS 26.4, too, _Bloomberg_ says.

Apple is also working on [an AI chatbot version of Siri](https://www.theverge.com/news/865172/apple-siri-ai-chatbot-chatgpt) that’s slated for launch with iOS 27, iPadOS, and macOS 27, [_Bloomberg_ reported in January](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-21/ios-27-apple-to-revamp-siri-as-built-in-iphone-mac-chatbot-to-fend-off-openai?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2OTAyNDk2NywiZXhwIjoxNzY5NjI5NzY3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUOFRXOVlLR0NURlUwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJDNEVEQ0FFMUZBMDU0MEJFQTI0QTlGMjExQzFFOTA4MCJ9.awOoIDGdEkCAvho8waoXR6VVVojI3jGvQHJeDjwcyrs). The plan is to reveal it in June at the Worldwide Developers Conference ahead of a September launch.
