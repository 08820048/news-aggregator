summary: "The first-gen AirTag remains a good tracker, though remember you’ll need to buy a separate accessory to attach it to your belongings. | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge With Apple’s second-gen AirTags now widely available, we’re already seeing inventory of the first-gen model begin to dwindle. Case in point? Amazon is no longer selling a single AirTag, and it’s unclear when — or if — the retailer will restock the first-gen model. Thankfully, you can still grab a four-pack of the first-gen location trackers for around $64 ($35 off) at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for Presidents Day, which is $2 shy of the bundle’s best price to date. If you just want one, you can also buy a single tracker at Walmart for $17 ($12 off). Apple AirTag (first-gen) Where to Buy: $99 $64 at Amazon (four-pack) $99 $64 at Walmart (four-pack) $99 $64.99 at Best Buy (four-pack) If you’re an iPhone owner, you’d be hard-pressed to find another tracker that’s as precise or as helpful as Apple’s AirTag. That’s because, like the second-gen model, the original can tap into Apple’s vast Find My network and leverage ultra wideband (UWB) technology. As a result, all you need to do is open up the Find My app on your phone and follow the on-screen arrows, sounds, or vibrations, which will guide you to the exact location of your item, even if it’s slipped between your car seats. That’s a level of precision many rival trackers, notably Tile’s, lack. On top of that, you also get access to a growing list of helpful software features. You can, for example, share an AirTag’s location with up to five people — which comes in handy for families while traveling — and you can even temporarily share an AirTag’s location with some airlines (including American Airlines and Virgin Atlantic). In addition to the aforementioned software perks, Apple’s handy location trackers are designed to last. The battery can last up to a year, and when it dies, you just need to swap in a standard CR2032 cell instead of replacing the tracker entirely. Each AirTag also carries an IP67 rating, meaning it can withstand both dust and a little bit of rain. There are some features you’ll miss out on if you go with the last-gen AirTag instead of the newer model, including an upgraded UWB chip that enables more precise location tracking. The second-gen version can also help you track items further away, and the speaker is 50 percent louder. But if you want to save some cash, the original is still one of the better trackers on the market and definitely worth picking up while you still can. Read our full AirTag (2021) review."
