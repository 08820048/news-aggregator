summary: "It’s tough not to gush about a 27-inch 1440p QD-OLED gaming monitor that costs under $400 (I’ve done it before!). AOC’s G-Sync-compatible model with a 240Hz refresh rate and a near-instant response time is down to $379.99 at Best Buy, which matches the lowest price I’ve ever seen for a model with these specs. This seems like a great entry-level OLED for your gaming desktop or laptop setup; it has a similar 111 pixels per inch (PPI) as its competitors, it has a three-year warranty that protects against burn-in from normal use (when you use its panel protection settings), and its 16:9 aspect ratio makes it ideal for PC and console gaming. AOC 27-inch QD-OLED gaming monitor (Q27G41ZDF) Where to Buy: $549.99 $379.99 at Best Buy The benefits of QD-OLED over IPS and TN panels commonly used in monitors are immediately obvious when you compare them side-by-side. QD-OLED offers deeper blacks (no more black appearing as hues of gray) and better contrast with more color and brightness accuracy. Games and movies will look better than ever. Google Docs? Not so much. Brightness and text clarity are areas where this tech falls behind; viewing a huge, white Google Doc on this and other OLEDs will make it appear somewhat dim. And, while newer OLED monitors boast clearer text thanks to vertical RGB stripes in their panels, you might notice some fringing around letters with this monitor (and many others on the market) if you look closely. Other Verge-approved deals Sony has discounted a fleet of PS5 games and accessories on its PS Direct site, and you’ll also find many of them on Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and GameStop. The most notable game discount that exists only on Sony’s site (for now, at least) is on Ghost of Yōtei, one of the PS5’s best exclusives from 2025. Previously $69.99, you can grab it on disc for $49.99 through March 10th. The third-person action game is set 300 years after the events of Ghost of Tsushima, and you control vengeance-seeking Atsu. As predicted, the title offers absolutely stunning graphics and the return of the previous game’s deep, satisfying fight system. Read our review. Woot is offering a stellar deal on Beats Studio Buds wireless earbuds that offer active noise cancellation, IPX4 protection against sweat, and compatibility with iOS and Android. Through Monday, February 23rd (or until supplies last), you can get the black or white model for $59.99, which is 60 percent off its original $149.95 price from when they debuted in 2021. We thought they were a so-so value in our original review, and its major cons (no wireless charging, noise cancellation that’s not as good as AirPods) were tough to settle for with a $150 price tag. These are a great buy at this discounted price. One of Best Buy’s deals of the day (lasting through Monday, February 23rd) is on a discounted bundle of high-end components for a desktop PC. If you’ve had your eyes set on AMD’s Ryzen 7 9850X3D processor (the successor to the best gaming CPU), you can grab it paired with 32GB of DDR5 RAM clocked at up to 6400MHz for $649.99. The CPU alone costs $499.99 at most retailers, so snagging this much speedy RAM for an extra $150 is great, considering how costly RAM has become these past few months."

No, not _that_ AOC. Also, _Ghost of Yōtei_ for PS5 is $20 off for the first time, and Beats Studio Buds are just $60.
