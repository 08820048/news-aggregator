summary: "Despite evidence to the contrary, not only are wired earbuds alive and well, they're enjoying a resurgence.

Even the Italian fashion brand Diesel has decided wired headphones are still cool and has launched a pair of earbuds it describes as being \"designed for fearless daily use.\" We're not entirely sure what that means, but these earbuds definitely look distinctly Diesel. The headphones aren't yet listed on the US version of Diesel's website, but you can find them on the company's UK site where they're priced at £89.95, or around $123. … Read the full story at The Verge."

Andrew Liszewski

is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.

Despite [evidence to the contrary](https://www.theverge.com/tech/852887/anker-soundcore-aerofit-2-pro-sleep-a30-special-boom-go-3i-bluetooth-headphones-earbuds-speaker), not only are wired earbuds alive and well, they’re enjoying a resurgence. Brands like [Belkin](https://www.theverge.com/news/768621/belkin-soundform-earbuds-anc-price-launch) and even respected headphone maker [Master & Dynamic](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314000/master-dynamic-headphones-wired-earphones-me05) now offer tethered earbuds again. Even the Italian fashion brand Diesel has decided wired headphones are still cool and has launched a pair of earbuds it describes as being “designed for fearless daily use.” We’re not entirely sure what that means, but these earbuds definitely look distinctly Diesel.

The headphones aren’t yet listed on the US version of Diesel’s website, but you can find them on the [company’s UK site](https://uk.diesel.com/en/earbuds/60458--wired-earbuds-silver/DP09850PHIN01.html) where they’re priced at £89.95, or around $123. That’s cheaper than Master & Dynamic’s $199 ME05 wired earbuds, but at least we [have a full run down of the tech inside M&D’s](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.masterdynamic.com%2Fproducts%2Fme05).

Diesel’s website doesn’t go into details about what drivers you’ll find inside its 60458 Wired Earbuds, but images reveal they’re designed to connect to mobile devices over USB-C, and include an inline remote with volume and playback controls, a microphone, and a sliding switch to mute the mic. The earbuds have a silver finish, but the chains wrapping the wires and attached charms (capitalizing on another trend) are actually made from less precious metals like aluminum and zinc.
