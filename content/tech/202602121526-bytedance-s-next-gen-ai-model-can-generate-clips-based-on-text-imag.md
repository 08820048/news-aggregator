Big Tech’s race to leapfrog the latest AI models continues with the launch of ByteDance’s next-gen video generator. In [a blog post](https://seed.bytedance.com/en/blog/seedance-2-0-%E6%AD%A3%E5%BC%8F%E5%8F%91%E5%B8%83), ByteDance – the China-based company behind TikTok – says [Seedance 2.0](https://seed.bytedance.com/en/seedance2_0) supports prompts that combine text, images, video, and audio.

The company claims it “delivers a substantial leap in generation quality,” offering improvements in generating complex scenes with multiple subjects and its ability to follow instructions. Users can refine their text prompts by feeding Seedance 2.0 up to nine images, three video clips, and three audio clips.

The model can generate up to 15-second clips with audio, while taking camera movement, visual effects, and motion into account. It can also reference text-based storyboards, according to ByteDance.

AI-powered video generation models have only gotten more advanced within the past year, with Google Veo 3 adding the ability to [generate audio-supported clips](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/673719/google-veo-3-ai-video-audio-sound-effects), and OpenAI [launching Sora 2](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/791290/openai-sora-ai-generated-video-hands-on) along with a new app that allows users to create videos with “hyperreal motion and sound.” The AI startup, [Runway, has also released a new version](https://www.theverge.com/news/834905/runway-ai-text-video-generator-launch) of its AI video model that it claims has “unprecedented” accuracy.

In one example shared by ByteDance, which shows two figure skaters performing a routine together, the company says Seedance 2.0 can “reliably perform a sequence of high-difficulty movements — including synchronized takeoffs, mid-air spins and precise ice landings — while strictly following real-world physical laws.”

Users on social media have already started showing off what the new tool can do, with one person posting an AI-generated video [with the likenesses](https://x.com/RuairiRobinson/status/2021394940757209134) of Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise in a cinematic fight sequence. _Deadpool_ writer Rhett Reese [reposted the video](https://x.com/RhettReese/status/2021446414337966098?s=20) with the comment, “I hate to say it. It’s likely over for us.”

Other posts demonstrate Seedance 2.0’s ability to [generate anime-style](https://x.com/TheReelRobot/status/2021342520731631871?s=20) clips, [cartoons](https://x.com/bstuartTI/status/2021327724762235203?s=20), [cinematic sci-fi scenes](https://x.com/Dheepanratnam/status/2021328074521051169?s=20), and [videos that look like](https://x.com/Mho_23/status/2020916495472054697?s=20) a content creator made them. It’s not clear what (if any) copyright protections Seedance 2.0 offers, as a quick search on X reveals a bunch of clips featuring characters from [_Dragon Ball Z_](https://x.com/NACHOS2D_/status/2020624444344213959?s=20), [_Family Guy_](https://x.com/aleenaamiir/status/2021900753955434844?s=20), [_Pokémon_](https://x.com/nasan_0422/status/2021066670668906615?s=20), and more.

For now, Seedance 2.0 is only available through ByteDance’s Dreamina AI platform and through its AI assistant, Doubao. It’s unclear whether it will make its way to TikTok — especially now that the app is under new ownership in the US.
