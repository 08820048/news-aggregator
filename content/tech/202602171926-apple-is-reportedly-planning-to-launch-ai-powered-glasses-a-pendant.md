Apple is pushing ahead with plans to launch its first pair of smart glasses, along with an AI-powered pendant and camera-equipped AirPods, [according to a report from _Bloomberg_’s Mark Gurman](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-17/apple-ramps-up-work-on-glasses-pendant-and-camera-airpods-for-ai-era). The three devices come with built-in cameras and will connect to the iPhone, allowing Siri to use “visual context to carry out actions,” _Bloomberg_ reports.

Apple is reportedly aiming to start production of its smart glasses in December, ahead of a 2027 launch. The new device will compete directly with Meta’s lineup of smart glasses and is rumored to feature speakers, microphones, and a high-resolution camera for taking photos and videos, in addition to another lens designed to enable AI-powered features.

The glasses won’t have a built-in display, but they will allow users to make phone calls, interact with Siri, play music, and “take actions based on surroundings,” such as asking about the ingredients in a meal, according to _Bloomberg_. Apple’s smart glasses could also help users identify what they’re seeing, reference landmarks when offering directions, and remind wearers to complete a task in specific situations, _Bloomberg_ reports.

The company is reportedly planning to develop the frames for the smart glasses in-house, instead of partnering with a third-party company like [Meta does with Ray-Ban](https://www.theverge.com/tech/787680/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-review-smart-glasses) and [Oakley](https://www.theverge.com/tech-accessory-review/716360/oakley-meta-hstn-limited-edition-review-smart-glasses-wearables). Prototypes of the glasses use a cable to connect to a battery pack and an iPhone, but _Bloomberg_ reports that “newer versions have the components embedded in the frame.” Apple reportedly wants to make its smart glasses stand out by offering a high-quality build and advanced camera technology. The company is still working on AI-powered smart glasses with a display, though their launch “remains many years away,” _Bloomberg_ says.

Apple’s plans for AI hardware don’t end there, as the company is expected to build upon its [Google Gemini-powered Siri upgrade](https://www.theverge.com/news/860521/apple-siri-google-gemini-ai-personalization) with [an AirTag-sized AI pendant](https://www.theverge.com/news/865212/apple-ai-pin-wearable-airtag-rumor) that people can either wear as a necklace or a pin. This device would “essentially serve as an always-on camera” for the iPhone and has a microphone for prompting Siri, _Bloomberg_ reports. The pendant, [which _The Information_ first reported on last month](https://www.theverge.com/news/865212/apple-ai-pin-wearable-airtag-rumor), is rumored to come with a built-in chip, but will mainly rely on the iPhone’s processing power. The device could arrive as early as next year, according to _Bloomberg_.

Apple could also launch upgraded AirPods this year, which Gurman [previously said could pair low-resolution cameras](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/25/24082760/apple-smart-glasses-airpods-cameras-smart-ring) with AI to analyze a wearer’s surroundings.
