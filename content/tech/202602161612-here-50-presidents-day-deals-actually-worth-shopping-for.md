summary: "Deals have been admittedly pretty dry since the holidays, but now that February is in full swing, we’re starting to see strong discounts return across a range of categories. In fact, thanks to Valentine’s Day, the Super Bowl, and — as of this week — Presidents Day, retailers are once again offering a slew of notable tech deals, making now a great time to shop if you’ve been holding off on making a larger purchase. Although the Super Bowl and V-Day have technically come and gone, plenty of discounts remain. A few have been rebranded for Presidents Day — including the discounts we recently saw on Sonos soundbars and speakers — but others are part of a new wave of limited-time deals, letting you save on OLED TVs, wireless earbuds, iPads, and other gadgets through the end of today, February 16th. Below, we’ve rounded up the best Presidents Day deals we’ve seen so far. As in previous years, we’ll continue updating this list with new picks throughout the remainder of the week. Headphone and earbud deals Shokz OpenFit Air The OpenFit Air feature a lightweight, open-ear design that allows you to remain aware of your surroundings. They’re well-suited for everyday use and the gym thanks to their IP55 water resistance rating, and feature relatively clear sound and a decent amount of bass despite their open build. Read our review. Where to Buy: $119.95 $79.99 at Best Buy You can currently buy the Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus at Best Buy for $149.99 ($50 off), which is just $10 more than their all-time low. The open-style earbuds boast wireless charging and support for Dolby Audio, but are otherwise nearly identical to the Shokz OpenFit 2, with one dedicated bass speaker and another for mids and highs. They don’t sound as clear as the OpenRun Pro 2, but they do sound better than the OpenFit Air and offer helpful onboard touch controls. The latest pair of AirPods Max are on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart for around $449 ($100 off), which is $50 shy of their best price to date. Apple’s stainless steel / aluminum headphones offer a high-end look few headphones can match, along with a natural-sounding transparency mode and some of the best noise cancellation available. They also play well with other Apple devices, providing Apple users access to automatic device switching, head-tracking spatial audio, built-in Find My support, and other notable features. Read our original review. Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 The OpenRun Pro 2 are Shokz’s best bone conduction headphones yet, with better sound and more bass than their predecessor. Our reviewer Victoria Song praised their cozy fit as well as their USB-C charging (goodbye, proprietary charger!). Read our review. Where to Buy: $179.95 $149.99 at Best Buy The Sonos Ace are currently available from Amazon and Best Buy for $319 ($80 off), which is the best price we’ve seen since they dropped to $249 in December. Sonos’ first pair of headphones deliver great ANC and sound, but what really makes them stand out is that you can easily swap TV audio from a compatible Sonos soundbar to your headphones for private listening. Read our review. You can buy a pair of the noise-canceling AirPods Pro 3 for $209.99 ($40 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart, which is about $10 more than their most recent sale price. Apple’s premium earbuds boast the best ANC and sound quality of any AirPods to date, along with a built-in heart-rate sensor that allows you to use them as a fitness tracker. The wireless earbuds also improve upon the prior model with an additional ear tip size (XXS) and a more robust IP57 rating for sweat and water resistance. Read our review. Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 Significantly smaller and lighter than their predecessors, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 also offer stronger noise cancellation, a crystal clear transparency mode, and lengthy battery life. Read our review. Where to Buy: $229 $179 at Amazon $229 $179 at Walmart Nothing Headphone 1 Nothing’s first pair of over-ear headphones feature a retro transparent design and high-end features like active noise cancellation, spatial audio with head tracking, and plush ear pads. They also feature a paddle button that allows you to control music playback. Read our review. Where to Buy: $299 $239 at Amazon Speaker deals Sonos Era 100 Sonos’ Era 100 smart speaker is a replacement for the older Sonos One, utilizing two tweeters (left and right) and one larger woofer. In addition to Wi-Fi, the Era 100 also supports Bluetooth audio and line-in playback via an optional 3.5mm to USB-C adapter. Where to Buy: $219 $179 at Amazon $219 $179 at Sonos $219 $179 at Best Buy The Sonos Era 300 is also on sale for $379 ($100 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and directly from Sonos, which is $20 shy of its best price to date. The fantastic smart speaker delivers more powerful, Dolby Atmos-enabled sound than the Era 100, allowing for room-filling spatial audio. It also supports Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and line-in audio via USB-C (with Sonos’ optional adapter), as well as voice controls via Amazon Alexa. Read our review. JBL Authentics 200 The JBL Authentics 200 is one of the first smart speakers with simultaneous Google Assistant and Alexa support. The small, ‘70s-style speaker produces great sound for its size, and you don’t need to toggle a setting to use your preferred virtual assistant. Where to Buy: $349.95 $199.95 at Amazon $349.99 $199.95 at Best Buy You can buy the JBL Charge 6 at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart for $159.95 ($40 off), which is $10 shy of its lowest price to date. The rugged Bluetooth speaker builds on its predecessor with improved sound, a more robust IP68 water resistance rating, and up to 28 hours of continuous playback on a single charge. It also supports lossless audio with compatible services like Spotify, and features a removable strap so you can carry it around easily. As an added bonus, it even doubles as a power bank. The tiny JBL Clip 5 is available from Amazon, Best Buy, and JBL for $59.95 ($20 off), which is $10 more than its best-ever price. The Clip 5 offers up to 12 hours of battery life on a single charge while delivering surprisingly powerful sound for its size, which you can adjust using JBL’s companion app. It also features an IP67 rating and a built-in carabiner, so you can clip it to your bag, handlebars, or anything else you can latch it to. Soundbar, TV, and streaming deals Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus The latest version of Amazon’s zippy Fire TV Stick 4K streams in 4K resolution, as its name suggests, and features support for Wi-Fi 6, Dolby Atmos / Vision, and HDR10 Plus. Where to Buy: $49.99 $29.99 at Target $49.99 $29.99 at Amazon $49.99 $29.99 at Best Buy LG B5 OLED TV LG’s budget B5 is a great way to get OLED picture quality for less. It features support for both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, along with a 120Hz panel and four HDMI 2.1 ports for hooking up the latest gaming consoles. It also runs LG’s webOS platform, supports Amazon Alexa, and provides easy access to a wide range of popular streaming apps. Where to Buy: $1499.99 $899.99 at Best Buy (55-inch) $2999.99 $1499.99 at Best Buy (77-inch) $1299.99 $599.99 at Best Buy (48-inch) LG C5 OLED TV LG’s midrange C5 TV is an excellent way to get OLED performance without paying top dollar. It has a good amount of brightness, excellent color accuracy out of the box, and great gaming features, including a max 144Hz refresh rate. Where to Buy: $1999.99 $1046.99 at Best Buy (55-inch) $1999.99 $1046.99 at Amazon (55-inch) $1999.99 $1199.99 at LG (55-inch) LG’s high-end G5 OLED TV is on sale in the 83-inch configuration for about $5,296.99 ($1,200 off) at Amazon and LG’s online storefront (where you’ll also receive $200 off one of several soundbars). LG’s step-up OLED offers all the features of the midrange C5, but it’s noticeably brighter, with a higher maximum refresh rate of 165Hz. It also features a more powerful chip, enabling better image processing and upscaling, so lower-res content looks sharper and more detailed. If you’re looking for a high-end soundbar, the Sonos Arc Ultra is down to $899 ($200 off) — $20 shy of its best-ever price — at Amazon, Best Buy, and Sonos’ online storefront. The Arc Ultra is more powerful than the Beam and better suited for larger spaces, largely thanks to its upward-firing Dolby Atmos drivers, which help create a more immersive, theater-like experience. It also builds on the last-gen model with Bluetooth support, deeper bass response, and clearer, more defined dialogue. Read our review. Sonos Beam (second-gen) The Sonos Beam (second-gen) is a compact soundbar that supports Dolby Atmos and can stream music from a plethora of services. Read our review. Where to Buy: $499 $369 at Amazon $499 $369 at Best Buy $499 $369 at Sonos Sony Bravia 8 II OLED TV The Bravia 8 II was chosen as the “king of TV” by a panel of judges (including The Verge’s own Nilay Patel) in Value Electronics’ 2025 shootout.

Where to Buy: $3299.99 $2698 at Amazon (65-inch) $3299.99 $2699.99 at Best Buy (65-inch) $3299.99 $2699.99 at Sony (65-inch) Smartwatch and fitness tracker deals Apple Watch Series 11 Although the Apple Watch Series 11 is the same size as its predecessor, it features a 5G cellular modem, a display that Apple claims is twice as durable, and slightly improved battery life. Read our review. Where to Buy: $399 $299 at Amazon (42mm) $429 $329 at Amazon (46mm) $399 at Walmart (42mm) Amazfit Active 2 The Amazfit Active 2 delivers outsized value for the price.

The Charge 6 is our favorite Fitbit, one that combines several notable health features — including an FDA-cleared EKG reader and blood oxygen sensors — with built-in GPS and an NFC chip so you can use Google Wallet. You can also pair it with select gym equipment via Bluetooth and get turn-by-turn directions via Google Maps. Read our review. Fitbit Ace LTE The Ace LTE sports some of the same hardware found on the Google Pixel Watch 2 and a variety of step-activated games, which can help motivate your child to keep moving. It also offers calling, messaging, and location sharing when you sign up for a monthly or annual data plan. Where to Buy: $179.99 $99.95 at Amazon $179.99 $99.99 at Google Apple Watch Ultra 2 The rugged Apple Watch Ultra 2 comes in one size: 49mm. It offers a large, bright display along with long battery life and excellent performance. It sports Apple’s last-gen S9 SiP, too, allowing you to take advantage of Apple’s newer double tap feature. Read our review. Where to Buy: $799 $549 at Best Buy (with Ocean Band) $799 $549 at Best Buy (with Alpine Loop) $799 $549 at Best Buy (with Trail Loop) Smart home deals Echo Dot Max The Echo Dot Max features a flat design and a redesigned sound system, which delivers nearly three times the bass as its predecessor. It also offers improved conversation detection and better noise filtering, thanks to Amazon’s new AZ3 chip. Read our review. Where to Buy: $99.99 $79.99 at Amazon $99.99 $79.99 at Best Buy $99.99 $79.99 at Target Aura Aspen The Aura Aspen digital frame lets you upload photos from anywhere using an accompanying companion app, various cloud services, or email. Its 12-inch LCD display features slim bezels, a 4:3 aspect ratio, and an anti-glare screen designed to mimic the look of real photos. Where to Buy: $229 $199 at Amazon $229 $199 at Aura $229.99 $199.99 at Best Buy The second-gen Blink Mini is on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for $23.99 ($16 off), or just $6 more than its lowest price to date. The basic 1080p security camera is a solid pick if you want an affordable way to keep an eye on your home. It offers improved video and audio quality over its predecessor, along with USB-C power and a wider field of view, while still providing essential features like two-way audio, motion alerts, and an adjustable design. It’s primarily designed for indoor use, but you can also use it outside when you buy it with a weather-resistant power adapter for $33.98 ($16 off). The latest Blink Video Doorbell is on sale with a Sync Module Core for $35.99 ($34 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target, which is $5 shy of its all-time low. The terrific budget doorbell boasts 1440p resolution and a 150-degree field of view with a 1:1 aspect ratio, meaning you get a much wider view of your porch than before. You also get all the essential features found on the last-gen model, including motion detection, night vision, and the ability to hardwire it. Echo Show 11 The Echo Show 11 features an 11-inch screen and 1080p resolution. It includes Alexa Plus and can be used as a smart home hub, supporting Thread, Matter, and Zigbee smart home protocols.

Where to Buy: $299.99 $254.99 at Amazon $299.99 $254.99 at Best Buy $299.99 $254.99 at The Home Depot As part of eBay’s ongoing Presidents Day sale, you can grab a refurbished Eufy X10 Pro Omni with a two-year warranty for $279.99 (which is $620 less than buying it new) using code LONGWKND20. The X10 Pro Omni is a powerful robot vacuum / mop hybrid, with dual oscillating brushes and 8,000Pa of suction. Its all-in-one dock can automatically empty the dustbin, refill the water tank, and dry the mop pads, while the onboard water reservoir lets it clean for longer stretches before needing to dock. If you don’t need a robot vacuum that can sweep your baseboards or empty its own bin, the Eufy 11S Max is on sale at Amazon for $139.99 ($140 off), which is one of its better prices to date. The entry-level robovac isn’t the smartest option available, but it’s at least aware enough not to bump into walls or tumble down stairs. The 11S Max offers good carpet and hard surface cleaning with relative quietness, too, and its 600ml bin is roomy enough to go through several cleanings before it needs to be dumped. Mill Food Recycler (second-gen) Mill’s latest Food Recycler works overnight to shrink your food scraps by 80 percent and convert them into food grounds, which you can then use for gardening or dispose of responsibly. It has a 6.5-liter capacity, which Mill says takes roughly four weeks to fill, and eliminates most odors. Where to Buy: $999 $849.15 at Mill Gaming deals Battlefield 6 Battlefield 6 is the best-selling title in the franchise’s history. The military first-person shooter puts a bigger focus on environmental destruction than previous entries, adding a level of chaos that helps make its large-scale, multiplayer battles feel more engaging. Where to Buy: $69.99 $39.88 at Amazon (PlayStation 5) $69.99 $39.99 at Best Buy (PlayStation 5) $69.99 $39.99 at Best Buy (Xbox Series X) Star Wars Outlaws Star Wars Outlaws is an original open-world adventure set in the vast universe of the iconic film series. It stars Kay Vess, a protagonist looking to steal from criminal overlords to gain her freedom. Read our review.

Set in feudal Japan, the open-world third-person action game follows two protagonists — a shinobi assassin and a powerful samurai — as they navigate political unrest and power struggles. It’s a challenging, thoughtful game that offers a good balance of action and stealth. Read our review. Amazon and Best Buy are selling a physical copy of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X for an all-time low of $34.99 ($25 off). The remake updates the original 1988 turn-based RPG with HD-2D visuals, modern gameplay improvements, and small yet helpful tweaks, including clearer maps. The welcome quality-of-life upgrades, as well as the additional story elements, make it a great entry point for newcomers, even though it’s technically the third game in the series. Read our review. The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening brings back the classic adventure from the original GameBoy to experience on the Nintendo Switch with an extremely cute art style. Read our review. Where to Buy: $59.99 $39.88 at Walmart Borderlands 4 Borderlands 4 is an amusing looter-shooter that supports solo play or up to four-player co-op. Players take on the role of one of four Vault Hunters searching for mythical vaults while trying to take on the planet’s immoral dictator. It’s full of great characters and has the mindlessly fun vibe of a dumb action movie. Read our review. Where to Buy: $69.99 $44.99 at Best Buy (PlayStation 5) $69.99 $44.99 at Amazon (PlayStation 5) $69.99 $41.99 at Amazon (Xbox Series X / S) Other great Presidents Day deals Anker Nano Charger (45W, Smart Display, 180° Foldable) Anker’s latest single-port USB-C charger offers up to 45W of power, foldable prongs, and a front-facing “smart display” that lets you see the charge level, power flow, and other useful information at a glance. Where to Buy: $39.99 $29.98 at Anker (with code WSPDV2QRVDN7) $39.99 $29.98 at Amazon (with Prime) iPad Mini (2024) The seventh-gen iPad Mini comes with Apple’s A17 Pro chip and support for Apple Intelligence. It’s also compatible with the Apple Pencil Pro and offers faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds. Read our review. Where to Buy: $499 $399 at Amazon (128GB, Wi-Fi) $499 $399 at Best Buy (128GB, Wi-Fi) $599 $499 at Amazon (256GB, Wi-Fi) The latest iPad is on sale with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage for around $299 ($50 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. While it doesn’t support Apple Intelligence like its pricier siblings (or the rumored next-gen iPad), it’s a solid tablet for everyday use. It offers snappy performance for light productivity tasks and even casual gaming, and it features the largest display ever offered on an entry-level iPad, making it even better for streaming, reading, and other tasks. Read our review. The Dyson Airwrap i.d. is available for $499.99 ($150 off) from Best Buy and Dyson. Dyson’s first smart hair styler can automatically adjust heat, timing, and airflow based on your hair profile, letting you dry, curl, wave, smooth, volumize, or manage flyaways much more easily. The special edition — which is what’s on sale here — also includes a presentation case and a detangling comb. Apple AirTag (first-gen) Apple’s first-gen AirTags can help you find your lost items with their UWB technology. You’ll get the best compatibility with an iPhone, though Apple released an Android app to detect an AirTag’s location if one seems to be following you. Read our original review. Where to Buy: $29 $17 at Walmart $99 $64 at Amazon (four-pack) $99 $64 at Walmart (four-pack) Lego Fortnite Battle Bus Lego’s brick-ified Battle Bus is a terrific homage to the only battle royale game that seemingly has a chance in 2026. The 954-piece set features a detachable balloon, nine Fortnite-inspired minifigures (including the iconic Peely), and plenty of Slurp Juice to go around. Where to Buy: $99.99 $79.99 at Amazon $99.99 at Best Buy $99.99 $79.99 at Target You can buy the DJI Osmo Mobile 7P for around $99 ($20 off), its lowest price to date, at Amazon and Best Buy. The three-axis smartphone gimbal physically stabilizes your phone, so you can take clearer selfies and videos. It also comes with a built-in tripod, a telescoping extension arm, and a built-in camera that automatically follows you, starts and stops recordings, and adjusts the framing when you perform a hand gesture. The Nespresso VertuoPlus, a Verge favorite, is currently on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for $101.39 (about $68 off), which is easily the best price we’ve seen this year. It’s a shame that the versatile espresso machine relies on Vertuo pods rather than Nespresso’s cheaper options, though we do admire its one-button operation and the fact that it can also brew an 8-ounce cup of coffee when needed. Coway Airmega AP-1512HH Mighty air purifier Coway’s surprisingly efficient Airmega AP-1512HH Mighty is compact enough to fit in any corner of your home and offers a three-stage filtration system, including a true HEPA filter. Where to Buy: $239.99 $154.99 at Amazon (white) $239.99 $154.99 at Amazon (black) $239.99 $154.99 at Coway Levoit’s Core 300-P is currently on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for around $84.95 ($15 off), nearly matching its best price to date. The basic air purifier — which can cover up to 1,074 square feet — uses replaceable HEPA filters and runs quietly as it reduces dust and odors; you can also opt for a special filter that removes pet allergens. Update, February 16th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and remove several expired deals."

Deals have been admittedly pretty dry since the holidays, but now that February is in full swing, we’re starting to see strong discounts return across a range of categories. In fact, thanks to Valentine’s Day, the Super Bowl, and — as of this week — Presidents Day, retailers are once again offering a slew of notable tech deals, making now a great time to shop if you’ve been holding off on making a larger purchase.

LG’s midrange C5 TV is an excellent way to get OLED performance without paying top dollar. It has a good amount of brightness, excellent color accuracy out of the box, and great gaming features, including a max 144Hz refresh rate.

-   LG’s high-end **G5 OLED TV** is on sale in the 83-inch configuration for about $5,296.99 ($1,200 off) at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/LG-Upscaling-Filmmaker-Orchestra-OLED65G5WUA/dp/B0DYQ1R8YS?tag=theverge02-20) and [LG’s online storefront](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-oled83g5wua-oled-4k-tv) (where you’ll also receive [$200 off one of several soundbars](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.lg.com/us/promotions/soundbar-bundle-savings)). LG’s step-up OLED offers all the features of the midrange C5, but it’s noticeably brighter, with a higher maximum refresh rate of 165Hz. It also features a more powerful chip, enabling better image processing and upscaling, so lower-res content looks sharper and more detailed.

The Arc Ultra is more powerful than the Beam and better suited for larger spaces, largely thanks to its upward-firing Dolby Atmos drivers, which help create a more immersive, theater-like experience. It also builds on the last-gen model with Bluetooth support, deeper bass response, and clearer, more defined dialogue.

Players take on the role of one of four Vault Hunters searching for mythical vaults while trying to take on the planet’s immoral dictator.
