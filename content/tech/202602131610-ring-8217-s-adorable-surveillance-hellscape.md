You can watch Ring’s recent Super Bowl ad and see a cute story about dogs being reunited with their families. You can also watch the very same ad and [see the seeds being planted](https://www.theverge.com/tech/876866/ring-search-party-super-bowl-ad-online-backlash) for a massively connected, utterly ubiquitous surveillance system that will end the concept of privacy forever. Maybe you can even see both at the same time.

On [this episode of _The Vergecast_](https://pod.link/vergecast), Nilay and David talk about the Super Bowl ad that worried so many people, why Ring would build a feature like this in the first place, and whether all this surveillance is a feature or a bug. Given that the Ring controversy happened the same week as Google recovered [important (and supposedly deleted) footage](https://www.theverge.com/tech/877235/nancy-guthrie-google-nest-cam-video-storage) from Nancy Guthrie’s Nest camera, it seems worth debating what we really want from our security cameras, and what “security” even means in this context.

After that, the hosts turn to yet another week of chaos in the AI industry. A number of important people at companies like Anthropic and OpenAI are quitting their jobs, and issuing dire warnings about the power and peril of AI on the way out. What are we to make of [the end of OpenAI’s Mission Alignment team](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/877208/openai-reportedly-disbanded-its-mission-alignment-team), or the Anthropic safety leader who [wrote that “the world is in peril?”](https://x.com/MrinankSharma/status/2020881722003583421) There are even tech employees worried about what the advent of chatbot advertising will do to your data, your conversations with AI, and the world. We try to put all the pieces together, and figure out what’s really worth being worried about going forward.

Finally, in the lightning round, it’s time for an extra long installment of Brendan Carr is a Dummy ([theme music by Michiel Vanhoudt](https://bsky.app/profile/mvanhoudt.bsky.social/post/3meieueer2s2v)), the [latest Siri delays](https://www.theverge.com/tech/877494/apple-siri-ai-overhaul-ios-personalized), the [forthcoming Ferrari EV](https://www.theverge.com/transportation/875799/ferrari-luce-jony-ive-interior-design-photos), and more.
