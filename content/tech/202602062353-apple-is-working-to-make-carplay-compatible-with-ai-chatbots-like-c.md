Apple CarPlay users may soon be able to talk to their favorite AI chatbot. Apple is reportedly working on how to support AI chatbot apps within CarPlay, according to Bloomberg, which cites anonymous sources. Apple CarPlay is an app that runs on an iPhone and wirelessly communicates with a vehicle’s infotainment system. It projects some of the apps found on a user’s phone onto the vehicle’s infotainment display. Drivers are able to interact with these apps, including Apple Music, messaging, and navigation, through its voice assistant Siri. Apple’s next-generation CarPlay Ultra goes a step further, including the central touchscreen display and digital dashboard located right in front of the driver, and gives users control of certain vehicle settings. This latest move would theoretically bring Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT into the car, and at the risk of putting its own Siri assistant in the back seat.
