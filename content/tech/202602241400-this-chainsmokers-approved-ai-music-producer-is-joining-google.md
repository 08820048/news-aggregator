ProducerAI, an AI-powered music-making platform, is joining Google. As part of the deal, Google will fold ProducerAI under the Labs umbrella and power the tool with a preview version of its new [Lyria 3 music-making AI model](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/880584/google-gemini-ai-music-maker-lyria-3-beta).

ProducerAI is a music-making platform that allows users to work with an AI agent to generate sounds, workshop lyrics, remix songs, and even create new instruments based on a prompt. The platform [launched in July 2025](http://producer.ai/) as a successor to the AI music-making tool Riffusion, and initially used the startup’s own AI model to help you generate songs and tweak existing ones. Seth Forsgren, the cofounder and CEO of ProducerAI, tells _The Verge_ the team is “just scratching the surface of what these models are going to be able to do once we harness everything that Google brings to the table.”

“You can talk to this producer like you would a Gemini model, ask questions, and learn about a new genre,” Forsgren says. “As soon as you want to, you can start actually creating, and you can craft things with these instruments and make a song and iterate on it.”

According to Elias Roman, the director of product management at Google Labs, the key difference between ProducerAI and other AI music-making platforms is the conversation with the platform’s built-in agent. “It’s not a tool that you put in your prompt, roll the slot machine, and something will come out,” Roman says. “The reality is that’s not how good music is made … and ProducerAI was really made for the back-and-forths that play out over time.”

In addition to using Lyria 3 for music generation and Gemini for its chat interface, ProducerAI will leverage Google’s [image-generation model, Nano Banana](https://www.theverge.com/report/837971/google-nano-banana-pro-realistic-phone-photos), to create album art, and [Veo to generate AI-powered music videos](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/673719/google-veo-3-ai-video-audio-sound-effects). “All of these models are coordinated by your producer, so you just get to focus on what you want to create, and the model does the coordination for you,” Roman says. Google will also embed its [SynthID watermark into ProducerAI’s output](https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24155927/google-ai-synthid-watermark-text-video-io), which flags AI-generated text, videos, images, and audio.

The team behind ProducerAI has collaborated with The Chainsmokers, Lecrae, Anjulie, and other artists to develop the platform. Even as the [music industry begins to embrace AI](https://www.theverge.com/tech/825382/ai-music-streaming-deal-klay-umg-sony-warner) tools for song creation — like those offered by [ElevenLabs, Udio](https://www.theverge.com/news/864843/elevenlabs-ai-music-eleven-album-release), and [Suno](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/786349/suno-ai-music-generator-v5-review) — many artists have [expressed frustration with AI clones](https://www.theverge.com/report/844454/musicians-tired-of-ai-clones). Bandcamp has even [banned AI-generated music](https://www.theverge.com/news/861794/bandcamp-ban-ai-music) from its platform entirely, while Deezer has [developed technology to detect](https://www.theverge.com/news/870186/deezer-ai-music-detection-commercially-available) and deprioritize it.

The press release includes a quote from The Chainsmokers’ Alex Pall saying that the duo is “so grateful” to see how ProducerAI evolves. “It’s truly crafted around the musician’s experience,” Pall adds.

ProducerAI will remain a standalone service after joining Labs, adding yet another platform to Google’s growing AI toolset. Last week, [Google put Lyria 3 in the Gemini app](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/880584/google-gemini-ai-music-maker-lyria-3-beta), allowing users to generate 30-second tracks using prompts with text, images, and videos.

Users can access ProducerAI for free with a limited number of credits. There’s also an $8 / month starter plan that offers 3,000 credits to create around 600 songs, along with a $24 / month Plus and $64 / month Member subscriptions with the ability to generate more music. ProducerAI is now available in more than 250 countries, and is available to try now [from its website](http://www.producer.ai/) on desktop or mobile devices.
