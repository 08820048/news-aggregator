Over the past few months, several countries have announced plans to restrict social media access for children and teens. Australia [became the first](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/07/as-australia-bans-social-media-for-kids-under-16-age-assurance-tech-is-in-the-spotlight/) to implement such measures at the end of last year, setting a precedent that other countries are now closely watching. 

Australia’s regulations, along with other countries’ proposals, aim to reduce the pressures and risks that young users may face on social media, which include cyberbullying, addiction, mental health issues, and exposure to predators. 

Of course, there are concerns about privacy regarding invasive age verification and excessive government intervention. Critics, including [Amnesty Tech](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/12/australia-social-media-ban-for-children-and-young-people-an-ineffective-quick-fix-that-will-not-prevent-online-harms/), have said such bans are ineffective and that they ignore the realities of younger generations. Despite this, many nations are moving ahead with proposed legislation. 

We’ve compiled a list of countries that are considering or have already moved forward with bans on social media for young users.

## Australia

Australia became the world’s first country to [ban social media](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyp9d3ddqyo) for children under 16 in December 2025. The ban blocks children from using Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube, Reddit, Twitch, and Kick. It notably doesn’t include WhatsApp or YouTube Kids. 

The Australian government has said these social media companies must take steps to keep children off their services. Companies that fail to comply may face penalties of up to $49.5 million AUD ($34.4 million USD).

The government says these platforms should use multiple verification methods to ensure that people using their services are older than 16. It also notes that they can’t rely on users simply entering their own age.

## **Denmark**

Denmark is [set to ban](https://apnews.com/article/denmark-social-media-ban-australia-1e96a3df3276cc2033a6f04effb89f51) social media platforms for children under 15. The Danish government announced in November 2025 that it had secured support from three governing coalition parties and two opposition parties in parliament for the ban.

The government’s plans could become law as soon as mid-2026, according to the Associated Press. The Danish digital affairs ministry is also launching a “digital evidence” app that includes age verification tools that may be used as part of the ban.

## **France**

In late January, French lawmakers [passed a bill](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/27/france-social-media-ban-under-15s) that would ban social media for kids under 15. President Emmanuel Macron has supported the measure as a way to protect children from excessive screen time. 

The bill still has to get through the country’s Senate before a final vote in the lower house.

## **Germany**

In early February, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s conservatives discussed a [proposal to bar](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/germanys-cdu-weighs-social-media-age-curbs-under-16s-2026-02-06/) children under 16 from using social media, Reuters reported. However, there were signs that his center-left coalition partners were hesitant to support an outright ban.

## **Greece**

Greece is said to be close to announcing a social media ban for children under 15, Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/greece-soon-announce-social-media-ban-children-under-15-government-source-says-2026-02-03/) in early February.   

## **Malaysia** 

The Malaysian government said in November 2025 that it plans to [ban social media](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/asia/malaysia-says-plans-ban-social-media-users-under-16-starting-2026-rcna245562) for children under 16. The country plans to implement the ban this year. 

## **Slovenia**

Slovenia is [drafting legislation](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/slovenia-preparing-law-ban-access-social-media-minors-under-15-2026-02-05/) to prohibit children under 15 from accessing social media, the country’s deputy prime minister announced in early February. The government wants to regulate social networks where content is shared, citing platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat, and Instagram.

## **Spain**

Spain’s prime minister announced in early February that the country [plans to ban](https://www.reuters.com/world/spain-hold-social-media-executives-accountable-illegal-hateful-content-2026-02-03/) social media for children under the age of 16. The ban still needs parliamentary approval. The Spanish government is also seeking to create a law that would make social media executives personally accountable for hate speech on their platforms

## **UK**

The United Kingdom is [weighing a ban](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgm4xpyxp7lo) on social media for children under 16. The government says it will consult parents, young people, and civil society for their views to determine whether a ban would be effective. 

It will also consider whether to require social media companies to limit or remove features that drive compulsive use, such as endless scrolling.
