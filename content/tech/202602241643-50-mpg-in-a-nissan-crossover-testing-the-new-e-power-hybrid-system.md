I noticed the engine running just twice. One was at wide-open throttle, and the other was when the engine was likely operating at higher rpms to help charge the battery. That latter instance was also when I noticed the most harshness from the engine, although it’s one of the smoothest gasoline-supported powertrains I’ve driven.

The E-Power system will operate in full-EV mode at the press of a button, but at full throttle, the engine will still kick in.

## What needs work?

Since an electric motor powers the wheels, I would prefer the system to be more responsive when you put your foot down. Electric motors respond nearly instantly. In a gas car, there’s usually a delay with a downshift and engine spin-up. This E-Power Qashqai behaves more like a gas car than an EV, even in the sport setting. I think this powertrain is a great opportunity to show new customers what electrification can do, and a little bit more snappiness would go a long way into articulating that E-Power can be sporty if the driver wants it to be.

The Qashqai had no problems getting up to highway speeds, and acceleration at higher speeds—in an overtake situation, for example—remained consistent. Again, it’s not a sports car or rocket ship, but it can get out of its own way easily enough.

During my loop, the computer indicated 47.7 mpg (4.93 L/100km) in mixed driving. Being left-hand-drive cars, that means they weren’t British imperial gallons. That’s a pretty great fuel efficiency number. In warmer conditions, it should easily exceed 50 mpg (4.7 L/100 km) in many driving scenarios.

Is that directly translatable to the upcoming Rogue E-Power? Somewhat. While the powertrain will be the same, the Rogue will be a little larger and heavier. Speccing all-wheel drive will further increase weight and add losses to the drivetrain. So a 50 mpg Rogue might be a stretch.

If Nissan prices the Rogue E-Power well, and the car delivers on the increase in economy that I’ve seen here, it could be a very compelling product in Nissan’s showrooms for buyers who haven’t had a great hybrid offering from the company before.

As long as Nissan sorts out the brake calibration.
