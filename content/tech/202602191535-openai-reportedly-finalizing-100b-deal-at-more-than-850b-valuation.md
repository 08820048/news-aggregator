OpenAI is nearing a deal to raise more than $100 billion at a valuation that could exceed $850 billion, [Bloomberg reports,](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-19/openai-funding-on-track-to-top-100-billion-with-latest-round) citing sources familiar with the matter. 

The deal comes as the ChatGPT-maker burns through cash as it inches towards profitability. To that end, OpenAI has said it has started testing [ads in ChatGPT](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/09/chatgpt-rolls-out-ads/) for free users, a gamble that could lead to more revenue or could send users running from the platform. 

Apparently investors think it’s worth the risk if they’re valuing the company $20 billion higher than the $830 billion valuation initially expected. The company’s pre-money value will remain at $730 billion, per Bloomberg’s source. 

The first tranches of funding are reportedly coming from the usual suspects: Amazon (already in talks to invest [up to $50 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-29/amazon-in-talks-to-invest-up-to-50-billion-in-openai-wsj-says)), SoftBank (gearing up for [$30 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-28/softbank-in-talks-to-invest-30-billion-more-in-openai-wsj-says)), Nvidia (close to investing [$20 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/nvidia-nears-deal-to-invest-20-billion-in-openai-round)), and Microsoft. VC firms and sovereign wealth funds are expected to close later, potentially bringing the total amount raised higher.
