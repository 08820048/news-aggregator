Donald Trump [threatened](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116111073840858395) that there would be “consequences” for Netflix if it didn’t [fire](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-21/trump-threatens-netflix-with-consequences-over-rice-board-seat) board member Susan Rice. Rice served in both the Obama and Biden administrations, and recently appeared on [Preet Bharara’s podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZql8uCboYY), where she said corporations that “take a knee to Trump” are going to be “caught with more than their pants down. They are going to be held accountable.”

Right-wing influencer and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer was quick to jump on the appearance and accused Rice of “threatening half the country with weaponized government and political retribution.” She also pointed out that [Netflix](https://www.theverge.com/streaming/874655/netflix-warner-bros-republican-culture-war-ted-sarandos-hearing), whose board Rice is on, is trying to merge with Warner Bros.

This, of course, plays to one of Donald Trump’s favorite narratives, that he is somehow an aggrieved victim of political persecution. That it’s Democrats, not he, who have weaponized the government and the Department of Justice against perceived enemies. Trump [pounced](https://deadline.com/2026/02/trump-netflix-susan-rice-warner-bros-1236731945/) on Loomer’s post, adding that “Netflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences.”

While his post didn’t mention any specific consequences, it’s not a stretch to assume he’s threatening to step in and block [Netflix’s purchase of Warner Bros](https://www.theverge.com/news/839007/netflix-warner-acquisition). if he doesn’t get his way. It’s already been widely assumed that Trump would prefer Warner be purchased by [Paramount](https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/879947/warner-bros-discovery-reopen-talks-paramount-netflix-merger), which has [shown](https://www.theverge.com/news/709544/stephen-colberts-version-of-the-late-show-will-end-next-may) a [willingness](https://www.theverge.com/policy/881174/brendan-carrs-fcc-is-going-after-the-view-for-its-james-talarico-interview) to [go after](https://www.theverge.com/policy/880009/stephen-colbert-cbs-fcc-brendan-carr-talarico-interview)[critics](https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285305/trump-lawsuit-cbs-harris-interview-fcc-broadcast-censorship) of the Trump [administration](https://www.theverge.com/policy/849432/60-minutes-cecot-censored-canada-leak) and is run by the [Ellison](https://www.theverge.com/tech/787051/larry-ellison-tiktok-quest-to-run-the-world) family.
