Plaid, a company that connects financial applications to users’ bank accounts, enabling payments and data verification, has allowed employees to sell some of their shares at an $8 billion valuation, the company confirmed to TechCrunch on Thursday.

The valuation represents a 31% increase from the $6.1 billion valuation the 13-year-old company achieved in April of last year, when it raised a [$575 million](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/03/fintech-plaid-raises-575m-at-6-1b-valuation-says-it-will-not-go-public-in-2025/) round led by Franklin Templeton for partly the same purpose: purchasing shares from employees, including to help them cover the taxes associated with converting expiring restricted stock units (RSUs, a form of equity compensation) into shares.

Despite its new, bigger headline number, Plaid is still valued at 40% below its $13.4 billion peak in 2021, when ultra-low interest rates drove a massive surge in fintech valuations.

Such transactions have become increasingly common among private companies using liquidity as a [retention tool](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/secondary-sales-shift-from-founder-windfalls-to-employee-retention-tools/). Recent examples include Stripe, which this week said it would allow employees to sell shares at a [$159 billion valuation](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/24/stripes-valuation-soars-74-to-159-billion/), as well as [Clay](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/secondary-sales-shift-from-founder-windfalls-to-employee-retention-tools/), [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/announcing-an-employee-tender), and [Linear](https://linear.app/now/giving-our-team-liquidity-through-linear-s-first-tender-offer).

Beyond retention and to help staff cover tax bills triggered when RSUs vest, they relieve pressure on management to pursue an IPO before the company is ready.
