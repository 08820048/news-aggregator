Microsoft is previewing a new AI system, Copilot Tasks, that it says is designed to take care of busywork for you in the background, the [company announced on Thursday](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/2026/02/26/copilot-tasks-from-answers-to-actions/). The feature takes the load off your device using its own cloud-based computer and browser, allowing it to handle a variety of jobs ranging from scheduling appointments to generating study plans while you do something else.

As noted by Microsoft, you can describe what you need to Copilot Tasks using natural language, and assign Copilot Tasks to complete jobs on a recurring, scheduled, or one-time basis. Copilot Tasks will provide a report once its work is complete.

You can call upon Copilot Tasks to do things like organize your subscriptions and cancel the ones you don’t use, as well as turn emails, attachments, and images from your inbox into a slide deck. Some other use cases include having the AI assistant surface urgent emails and draft replies, plan a birthday party from venue to invites; and keep tabs on new apartment listings every Friday, even setting up home tours.

Copilot Tasks appears to be Microsoft’s response to the agentic AI capabilities launched in recent months, including [Claude Cowork](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/860730/anthropic-cowork-feature-ai-agents-claude-code), [ChatGPT Agent Mode](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/709158/openai-new-release-chatgpt-agent-operator-deep-research), [Perplexity Computer](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/884778/perplexity-computer-combines-ai-chatbots-and-agents-into-one-system), and the [Gemini-powered “auto-browse” feature](https://www.theverge.com/news/869731/google-gemini-ai-chrome-auto-browse) in Google Chrome.

Microsoft says that Tasks will ask for permission before performing “meaningful actions,” like making a payment or sending a message for you. For now, Copilot Tasks is only available in a research preview with a “small group” of testers. You can join a waitlist for Copilot Tasks from [Microsoft’s website](https://copilot.microsoft.com/tasks/preview).
