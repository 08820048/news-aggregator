People in the European Union are now allowed to access alternative app stores thanks to the [Digital Markets Act](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/07/europes-dma-rules-for-big-tech-explained/) (DMA), a regulation designed to [foster increased competition](https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/03/dsa-vs-dma-how-europes-twin-digital-regulations-are-hitting-big-tech/) in the app ecosystem. Like Apple’s App Store, alternative app marketplaces on allow for easy access to a wider world of apps on Apple devices, but instead of the apps going through Apple’s App Review process, the apps on these third-party marketplaces have to go through a [notarization process](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118110#notarization) to ensure they meet some “baseline platform integrity standards,” [Apple says](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118110) — like being malware-free. However, each store can review and approve apps according to its own policies. The stores are also responsible for any matters relating to support and refunds, not Apple. 

To run an alternative app marketplace, developers must accept Apple’s alternative business terms for DMA-compliant apps in the EU. This includes [paying a new Core Technology Fee of €0.50](https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/#distribution-eu) for each first annual install of their marketplace app, even before the threshold of 1 million installs is met, which is the bar for other EU apps distributed under Apple’s DMA business terms. 

Despite the complicated new rules, a handful of developers have taken advantage of the opportunity to distribute their apps outside of Apple’s walls. 

Beyond the EU, other markets are experimenting with alternative app stores, as well, like Japan. In December 2025, [Apple announced its compliance](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/12/apple-announces-changes-to-ios-in-japan/) with the Mobile Software Competition Act (MSCA), which gives developers new options to distribute apps and process payments outside of Apple’s App Store.

This option also requires developers to [accept new business terms](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/12/apple-announces-changes-to-ios-in-japan/), like a reduced 10% to 21% App Store commission, a payment processing fee for Apple in-app purchases of 5%, a core technology fee of 5%, and a 15% store services commission on web sales made through a link in the app.

Below is a list of the alternative app stores iPhone users in these markets can try today. 

## AltStore PAL (EU)

Co-created by developer Riley Testut, maker of the Nintendo game emulator app [Delta](https://deltaemulator.com/), the AltStore PAL is an officially approved alternative app marketplace in the EU. The [open source](https://github.com/altstoreio/AltStore) app store will allow independent developers to distribute their apps alongside the apps from AltStore’s makers, Delta, and a [clipboard manager, called Clip](https://rileytestut.com/blog/2020/06/17/introducing-clip/). 

Techcrunch event

Boston, MA | June 9, 2026

Unlike Apple’s App Store, AltStore apps are self-hosted by the developer. To work, developers download an alternative distribution packet (ADP) and upload it to their server, then create a “source” that users will add to the AltStore to access their apps. That means the only apps you’ll see in the AltStore are those you’ve added yourselves. 

Some [popular apps that users are adding](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/24/alternative-app-store-altstore-pal-adds-third-party-ios-apps-in-wake-of-eu-apple-ruling/) include the virtual machine app [UTM](https://getutm.app/), which lets you run Windows and other software on iOS or iPad; [OldOS](https://github.com/zzanehip/The-OldOS-Project), a re-creation of iOS 4 that’s built in SwiftUI; [Kotoba](https://github.com/willhains/Kotoba), the iOS dictionary available as a stand-alone app; torrenting app [iTorrent](https://github.com/XITRIX/iTorrent); qBittorrent remote client for iOS devices called [qBitControl](https://github.com/Michael-128/qBitControl); and social discovery platform [PeopleDrop](https://peopledrop.app/).

## Setapp Mobile (EU – closed Feb. 2026)

MacPaw’s Setapp became one of the [first companies to agree to Apple’s new DMA business terms](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/29/macpaws-setapp-becomes-one-of-the-first-to-agree-to-apples-controversial-dma-rules/) to set up an alternative app store for EU users. Unfortunately, this app store didn’t last long — the company announced it would [sunset the Setapp Mobile service](https://www.theverge.com/news/863978/setapp-mobile-ios-store-shutdown) on February 16, 2026. (Applications on Setapp Desktop weren’t affected.) The company cited Apple’s “still-evolving” and complex business terms as the reason for its decision.

The company had long offered a subscription-based service featuring a selection of curated apps for customers on iOS and Mac. Following the implementation of the DMA, it released the alternative app store for [Setapp Mobile](https://support.setapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/13693582525340-Install-Setapp-Mobile) for iOS users only in the EU. Similar to its other subscription offerings, the now-shuttered app store had included dozens of apps under a single recurring subscription price, and the number of apps grew over time. The apps were free from in-app purchases or ads and are generally considered high quality. However, it didn’t include big-name apps like Facebook, Uber, Netflix, and others. 

## Epic Games Store (EU)

Fortnite maker Epic Games [launched its alternative iOS app store](https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/16/fortnite-maker-epic-games-launches-its-app-store-on-ios-in-the-eu-worldwide-on-android/) in the EU in August 2024, allowing users to download games, including its own Fortnite and others like Rocket League Sideswipe and Fall Guys, with more to come. The company said it’s also bringing its games to other alternative app stores, including AltStore PAL, which it’s now supporting via a grant, as well as Aptoide’s iOS store in the EU and ONE Store on Android. 

The move to launch Fortnite in alternative iOS marketplaces comes more than four years after Apple removed the game from its App Store over policy violations, ahead of Epic’s legal challenge to the alleged App Store monopoly. While U.S. courts decided that Apple was not engaged in antitrust behavior, the lawsuit did [pave the way for developers](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/21/apple-antitrust-epic-games/) to link to their own websites for a reduced commission. 

## Aptoide (EU)

An alternative game store for iPhone, Lisbon-based [Aptoide](https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/03/aptoide-launches-its-alternative-ios-game-store-in-eu/) is an open source solution for app distribution. The company, already known for its Google Play alternative, says it scans the apps to ensure they are safe to download and install.

The iOS version of the Aptoide store launched as an invite-only beta in June 2024 before becoming available to all across the EU. As a free-to-use store, Aptoide doesn’t charge its users to cover its Core Technology Fee paid to Apple, but takes a 10% to 20% commission on in-app purchases on iOS, depending on whether they were generated by the marketplace or not. 

Across all platforms, including Android, web, car, and TV, Aptoide offers 1 million apps to its more than 430 million users. 

## Mobivention marketplace (EU)

A B2B-focused app store, the [Mobivention](https://app-marketplace.eu/?lang=en) marketplace allows EU companies to distribute their internal apps that are used by employees, but can’t — or shouldn’t — be published in Apple’s App Store. The company also offers the development of a customized app marketplace for companies that want to offer employees their own app store just for their corporate apps. Larger companies can even license Mobivention’s technology to more deeply customize the app marketplace to their own needs.

## Skich (EU)

Last March, [Skich](https://skich.app/) [announced](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/skich-challenges-epic-games-with-an-alternative-app-store-on-ios-in-the-eu/) the launch of an alternative app store for EU users, which differentiates itself by offering a Tinder-like interface for app discovery. That is, users swipe right to “match” with apps they might enjoy. They can also create playlists and see what apps their friends are playing. The new store will replace Skich’s existing app and will see the company taking a 15% commission on all purchases. Instead of filling its app store with apps right away, the store marketed to developers at the Game Developers Conference ([GDC](https://gdconf.com/)).

## Onside (EU and Japan)

![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/onside-app-store.jpg?w=680)

Onside

[Onside](https://onside.io/) is an alternative iOS app store available in both the EU and, now, Japan, as of February 17, 2026, thanks to the new regulations. The company promises it will charge developers lower rates while still offering security, including keeping payment information private. The store currently supports bank card payments and Apple Pay and will later roll out support for other payment methods like iDeal, Klarna, and more.

For consumers, Onside touts a range of top apps and exclusives that can’t be found on other marketplaces within a familiar interface that includes traditional app store features, like editorial collections, ratings and reviews, and automatic updates.
