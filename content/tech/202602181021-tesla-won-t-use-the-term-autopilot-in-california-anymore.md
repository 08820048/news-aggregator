Tesla is no longer using the term “Autopilot” to describe the self-driving capabilities of its vehicles in California, avoiding a 30-day sales suspension in the state. The [California Department of Motor Vehicles](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/news-and-media/tesla-takes-corrective-action-to-avoid-dmv-suspension/) (DMV) announced that Tesla has taken corrective action after finding in December that the EV manufacturer’s marketing was violating state law and misleading customers into thinking its cars would drive autonomously.

The [DMV’s complaint](https://www.theverge.com/news/846152/tesla-autopilot-marketing-deceptive-california-dmv) is connected to written marketing materials for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) features that Tesla started publishing in May 2021, which later led to the EV maker appending “(Supervised)” to its use of “Full Self-Driving Capability.” In December, the agency gave Tesla a 60-day window to also stop using the term Autopilot or face a 30-day manufacturing license and dealer license suspension — temporarily blocking Tesla from selling vehicles to its largest US market.

“The DMV is committed to safety throughout all California’s roadways and communities,” said DMV Director Steve Gordon. “The department is pleased that Tesla took the required action to remain in compliance with the State of California’s consumer protections.”
