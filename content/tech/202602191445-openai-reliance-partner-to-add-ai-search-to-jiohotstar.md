OpenAI is partnering with Reliance to add AI-powered conversational search to the Indian conglomerate’s streaming service JioHotstar.

The feature, which is powered by OpenAI’s API, will let users search for movies, shows and live sports using text and voice prompts in multiple languages, and receive recommendations based on their preferences and history.

OpenAI has recently expanded its footprint in India, which is home to [more than 100 million weekly ChatGPT users](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/india-has-100m-weekly-active-chatgpt-users-sam-altman-says/). The company plans to open offices in Mumbai and Bengaluru later this year, adding to its current office in New Delhi.

The partnership was announced at the ongoing [India AI Impact Summit](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/16/all-the-important-news-from-the-ongoing-india-ai-summit/) in New Delhi, where [Altman is appearing](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/openai-chief-sam-altman-plans-india-visit-as-ai-leaders-converge-in-new-delhi-sources/) alongside industry leaders, including Anthropic’s Dario Amodei and Google’s Sundar Pichai.

The companies also plan to extend the partnership to surface JioHotstar recommendations directly within ChatGPT, allowing users who search for entertainment through ChatGPT to receive contextual suggestions and deep links into the platform’s catalogue. The move positions the integration as a two-way discovery layer rather than a standalone in-app feature.

The move comes as streaming and TV platforms increasingly experiment with conversational interfaces. [Netflix](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/netflix-debuts-its-generative-ai-powered-search-tool/) said in May 2025 it was testing a new search experience using OpenAI’s ChatGPT to help viewers find content through natural language, while Google in November introduced [Gemini-powered discovery features for its Google TV](https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/10/google-brings-gemini-to-the-google-tv-streamer/) platform.

Fidji Simo, chief executive of applications at OpenAI, said the partnership is aimed at bringing more personalized AI experiences into entertainment and live sports, enabling viewers to move “from curiosity to context” through natural interactions.

Embedding AI into content discovery will help reshape how audiences find and engage with programming, said Uday Shankar, vice chairperson of JioStar.

The rollout will span both live and on-demand formats, the companies said.

The JioHotstar partnership is part of OpenAI’s broader “OpenAI for India” push to deepen its presence in the South Asian nation through infrastructure, enterprise, and [education partnerships](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/18/openai-pushes-into-higher-education-as-india-seeks-to-scale-ai-skills/). Other moves under the initiative include [collaborations with the Tata Group](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/18/openai-taps-tata-for-100mw-ai-data-center-capacity-in-india-eyes-1gw/) on AI-ready data centers and enterprise deployments, as well as [agreements with Indian companies such as Pine Labs](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/18/openai-deepens-india-push-with-pine-labs-fintech-partnership/), Eternal, and MakeMyTrip.
