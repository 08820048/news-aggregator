“At Volvo Cars, we believe that good design, quality, and sustainability are inherently connected. Recycled and renewable materials aren’t just an option for us, they’re essential to shape a better future,” said Rekha Meena, head of colors, materials, and finishes at Volvo Cars. “Our responsibility is to blend these elements seamlessly, creating a sense of luxury and timelessness, all while ensuring that our products stand the test of time.”

Like Widrick at Cadillac, Meena wants Volvo interiors to have a sense of harmony, and that’s on good display with the EX90. “When it comes to textiles, we see the versatility and strong potential to deliver all these qualities combining warmth, tactility, and refined expression in a way that enhances both the driving experience and the emotional connection to the interior,” Meena said.

Textiles have a long tradition in Scandinavian design, where “luxury is about simplicity, honesty, and attention to detail,” Meena told Ars. “When developed with care, textile upholstery can feel refined, modern, and long-lasting. Textiles allow us to create softness and depth in ways other materials cannot, resulting in interiors that feel calm, thoughtful, and welcoming.”

As for when to break away from leather, that’s up to the experience the design team wants to create for drivers. “We do not view textiles as replacements for leather or vinyl,” Meena said. “Each material has its own strengths, and customer choice remains paramount. What textiles offer, however, is something distinct: greater variation, a richer sensory experience, and a more human, approachable character.”

That sense of harmony is achieved with the tailored wool blend option for [Volvo’s EX90](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/09/ex90review/), and all four of the trim options for the affordable [EX30](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/11/driving-the-volvo-ex30-a-36k-ev-that-prioritizes-sustainability/) feature some degree of textile trim on the seats and door panels. Indeed, Volvo’s distinctive and somewhat left-field style is now as much part of the brand as its stated commitment to road safety.

That’s all to say that I think it’s time for more luxury brands to get bold with their materials. A sofa or lounge chair doesn’t need animal hide to be considered stylish or luxurious, and neither does a car interior. It just needs good design.
