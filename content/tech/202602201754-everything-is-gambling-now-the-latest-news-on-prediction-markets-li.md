summary: "Prediction markets will let you bet on just about anything, from how many tweets Elon Musk will post this week to the next president of the United States, with predictions sometimes showing shockingly (or suspiciously) spot-on accuracy. Polymarket’s CEO Shayne Copland has even claimed that prediction markets are “the most accurate thing we have as mankind right now.” However, these platforms blur the lines — in terms of both function and regulation — between gambling and stock trading. As Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal said on The Vergecast, “All of the lines between trading, speculating, [and] gambling are just being completely torn apart.” There are also ethical concerns surfacing around prediction markets, like whether it’s acceptable to be able to place a bet on virtually everything, along with concerns about insider trading. For instance, a newly-created Polymarket account made over $400,000 in January betting on the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. Prop bet Substack isn’t just known for “platforming and monetizing Nazis” now. It’s MAGA v Broligarch in the battle over prediction markets Nevada sues to block Kalshi’s prediction betting market Polymarket ran a popup ‘free grocery store’ in NYC because it has ‘market’ in its name.

    This is just the latest foray of prediction markets into media. Last week, [Dow Jones agreed to incorporate Polymarket’s betting data](https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/polymarket-dow-jones-partner-to-display-prediction-markets-data-in-dow-jones-content-453605ed) into its “content,” including _The Wall Street Journal_. A month before that, [CNN incorporated Kalshi’s betting odds](https://news.kalshi.com/p/kalshi-cnn-prediction-market-partnership). In December, CNBC [agreed to infuse its programming with Kalshi data](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/04/cnbc-and-kalshi-strike-exclusive-partnership.html).

    Nevada is [suing to block the prediction market](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/27174906-nevada-v-kalshi/) platform Kalshi from allowing residents to place bets on the outcomes of events, including elections and sports games, as [reported earlier by _Business Insider_](https://www.businessinsider.com/nevada-sues-kalshi-trump-cftc-with-prediction-markets-2026-2). The lawsuit adds to a growing number of legal battles across the country, claiming that Kalshi is harming the state’s gambling market by operating without a proper license and by allowing users under 21 to use the platform.
    
    The state of Nevada filed the lawsuit just hours after [a federal appeals court denied Kalshi’s request](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/kalshi-loses-bid-to-stop-nevada-from-proceeding-with-case-against-the-platform-158663f7?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqdZ2vB__JW_pg5zjBHGJfRJxBRBXdtkSddPqLQAt-f501iyaxBHbjAzZeuEb54%3D&gaa_ts=6995cf61&gaa_sig=eUBbN8WBnHW8lXqL2PErDXgE4-VTrvitoiCXP4SYEp9-HYe41cwum7qSj2Ovu734WtkfyEh8Kq2ty_vn-U7_hg%3D%3D) to block Nevada from taking action against the company. As prediction betting platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket become more popular — allowing users to place bets on everything [from election outcomes](https://www.theverge.com/column/815208/election-night-at-kalshi-hq) to the [capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro](https://www.theverge.com/news/853765/someone-made-a-ton-of-money-betting-on-maduros-capture) — state lawmakers have had to grapple with how to regulate them. But putting local restrictions on prediction betting markets may prove difficult, as the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is rallying against state-level regulations.

    Polymarket ran a popup ‘free grocery store’ in NYC because it has ‘market’ in its name.
    
    _[Curbed](https://www.curbed.com/article/polymarket-free-grocery-pop-up-west-village-opening-day.html)_ described the scene as “bleak” and noted that many waiting in line for [the promised](https://www.theverge.com/news/873460/polymarket-and-kalshi-play-nino-brown) free Tide Pods and milk (which was apparently purchased at an Aldi before being stocked on the popups’ oddly orderly shelves) had never heard of Polymarket and didn’t intend to place bets there. When _[Curbed](https://www.curbed.com/article/polymarket-free-grocery-pop-up-west-village-opening-day.html)_ asked why:
    
    > Because of the word market within Polymarket, per Josh Tucker, a company executive. Get it? Daf Orlovsky, a creative director, said it could work — “these ideas that don’t seem possible could be brought to life at tech-market speed,” he said.

[Kalshi advertised](https://x.com/Kalshi/status/2018393155373072538) a $50 giveaway today, and Polymarket [announced](https://x.com/Polymarket/status/2018731372920344582) what it says will be “New York’s first free grocery store” when it opens on February 12th.

    Political betting is illegal in Portugal, and its gambling regulator says Polymarket doesn’t have a license to operate in the country, _CoinDesk_ reports.

    On December 31st, a [brand-new account on Polymarket](https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/maduro-polymarket-bet-a2e5d100?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqdSE7inMukTf-1CLiOZ7ZTj3LKv-ZOUbVxHNvkOhopaInhcYwqzkNU9UAeFD0U%3D&gaa_ts=695ed05e&gaa_sig=Ht3t8_c7hl6xPoVI8cu_TdettmTa22belJSnfCO8k0pJCWrQQ_7eGn5IQtQabEHj0HfyxyLGq0TTyq7bas-3AA%3D%3D) placed a bet: Nicolás Maduro, the leader of Venezuela, would be out of office by the end of January. It was the first in a series of increasing bets. On January 3rd, the US bombed the Venezuelan capital, kidnapped Maduro and his wife, and killed at least 80 people along the way. The account cashed out with almost half a million dollars.
    
    It would be a misread to describe the surprise invasion of Venezuela as imperial expansion driven by the dictates of capitalism; it is, somehow, worse. Normal capitalism requires a working relationship with reality. Normal capitalism thrives on predictability. The Trump administration is behaving like gambling addicts chasing clout in an attention economy. Venezuela is a fucking meme stock.

    Shortly before the US military launched an attack on Venezuela and [captured President Nicolás Maduro](https://www.theverge.com/news/853728/the-u-s-attacked-venezuela-and-arrested-president-nicolas-maduro), an account on Polymarket made some _very_ suspiciously timed investments. The [prediction market](https://www.theverge.com/podcast/845198/prediction-markets-mcp-vergecast) had been running bets on when or if Maduro would be removed from power, with prices for “out by January 31, 2026” [as low as $0.07](https://x.com/joostienXD/status/2007366398587351500) late Friday evening. But within 24 hours of the military action, a newly created account invested tens of thousands of dollars, racking up several hundred thousand in profits.
    
    [The account](https://polymarket.com/@0x31a56e9E690c621eD21De08Cb559e9524Cdb8eD9-1766730765984) was created less than a week ago and invested over $30,000 the day before the assault, turning a profit of over [$408,000](https://x.com/JoePompliano/status/2007455311351718118). The activity was [flagged](https://x.com/tysonbrody/status/2007345590968160516) on [social media](https://bsky.app/profile/bluser12.bsky.social/post/3mbiwc7s2yk2k), with people speculating that the person placing the bet was acting on inside information and perhaps even worked at the Pentagon. Joe Pompliano, an investor and podcaster, quickly [pointed out](https://x.com/JoePompliano/status/2007455311351718118) on X that “Insider trading is not only allowed on prediction markets; it’s encouraged.”

    On [this episode of _The Vergecast_](https://pod.link/vergecast), we try to figure out where prediction markets came from, and why they’ve become so popular. _Bloomberg_’s [Joe Weisenthal](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AQ0VXvE12t0/joe-weisenthal) joins the show to track the rise of Polymarket and Kalshi, explain their controversies and ultimate acceptance, and put these companies in their correct place in the economy. Most of all, he helps us figure out if there’s actually something new happening here, or if the betting has been happening forever.

    If you’ve been on social media lately, you might’ve seen the [unsettling AI slop videos](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1krwsaw/made_a_comprehensive_compilation_of_all_the/) showing AI-generated people in wild scenarios or just speaking a bunch of nonsense. On Wednesday night, the betting platform Kalshi decided to take this trend outside the social sphere by putting [a nonsensical AI-generated ad](https://x.com/Kalshi/status/1932891608388681791) in front of the millions of viewers watching the NBA Finals — and it apparently cost just $2,000 to make.
    
    The AI-generated highlights various things “people” are betting on, like whether the Oklahoma City Thunder or Indiana Pacers will win the NBA Finals, how many hurricanes will occur this year, and whether the price of eggs will go up this month. It flashes between scenes of an elderly man wearing a cowboy hat while carrying a chihuahua, someone swimming in a pool of eggs, and an alien chugging beer.

    Today, I’m talking with Vlad Tenev, the cofounder and CEO of Robinhood, which is one of the most well-known consumer finance apps in the world. It started as a way to open up stock trading, but the company’s ambitions have grown over time — and they’re getting even bigger.
    
    Just a day before Tenev and I talked, Robinhood [announced](https://www.theverge.com/news/636733/robinhood-banking-launch-cash-deliveries) it would soon be offering bank accounts and wealth management services, which would allow Robinhood to be involved with your money at every possible level.

    Polymarket quietly raised more money before the FBI raided the CEO’s apartment.
    
    > Coplan recently raised, but has yet to announce, a $30 million round of funding at a $350 million valuation. And in recent conversations with investors (a surprising number of whom passed on the round, which was less than Coplan hoped to raise), I’m told he was noncommittal about whether the company would work to get the Commodity Futures Trading Commission license it needs to operate in the US.

    The FBI reportedly seized the phone of Polymarket’s CEO.
    
    > It wasn’t immediately clear what prompted the FBI’s search of \[Shayne\] Coplan, the 26-year-old entrepreneur behind one of the most successful prediction markets in history. But Polymarket quickly tied the raid to its track record in the recent presidential election, in which bettors on its platform correctly anticipated that Donald Trump would beat Vice President Kamala Harris.
    
    [_Bloomberg_ also reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/polymarket-investigated-by-doj-for-letting-us-users-bet-on-platform) that Polymarket is being investigated by the DOJ for allegedly letting users in the US place bets on the site.

    This week’s presidential election introduced a lot of people to prediction markets.
    
    Kalshi was the [number one app](https://x.com/Kalshi/status/1854615718270263788) in the App Store on Election Day. The CEO of Polymarket [claims](https://x.com/shayne_coplan/status/1854045045806023002) the Trump campaign first realized they were winning from his startup’s stats, which showed them winning by a landslide hours before news networks called the race. There’s a sense in some tech and finance circles that these betting markets are now a better “wisdom of the crowd” indicator than polls.

    Presidential betting platform Kalshi loads up on debt.
    
    The startup has received “tens of millions from investors in short-term loans“ to make sure it can cover election bets:
    
    > Like most brokerages, the company offers instant funding to new users. This means users can start trading right away, even though it may take two to three business days for the funds to be officially transferred from the customer’s bank account to Kalshi’s.

    US citizens can [gamble on the upcoming election](https://newsroom.aboutrobinhood.com/introducing-the-presidential-election-market/) on Robinhood, the [financial nihilism app](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22574133/robinhood-meme-trades-dogecoin-ipo) announced. Robinhood has termed this “unlocking a new asset class that democratizes access to events as they unfold.”
    
    Let’s pause — I would like to reflect on this incredible phrase, about an _asset class that democratizes access to events as they unfold._ See, I thought we all had access to the events of the election because we all exist in reality and can find out about them. But apparently, if we can’t gamble on an event, it isn’t happening. This is a fascinating vision of metaphysics, and I would like to hear more about it. No one bet on my birth, for instance, and thus there is no asset class relating to my existence. So am I real?
