With HBO’s critically acclaimed [_A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms_](https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/12/knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-trailer-brings-levity-to-westeros/) gearing up for its season finale on Sunday, it’s time to check in on that other _Game of Thrones_ spinoff: the far darker [_House of the Dragon_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_the_Dragon), which now has a suitably ominous teaser for its upcoming third season.

**(Spoilers for the first two seasons below.)**

[The series is set](https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/12/tensions-rise-between-targaryens-in-first-teaser-for-house-of-the-dragon-s2/) nearly 200 years before the events of _Game of Thrones,_ when dragons were still a fixture of Westeros, and chronicles the beginning of the end of House Targaryen’s reign. The primary source material is [_Fire and Blood_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_%26_Blood_\(novel\)), a fictional history of the Targaryen kings written by George R.R. Martin. As book readers know, those events culminated in a civil war and the extinction of the dragons—at least until Daenerys Targaryen came along.

The first season spanned many years and featured some pretty significant time jumps, which required replacing the younger actors as their characters aged. For those who might need a refresher: King Viserys (Paddy Considine) died, and his second wife, Alicent (Olivia Cooke), conspired with her father, Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans), to crown her eldest son, Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney), as king instead of Viserys’ declared heir apparent, Rhaenyra (Emma D’Arcy).

Even though she was technically the rightful heir, Rhaenyra actually seemed to be considering House Hightower’s conditions for concession—until the arrogant Prince Aemond (Ewan Mitchell), Alicent’s younger son, went after Rhaenyra’s young son, Lucerys (Elliot Grihault). Both dragonriders failed to control their dragons, and Aemon’s much bigger dragon, Vhagar, gobbled up poor Lucerys and his little dragon, Arrax, in mid-air. The season closed with Rhaenyra and her husband/uncle Daemon (Matt Smith) receiving the devastating news, effectively dashing any hope of a peaceful resolution.

_House of the Dragon_ has always taken a leisurely, more focused approach to its characters’ political maneuverings, interspersed with bursts of bloody violence, and S2 was no exception. But it opened with a bang: the infamous “Blood and Cheese” incident (well-known to book readers), in which assassins sent to take out Aemond as vengeance for Lucerys can’t find him and butcher Aegon’s eldest son instead. We lost a couple more dragons and several supporting characters in the ensuing chaos, and Aegon was so severely wounded that Aemond became regent—with no plan to relinquish the Iron Throne any time soon.
