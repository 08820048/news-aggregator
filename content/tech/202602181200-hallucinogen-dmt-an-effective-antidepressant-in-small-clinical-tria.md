One week after the initial dose, only 6 percent of the control group (meaning two individuals) reported improvements in their depression symptoms. In contrast, nearly half (44 percent) of those who received DMT reported feeling better. While the effect began to fade by the 14-week time point, this population was still far better off than when things started.

The control group participants, who only got one dose and got it two weeks into the study, showed an interesting trajectory. Their symptoms improved slightly over the first two weeks through some combination of a placebo effect and the counseling that everyone received. But then they got substantially better after the DMT dose, ending up somewhat better by the end of the study.

There were no serious side effects following treatment, and the less-than-serious ones tended to be short-lived, like a bit of pain at the injection site. There was also a very brief spike in heart rate and blood pressure.

## Promising start

One of the big questions about psychedelics has been whether their hallucinogenic effects and their antidepressant effects are separable. There are definitely indications that the two act through different mechanisms. But this study suggests that may not be the case with DMT. “Antidepressant effects two weeks after participants’ first active DMT dose were observed to be moderated by their ‘Mystical Experience’ Questionnaire (MEQ) scores, as well as Ego Dissolution Inventory,” the authors note.

None of this is to say that DMT will be the right solution for everyone—we’ll have to wait for a larger trial and longer follow-up to get a sense of its effectiveness. And it’s important to note that this study administered it as part of a general care plan. Still, it’s promising as a drug, since even its apparently brief period of mind alteration seems to have a significant impact on clinical depression, while also greatly simplifying care for those receiving the drug.

Given that many people don’t respond to traditional antidepressants, anything that provides an additional option would be welcome.
