summary: "Spring doesn’t officially kick off until March 20th, but there’s something to be said about getting a head start on your spring cleaning. Lucky for you, Eufy’s X10 Pro Omni is currently on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and directly from Eufy (with promo code WS7DV2D5LF9F) for $449.99 ($450 off), matching its lowest price to date. Eufy X10 Pro Omni Where to Buy: $899.99 $449.99 at Amazon $899.99 $449.99 at Eufy (with code WS7DV2D5LF9F) $899.99 $449.99 at Walmart Although it’s since been dethroned as our favorite midrange robot vacuum / mop hybrid, X10 Pro Omni remains a solid choice thanks to its excellent AI-powered obstacle detection, powerful oscillating mops, and user-friendly app. The dual-spinning brushes are capable of removing dried stains with 1kg of downward pressure, and a built-in water reservoir prevents the robovac from having to frequently return to the dock just to refill its tank. Unlike a lot of bots in this price range, it also benefits from heated drying function — though not heated mop washing — thus preventing the base from smelling after repeated use. On the vacuuming front, the X10 Omni features a single rubber / bristle roller brush and 8,000Pa of suction, resulting in good performance on both carpet and tile surfaces. It offers great AI-powered object recognition, too, allowing it to deftly avoid pet messes, cables, toys, and other objects that might impede performance. Then there’s the Eufy Clean app — which lets you set schedules, establish no-go zones, and create virtual boundaries — culminating in a still-solid midrange vac. The fact that it can automatically empty its dust bin and refill its own water tank via the included multifunction dock just adds to the appeal. Other deals and discounts Nothing Phone 3, the company’s “first true flagship phone,” is on sale at Amazon and Nothing’s online storefront with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage starting at $638.99 ($160 off), its best price to date. The newer flagship is really an exercise in form over function, as it’s equipped with a weaker chipset than rival models and a less capable camera array. Still, its circular dot-matrix display is wholly unique, especially if you’re willing to spend time tinkering with the various display pictures and icons. Read our review. Earlier this week, accessory maker Nomad introduced a “cosmic orange” version of its braided, USB-C ChargeKey. If you prefer the original black version, though, Nomad is currently selling a like-new, open-box version for an all-time low of $20 ($9 off). The nifty, keychain-friendly doohickey packs 240W of power and 10Gbps data transfer speeds, which is great if you want to quickly top off your iPhone or use it with an SSD for external video recording. If you or someone you know is an aspiring birder — or, heaven forbid, a twitcher — the Birdbuddy Pro Solar is available at Target and Chewy for around $179 ($120 off), which is the lowest price we’ve seen. The solar-powered version is pretty similar to the standard model in that it can capture 2K video / 5-megapixel stills, offers several viewing angles (115 or 122 degrees), and provides plenty of detail regarding visiting birds; however, unlike the base model, the solar version doesn’t need to be charged every two or three weeks just to keep an eye on your feathery friends."
