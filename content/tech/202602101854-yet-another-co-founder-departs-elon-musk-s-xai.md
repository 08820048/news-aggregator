Other recent high-profile xAI departures include general counsel Robert Keele, communications executives Dave Heinzinger and John Stoll, head of product engineering Haofei Wang, and CFO Mike Liberatore, who left for a role at OpenAI after just 102 days of what he called “120+ hour weeks.”

## A different company

Wu leaves a company that is in a very different place than it was when he helped create it in 2023. His departure comes just days after CEO Elon Musk [merged xAI with SpaceX](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/spacex-acquires-xai-plans-1-million-satellite-constellation-to-power-it/), a move Musk says will allow for orbiting data centers and, eventually, “scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!” But some see the move as [more of a financial engineering play](https://www.irishtimes.com/your-money/2026/02/08/spacex-ipo-faces-new-questions-after-musks-ai-merger/), combining xAI’s nearly $1 billion a year in losses and SpaceX’s roughly $8 billion in annual profits into a single, [more IPO-ready entity](https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/12/after-years-of-resisting-it-spacex-now-plans-to-go-public-why/).

Musk previously rolled social media network X (formerly Twitter) into a unified entity with xAI [back in March](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/elon-musks-x-has-a-new-owner-elon-musks-xai/). At the time of the deal, X was valued at $33 billion, 25 percent less than Musk paid for the social network in 2022.

xAI has faced a fresh wave of criticism in recent months over [Grok’s willingness to generate sexualized images of minors](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/x-blames-users-for-grok-generated-csam-no-fixes-announced/). That has led to [an investigation by California’s attorney general](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/musk-still-defending-groks-partial-nudes-as-california-ag-opens-probe/) and [a police raid of the company’s Paris offices](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/x-office-raided-in-frances-grok-probe-elon-musk-summoned-for-questioning/).
