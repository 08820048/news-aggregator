Social network Bluesky is finally rolling out one of users’ most-requested features: drafts. Bluesky’s competitors, X and Threads, have long supported the ability to write drafts, which is seen as a baseline feature for services like this. Users can access drafts on Bluesky the same way they do on these other platforms, which is by opening the new post flow and selecting the Drafts button in the top-right corner. The rollout of drafts comes as Bluesky recently teased its roadmap for the year ahead. The company said it plans to focus on improving the app’s algorithmic Discover feed, offering better recommendations on who to follow, and making the app feel more real-time, among other updates. At the same time, the company acknowledged that it still needs to get the basics right. Although Bluesky has gained a loyal user base, it still lags behind rivals when it comes to basic features, like private accounts and support for longer videos. Launched to the public in early 2024, Bluesky has since scaled to over 42 million users, according to data sourced directly from the Bluesky API for developers.
