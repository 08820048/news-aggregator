Instagram is [expanding](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/instagram-brings-reels-to-the-big-screen-starting-with-amazon-fire-tv/) its [Instagram for TV app](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/instagram-brings-reels-to-the-big-screen-starting-with-amazon-fire-tv/) to Google TV devices in the U.S., two months after its debut on Amazon Fire TV in December. The app first launched as a way to expand Reels-viewing beyond mobile, and now users can also browse posts from their Instagram feeds directly on their TVs.

By bringing reels to TVs, Instagram is looking to better compete with YouTube, which [largely dominates the TV space](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/27/youtube-tops-disney-and-netflix-in-tv-viewing-nielsen-finds/). Instagram likely wants viewers to switch to its TV app while watching content on the couch, similar to flipping through TV channels. Rival TikTok [also has a TV app](https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/tiktok-brings-its-tv-app-to-more-devices-across-the-u-s-and-canada/).

The new app is personalized to each user, as it shows reels based on the content and creators they enjoy on the Instagram app. Reels are organized into channels and categories based on topics such as comedy, music, and lifestyle.

Reels play automatically, which means you won’t have to keep scrolling to watch the next video. The Instagram for TV app lets you like, view comments, and re-share reels.

Users can pair the app with their Instagram app and add up to five accounts in one home. Or, they can choose to create a new account just for TV viewing.
