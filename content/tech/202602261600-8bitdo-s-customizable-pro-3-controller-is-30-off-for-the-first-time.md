summary: "Woot is offering steep discounts on many video games and accessories, some of which are fairly recent releases. No matter what you choose from its sale catalog, you can get up to $30 off your order with the code LEVEL20 used at checkout through the end of the day on February 27th (the sale lasts through March 5th, but the coupon ends beforehand). 8BitDo’s highly customizable Pro 3 controller for Switch 2, PC and mobile devices is getting its biggest discount at Woot, selling for $39.99 (originally $69.99) with the code applied, or $49.99 without the code. 8BitDo Pro 3 Wireless Controller The Pro 3 features swappable ABXY face buttons and joystick caps, providing players with a highly customizable experience. It also features new L4 and R4 macro buttons between the triggers and its USB-C charging port, along with more durable and power efficient TMR joysticks. Where to Buy: $69.99 $39.99 at Woot (with code LEVEL20) The Pro 3 is a great, comfortable controller, and its swappable, magnetic face buttons are one of its top features. You can adjust the button layout from Switch to Xbox, or swap them for them for unlabeled button faces that are included with each controller. In terms of hardware features, the Pro 3 is similar to the Ultimate 2, packing TMR joysticks, triggers with adjustable stops, and extra macro buttons. One of the key differences, however, is that it has a PlayStation-style stick layout. It can wake the Switch 2, but its rumble performance is behind some of our favorite Switch 2 controllers. Read our review. Other Verge-approved deals Samsung debuted its new Galaxy S26 phones this week along with some new wireless earbuds, the Galaxy Buds 4 lineup. There’s a great preorder deal on the S26 phone, and you can also get a freebie with either of its Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro. Amazon is offering a free gift card with both sets. The $179.99 Buds 4 include a $20 gift card — not bad — and the $249.99 Buds 4 Pro that offer improved sound and battery life include a $30 gift card with purchase. AirTags are a great, compact Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users, but their Mentos-like shape may not be what you’re after. Ugreen’s FineTrack card-shaped tracker should fit easily into your wallet, and it’s down to $17.99 at Amazon (originally $29.99). It connects to Apple’s Find My network, just like AirTags and some other third-party trackers. It offers IP68 protection, and is rechargeable (via a proprietary cable included), offering up to one year of battery life per charge. I’m on a streak of including QD-OLED gaming monitors in our roundups, and I’m keeping it going with a refurbished deal on MSI’s 27-inch 1440p model that has a 240Hz refresh rate. You can snag one at eBay through a seller that has great ratings for $369.99 (typically priced at $429.99 or so in new condition). I got my hands on this 271QPX E2 model to test ahead of Black Friday when it sold at Costco for $379.99 — a price that hasn’t returned since. It offers multiple video inputs, including DisplayPort, HDMI, as well as USB-C. This purchase includes a two-year warranty covered by Allstate."
