More than a week after Nancy Guthrie disappeared, the FBI has released footage from a Nest camera by Guthrie’s front door. FBI Director Kash Patel [says on X](https://x.com/FBIDirectorKash/status/2021281103454072983?s=20) that law enforcement has been working with “private sector partners” and that the video was “recovered from residual data located in backend systems.” Google spokesperson Patrick Seybold tells _The Verge_ that the company is “assisting law enforcement with their investigations.”

The FBI [has released](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/kidnap/nancy-guthrie) two videos and a few still images. In the [first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbAI30dhSMw), a masked individual with a backpack walks up to the camera and holds a glove in front of it while appearing to touch something below the camera lens, and then walks away to pick up something from the yard. The [second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoQf99nFdzM) shows the individual holding up a bundle of leaves in front of the camera, seemingly to try to cover the lens.

A potential abductor or abductors sent apparent ransom letters to media outlets last week demanding millions of dollars in Bitcoin, [as reported by _People_](https://people.com/nancy-guthrie-ransom-note-multi-million-dollar-demands-deadline-11900782)_._ On Monday evening, the Pima County Sheriff’s Department [said that](https://x.com/PimaSheriff/status/2021009531174891608) “investigators have not identified any suspects, persons of interest, or vehicles connected to Nancy Guthrie.”

The FBI is offering a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to the recovery of Guthrie “and/or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance.” Guthrie was last seen at her house in the evening of January 31st, and the FBI says she is “considered to be a vulnerable adult who has difficulty walking, has a pacemaker, and needs daily medication for a heart condition.”
