AI companies have been hemorrhaging talent the past few weeks. Half of xAI’s founding team has left the company — some on their own, others through “restructuring” — while OpenAI is facing its own shakeups, from the [disbanding of its mission alignment team](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/openai-disbands-mission-alignment-team-which-focused-on-safe-and-trustworthy-ai-development/) to the firing of a policy exec who opposed its “adult mode” feature. 

Watch as TechCrunch’s [Equity](https://techcrunch.com/podcasts/equity/) podcast hosts Kirsten Korosec, Anthony Ha, and Sean O’Kane dig into the week’s biggest deals and departures, from billion-dollar bets on fusion and robotics to the tech exodus reshaping AI companies.
