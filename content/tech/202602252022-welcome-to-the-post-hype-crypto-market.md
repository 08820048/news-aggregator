Crypto is creeping back into the startup conversation, but at [ETHDenver](https://ethdenver.com/) last week, the buzz was as much about Washington as it was about tokens. Policy shifts are rippling through the market as [Tether](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/01/why-tethers-ceo-is-everywhere-right-now/) and stablecoins face scrutiny, [players like Stripe](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/01/why-tethers-ceo-is-everywhere-right-now/) re-enter the conversation, and startups either find traction or flame out. The hype cycle is over, or at least taking a break. So what comes next? 

On this episode of TechCrunch’s [Equity](https://techcrunch.com/podcasts/equity/) podcast, Rebecca Bellan sits down with Jacquelyn Melinek, CEO of Token Relations and host of the Talking Tokens and Crypto in America podcasts, to make sense of how the market has changed and what in the world of crypto is built to last.
