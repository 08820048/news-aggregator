Spotify and Liquid Death have teamed up to launch what might be the wildest product collaboration of the year: [the Eternal Playlist Urn](https://liquiddeath.com/pages/spotify-urn), a wireless Bluetooth speaker shaped like a cremation urn. Yes, you read that right.

The Eternal Playlist Urn is not really meant to hold ashes, but is instead a collector’s item, with only 150 available for purchase in the U.S. For $495, buyers receive a 7-inch-by-11.4-inch urn with a Bluetooth speaker built into the lid. (We question the audio quality, since all the tech is crammed into the lid of this tiny urn.)

According to Spotify, the urn offers “the world’s first ever music-streaming urn,” making death “a lot less boring.” With this product, the idea is that even the dearly departed can keep jamming to their favorite tunes for eternity, or at least that’s the company’s joke.

“Life needs music. So does the afterlife. That’s why Spotify has partnered with Liquid Death to create the Eternal Playlist Urn, the world’s first wireless speaker designed to bring your music somewhere it’s never been before,” Spotify [stated](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2026-02-24/liquid-death-eternal-playlist-urn/) in a blog post. 

When you get the urn, you can create your own [Eternal Playlist](http://open.spotify.com/presents/eternalplaylist) on Spotify by answering questions like “What’s your eternal vibe?” or “What’s your go-to ghost noise?” Spotify will then use your answers and listening history to generate a custom playlist, which syncs directly to the urn’s speaker and can be shared with friends and family.

While Spotify hasn’t released a branded smart speaker, it partnered with [Ikea](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/newsroom/corporate-news/ikea-introduces-first-bluetooth-speaker-with-spotify-tap-to-bring-light-and-music-outdoors-pub9ead9890/) in 2022 on a portable Bluetooth lamp speaker with Spotify Tap functionality, making this the company’s second hardware collaboration with another brand. The company also released “[Car Thing](https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/22/spotifys-in-car-entertainment-device-car-thing-is-now-publicly-available/),” an in-car entertainment device, which was later [discontinued.](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/09/spotify-car-thing-units-are-officially-disabled/)

This isn’t the first time Liquid Death has pushed the limits of extreme marketing. The brand is known for its outrageous campaigns, including a [life-sized Yeti Casket-shaped cooler](https://liquiddeath.com/products/yeti-x-liquid-death-casket-cooler). While some may find the humor a little morbid, fans of dark, irreverent comedy seem to be intrigued by it. The cooler had over 800 bidders and sold for $68,200.
