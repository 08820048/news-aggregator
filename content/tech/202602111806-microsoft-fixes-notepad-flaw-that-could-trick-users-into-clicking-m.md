Microsoft has fixed a serious security vulnerability affecting Markdown files in Notepad. In the [company’s Tuesday patch notes](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2026-20841), Microsoft says a bad actor could carry out a remote code execution attack by tricking users “into clicking a malicious link inside a Markdown file opened in Notepad,” as [reported earlier by _The Register_](https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/11/notepad_rce_flaw/).

Clicking the link would “launch unverified protocols,” allowing attackers to remotely load and execute malicious files on a victim’s computer, according to the patch notes. Microsoft says there isn’t any evidence of attackers exploiting the Notepad vulnerability ([CVE-2026-20841](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-20841)) in the wild, but it issued a fix for the flaw in its Tuesday patch.

Microsoft initially [added support](https://www.theverge.com/news/677474/microsoft-windows-notepad-bold-italic-text-formatting-markdown-support) for Markdown, a plaintext formatting language, to Notepad on Windows 11 last May. The move contributed to [criticism that Microsoft](https://www.theverge.com/tech/870045/microsoft-windows-11-issues-rebuilding-trust-notepad) is filling its operating system with bloatware, including by stuffing new features and AI capabilities into [apps like Notepad](https://www.theverge.com/news/672984/microsoft-notepad-paint-snipping-tool-generative-ai-windows-insiders) and [Paint](https://www.theverge.com/news/866524/microsoft-paint-notepad-ai-coloring-book).

Notepad isn’t the only text editor that has faced security issues recently, [as the third-party Notepad++ app](https://www.theverge.com/tech/872462/notepad-plus-plus-server-hijacking) disclosed that some users may have downloaded a malicious update linked to Chinese state-sponsored attackers.
