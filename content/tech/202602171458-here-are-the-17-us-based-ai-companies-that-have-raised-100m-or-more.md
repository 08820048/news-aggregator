Nearly 20 U.S.-based AI startups have raised mega-rounds of $100 million or more in 2026 — and it’s been less than two months.  

If the first few weeks of 2026 are any indicator, the AI startup market is in for another year of monster funding rounds at eye-watering valuations. U.S. AI startups raised more than $76 billion through mega-rounds in 2025, per TechCrunch’s count.
