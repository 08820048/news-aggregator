The [Drop](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=50354&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fdrop.com%2Fhome) store, which was acquired by gaming gear giant [Corsair in 2023](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/17/23797338/corsair-drop-acquisition-mechanical-keyboards), was a haven for mechanical keyboard enthusiasts and audiophiles to discover and buy hard-to-find gear — sometimes at surprisingly good prices. The company will cease sales after March 25th at 11:59PM PT, which is also the cut off to redeem Drop Rewards. After March 31st, the site will be accessible for a limited time to view order history, but all retail functionality will shift to Corsair.

Corsair’s marketing manager Andrew Williams confirmed to _The Verge_ that several products featured on Drop will be integrated into Corsair’s site for purchase. Select others will be sold on Amazon and Best Buy. Other products will be end-of-life (EOL), particularly hardware collaborations including other companies.

When asked if products like Sennheiser or Koss headphone collaborations would move over to Corsair, Williams didn’t confirm or deny on a product-specific level, but stated that “almost all, if not all, of those will end up not being moved over.” He pointed out that Corsair, as a brand, has its own headsets and other products. However, Williams said “the main ones that are sell well and do well, we’re going to continue on Corsair.”

The Drop team was integrated into Corsair when it was acquired, according to Williams, and the company claims that no layoffs are happening as a result of this decision to wind down the site. Corsair shared that existing orders, including preorders, will be fulfilled as planned, and that the company will honor existing warranties on products.
