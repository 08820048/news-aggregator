Polestar says it will [release four new electric models over the next three years](https://media.polestar.com/us/en/media/pressreleases/695254/polestar-starts-largest-model-offensive-in-its-history-four-new-cars-in-three-years-5?utm_campaign=NewsAlert_15241&utm_medium=Email&utm_source=media.polestar.com), including a new SUV and a revamped version of its Polestar 2 sedan.

The Swedish automaker, which is owned by China’s Geely, said it will start delivering its [Polestar 5 grand tourer](https://www.theverge.com/electric-cars/773730/polestar-5-ev-horsepower-range-speed-specs) to customers this summer, followed by a new long-roof variant of its [Polestar 4](https://www.theverge.com/transportation/814717/polestar-4-review-specs-price-rear-windshield) in the fourth quarter. In early 2027, a “new successor” to [the Polestar 2](https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range) will go into production. And in 2028, the company is planning to release a compact premium SUV as [the Polestar 7](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345084/polestar-7-compact-suv-q3-2024-earnings-ev-sales).

The news comes after Polestar reported strong sales growth in 2025, with the automaker’s full-year sales reaching approximately 60,119 cars, a 34 percent increase over 2024. And while revenue for the first nine months of 2025 grew 49 percent to $2.17 billion, the company reported a significant net loss of $1.558 billion for the same period.

[Geely](https://www.theverge.com/transportation/874551/geely-volvo-china-cars-us-software-restrictions) has stepped up several times to back Polestar with equity investments and loan guarantees. Polestar is hoping that these lower cost updates — revamping the Polestar 4’s body, reviving the Polestar 2 — can continue to drive sales growth while reining in the company’s losses.

First on the list is the Polestar 5, which boasts 460 miles of range, an 800-volt architecture for ultra-fast charging, 884 horsepower, and 0-60mph in 3.1 seconds for the Performance trim. Polestar CEO Michael Longscheller calls the 5 “our brand halo car, bringing a new level of performance and luxury to the grand-tourer segment.” The four-door GT is expected to cost upwards of $120,000 when it’s released.

The Polestar 4, which is already sparking controversy with its lack of a rear windshield, is getting a makeover to turn it into more of an estate car, or station wagon, for European customers. “Sweden is famous for its estate cars, and its SUVs are world-class,” Longscheller says in a press release. “We are combining the space of an estate and the versatility of an SUV with the dynamic performance that is Polestar.”

Polestar stopped taking orders for the Polestar 2 last year, raising fears that it was discontinuing the EV that put the brand on the map. Now Longscheller says the company is working at “record speed” to bring the next-gen version of the 2 to market at the start of 2027.

Lastly, the Polestar 7 SUV will compete “the largest EV segment in Europe,” which is compact SUVs, Longscheller says: “We are convinced that we can offer customers a progressive performance-driven car for a very attractive price point, built in Europe.”
