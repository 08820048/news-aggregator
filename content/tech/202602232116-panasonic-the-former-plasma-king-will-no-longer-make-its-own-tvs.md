Panasonic, once revered for its plasma TVs, is giving up on making its own TV sets. Today, it announced that Chinese company Skyworth will take over manufacturing, marketing, and selling Panasonic-branded TVs.

Skyworth is a Shenzhen-headquartered TV brand. The company [claims](https://www.skyworthusa.com/pages/about) to be “a top three global provider of the Android TV platform.” In July, research firm Omdia [reported](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/skyworth-technology-drives-made-in-china-to-global-success--skyworth-ranks-among-the-worlds-top-5-tv-brands-302496642.html) that Skyworth was one of the top-five TV brands by sales revenue in Q1 2025; however, Skyworth hasn’t been able to maintain that position regularly.

Panasonic made its announcement at a “launch event,” [FlatpanelsHD](https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&id=1771867397) reported today. During the event, a Panasonic representative reportedly said:

> Under the agreement the new partner will lead sales, marketing, and logistics across the region, while Panasonic provide expertise and quality assurance to uphold its renowned audiovisual standards with full joint development on top-end OLED models.

Panasonic also said that it will provide support “for all Panasonic TVs sold up to March 2026 and all those available from April.”

Skyworth-made Panasonic TVs will be sold in the US and Europe. In the latter geography, the companies are aiming for double-digit market share.

## Panasonic’s wavering TV business

Panasonic has been wavering on its commitment to the TV business for at least 12 years.

When plasma ruled the living room, Panasonic dominated the market. In 2010, Panasonic [controlled 40.7 percent](https://www.hdtvtest.co.uk/news/panasonic-plasma-tv-market-201102091020) of the plasma panel market, beating Samsung (33.7 percent) and LG (23.2 percent), according to research from consultancy DisplaySearch. But in March 2014, [Panasonic quit making plasma TVs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/geoffreymorrison/2013/10/31/panasonic-to-exit-the-plasma-hdtv-business/), pointing to increasing interest in flat-screen LCD TVs and economic challenges derived from the [bankruptcy of global investment bank Lehman Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_Lehman_Brothers). At the time, Panasonic reportedly hadn’t made money off of its popular, high-contrast plasma TVs for years.
