summary: "A giant main floor window next to Kohler’s new recirculating shower system isn’t required. | Image: Kohler Kohler claims its new Anthem EvoCycle smart shower system can deliver \"up to 80% water savings\" without the use of showerheads that limit flow or pressure.

Kohler claims its new [Anthem EvoCycle smart shower system](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kohler-introduces-anthem-evocycle-smart-shower-a-breakthrough-recirculating-shower-system-designed-for-sustainable-living-302685684.html) can deliver “up to 80% water savings” without the use of showerheads that limit flow or pressure. The system instead relies on a reservoir in the shower’s base that collects used water and passes it through a filtration system before sending it back up through the showerhead. Pricing [starts at $7,500](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kohler.com%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Fshowers%2Fshop-shower-trims-valves%2Fanthem-evocycle-smart-shower-system-33481), or $5,625 with discounts, but you’ll need to buy fixtures and the [$825 water tank base](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kohler.com%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Fshowers%2Fshop-shower-bases%2Fanthem-evocycle-48-x-32-alcove-shower-base-right-drain-33480%3FskuId%3D33480-0) separately.

The Anthem EvoCycle’s recirculation system starts with a “Standard Mode” where only fresh water is delivered through a handshower sprayer and collected in the reservoir tank. Switching to “Cycle Mode” mixes a half gallon of that fresh water with dirty used water that’s sent through a closed loop filtration system before being pumped up to the showerhead. The system not only reduces water usage, but it can also potentially reduce energy usage by using the hot water heater less.

The Anthem EvoCycle will need access to power for the pump as well as its digital controller that connects to your smart home and a mobile app for remote operation. You’ll just need to ensure your bathroom can accommodate its pump system, which requires a 4.5-inch deep hole cut in the floor.
