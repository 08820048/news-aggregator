Sarah Bond, the president and COO of Xbox, is leaving the organization, [along with CEO of Microsoft Gaming Phil Spencer](https://www.theverge.com/news/882241/microsoft-phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement). Her departure is being announced at the same time as Spencer’s, with Asha Sharma moving into the EVP and CEO of Gaming role and Matt Booty being promoted to EVP and chief content officer.

Microsoft is making the changes as it is undergoing some dramatic shifts to its Xbox plans, including bringing [Windows and Xbox closer together](https://www.theverge.com/news/826695/microsoft-xbox-full-screen-experience-pc-laptop-tablet-windows-insider) to empower devices like [the Xbox Ally handheld](https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/763357/microsoft-asus-xbox-ally-handheld-hands-on-notepad) instead of relying entirely on first-party Xbox hardware. The company is also navigating increased [pressures on the Xbox business](https://www.theverge.com/news/805280/microsoft-xbox-gaming-profit-targets-layoffs), [major layoffs](https://www.theverge.com/news/693535/microsoft-layoffs-july-2025-xbox), and hits to [Xbox](https://www.theverge.com/news/696676/microsoft-forza-motorsport-turn-10-studios-layoffs-xbox-cuts) [studios](https://www.theverge.com/24151047/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-microsoft).

Bond joined Microsoft in 2017, initially serving as a CVP focused on gaming partnerships and business development. She was promoted to president of Xbox in 2023, with Spencer saying [in a memo at the time](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/26/23933447/microsoft-gaming-xbox-phil-spencer-leadership-changes-memo) that she would oversee teams including devices, player and creator experiences, strategy, and business planning.

Bond will be leaving Microsoft to start a “new chapter,” Spencer says in an internal memo. “Sarah has been instrumental during a defining period for Xbox, shaping our platform strategy, expanding Game Pass and cloud gaming, supporting new hardware launches, and guiding some of the most significant moments in our history,” Spencer says. “I’m grateful for her partnership and the impact she’s had, and I wish her the very best in what comes next.”
