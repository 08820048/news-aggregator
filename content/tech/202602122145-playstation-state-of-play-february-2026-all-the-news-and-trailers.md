summary: "Strap in, because the next PlayStation event is going to be a long one. Sony’s latest State of Play — a showcase event for upcoming PS5 games — kicks off on February 12th at 5PM ET and it’ll last more than an hour. We don’t know what exactly will be shown. Sony says that the event will include “news, gameplay updates, and announcements from game studios across the globe.” However, it sounds like one of the biggest upcoming PS5 games, Insomniac’s bloody take on Wolverine, might not make an appearance. Most likely the event will feature a mixture of some of Sony’s tentpole single-player experiences from studios like Naughty Dog, along with its continued (albeit scaled back) push into live-service games through upcoming titles like Horizon Hunters Gathering and Bungie’s return to Marathon. You can watch the event live on both Twitch and YouTube, and stay tuned here for all of the most important and interesting reveals and announcements. PlayStation’s next big State of Play is about to begin. PlayStation’s next big games showcase is on February 12th"

    [Nintendo](https://www.theverge.com/games/874282/nintendo-direct-february-2026-fallout-ff7) and [Xbox](https://www.theverge.com/games/865573/xbox-developer-direct-2026-the-biggest-games-and-announcements) each had their turn, and now PlayStation is up. [Sony just announced its next big State of Play showcase](https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/09/state-of-play-returns-this-thursday-february-12/), which will stream on February 12th at 5PM ET. There aren’t many details on what to expect, but Sony says that the event will be more than an hour long and include “eye-catching third-party and indie games headed to PS5, along with the latest from teams at PlayStation Studios.”
    
    That said, we can make some guesses for games that are likely to appear. _Saros_, [the sci-fi shooter from _Returnal_ developer Housemarque](https://www.theverge.com/news/785146/sony-playstation-saros-ps5-release-date-trailer-returnal-housemarque), is out in April, while Marvel games like [_Wolverine_ from Insomniac](https://www.theverge.com/news/611201/sony-playstation-5-ps5-wolverine-gameplay-trailer) and [_Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls_ from Arc System Works](https://www.theverge.com/games/711496/whens-marvel-pretty-soon) are both expected in 2026. Sony also just revealed [a multiplayer _Horizon Zero Dawn_ spinoff last week](https://www.theverge.com/games/874434/playstation-sony-horizon-hunters-gathering-live-service-ps5-pc), which seems like a good candidate to be featured, as does Bungie’s _Marathon_ [which is out in just over a month](https://www.theverge.com/news/864146/bungie-marathon-release-date-march-5th-price). It’s been a while since we heard much about [Naughty Dog’s _Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet_](https://www.theverge.com/24320197/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-trailer-game-awards-2024), as well.
