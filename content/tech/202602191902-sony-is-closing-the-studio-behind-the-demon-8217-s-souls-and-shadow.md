Sony is shutting down Bluepoint Games, the PlayStation studio behind well-received remakes of games like _Shadow of the Colossus_ and _Demon’s Souls_, [according to _Bloomberg_](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-19/sony-is-shutting-down-the-playstation-studio-bluepoint?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MTUyNzAyNiwiZXhwIjoxNzcyMTMxODI2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQVBZWlBLR0lGUFkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.utABYnI4m_K6kqNqybZarBQ9T5WW_aWCH6NI3kt8Q64). The change was made “following a recent business review,” a spokesperson told the publication. About 70 staffers will be cut, and the studio will shut down in March.

“Bluepoint Games is an incredibly talented team and their technical expertise has delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community,” a spokesperson told _Bloomberg_. “We thank them for their passion, creativity and craftmanship.” Sony didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.

Sony acquired Bluepoint Games [in 2021](https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22665426/sony-buys-bluepoint-games-remake-remaster-demons-souls-shadow-ico-uncharted) following a string of successful updates to many PlayStation franchises, including remasters of the [first three _Uncharted_ titles](https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/14/9529389/uncharted-nathan-drake-collection-review-playstation-4) and [of _Gravity Rush_](https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/26/10777180/gravity-rush-remastered-review-sony-ps4). But after Sony’s purch_ase,_ the company appears to have set the studio on a different course than the remakes and remasters that made it a powerhouse: it co-developed 2022’s _God of War: Ragnarok_, then spent years working on an unannounced live service _God of War_ game [that Sony canceled in January](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345575/sony-god-of-war-bluepoint-games-bend-games-canceled).

Bluepoint is just the latest PlayStation studio affected by major changes in recent years. Sony [closed down _Concord_ developer Firewalk Studios](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios) in 2024 shortly after [the game’s disastrous launch](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234909/sony-concord-ps5-shutdown-poor-sales-launch-pc). At that same time, it announced the shutdown of mobile studio Neon Koi, too. In 2024, Bungie [also laid off 220 employees](https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/31/24210476/bungie-to-layoff-220-employees-new-project) and moved others into Sony Interactive Entertainment.
