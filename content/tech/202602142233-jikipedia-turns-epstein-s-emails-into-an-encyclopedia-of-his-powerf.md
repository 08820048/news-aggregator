The folks behind [Jmail](https://www.theverge.com/news/826901/jeffrey-epstein-files-emails-gmail-jmail) are at it again with a [clone of Wikipedia](https://jmail.world/wiki) that turns the treasure trove of data in Epstein’s emails into [detailed dossiers](https://x.com/jmailarchive/status/2022482688691835121) on his associates. Entries include known visits to Epstein’s properties, possible knowledge of Epstein’s crimes, and laws that they might have broken. The reports are dense, listing how many emails they exchanged with Epstein, basic biographical information, and details about how they’re connected.

Beyond that, there are entries for the [properties](https://jmail.world/wiki/zorro-ranch) [Epstein](https://jmail.world/wiki/palm-beach-estate) [owns](https://jmail.world/wiki/little-st-james), detailing how they were acquired and the alleged activities that took place there. There are also entries for his business dealings, including his relationship with [JPMorgan Chase](https://jmail.world/wiki/jpmorgan-banking).

It is worth noting that the entries are AI-generated. While a casual glance seems to suggest Jikipedia is citing its sources, it’s still possible (if not likely) that there are some inaccuracies contained within them. The Jmail X account said that they’ll be implementing the ability for users to [report inaccuracies and request changes soon](https://x.com/jmailarchive/status/2022482696346440160).
