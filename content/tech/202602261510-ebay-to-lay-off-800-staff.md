eBay is cutting around 800 jobs, or 6% of its full-time employees.

“We are taking steps to reinvest across our business and align our structure with our strategic priorities, which will affect certain roles across our workforce,” the company said in a statement. “We are grateful for the contributions of the employees impacted and are committed to supporting them with care and respect.”

[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-26/ebay-is-laying-off-about-800-workers-6-of-global-workforce) first reported the news.

The move comes a week after eBay said it [would acquire Depop](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/18/etsy-sells-secondhand-clothing-marketplace-depop-to-ebay-for-1-2b/), a second-hand clothing app popular with Gen Z and millennials, from Etsy for $1.2 billion in cash.

eBay last week reported [fourth-quarter](https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-results/) results, with revenue rising 15% to $3 billion, exceeding analysts’ expectations.

This round of layoffs marks the third time eBay has cut jobs in the past three years. In early 2024, it cut 1,000 jobs, or about 9% of its workforce. In early 2023, it laid off about 500 employees, or about 4% of its headcount.
