summary: "Whether you’re considering a 16-inch gaming laptop, or a more compact 14-inch model, there’s a deal with your name on it happening right now at Best Buy. The 2025 models of Acer’s Predator Helios Neo 16S and the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 are hundreds off, although it’s the model with the bigger screen that is currently the cheaper of the two. The sale on the Neo 16S will expire at the end of the day, while the Zephyrus G14 discount will likely be available through President’s Day. Starting with the popular Zephyrus G14, which has a 3K resolution Pantone-validated OLED that can display up to a 120Hz refresh rate, you can get a high-end configuration at Best Buy for $1,899.99, down from its original price of $2,399.99. In addition to great screen specs, it has AMD’s Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor — one of the fastest available on a laptop — plus Nvidia’s RTX 5070 Ti GPU with 12GB of VRAM, 32GB of LPDDR5 RAM clocked at 8,000MHz and a 1TB SSD. This model is ideal for those who want to be able to play any 2026 title at great frame rates without any (or many) compromises to visual fidelity. For context on the price, Best Buy is offering the step-down configuration for $100 less, with a slightly worse CPU, a significantly less capable GPU (the RTX 5060), and half the RAM. You’re getting a lot of extra power with the discounted model at $1,899.99. Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 Where to Buy: $2399.99 $1899.99 at Best Buy The Acer Predator Helios Neo 16S is bigger and has a larger OLED screen, yet on the whole it’s still fairly thin for a gaming laptop. And, it starts at $1,469.99, down from $1,899.99 at Best Buy. It has comparable specs to the Zephyrus G14 — a capable processor in the Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX, the RTX 5070 Ti, 32GB of DDR5 6,400MHz RAM, a 1TB SSD — but its 16-inch screen is slightly lower res at 2560 x 1600 (albeit with a 240Hz refresh rate) versus 2880 x 1800 in the Zephyrus G14. Either way, you’ve got two great potential upgrades to consider. Acer Predator Helios Neo 16S Where to Buy: $1899.99 $1469.99 at Best Buy"
