summary: "Monday, February 16th, is Presidents Day, and there are plenty of good deals happening on tech in the run-up to the holiday. Even if you don’t snag any huge upgrades, though, you likely already own multiple gadgets that you need to recharge each and every day. It would sure be nice to be able to charge two devices at once, and you can do just that with Anker’s braided, two-headed USB-C cable — which is available from Amazon or Anker in black or white for $15.99 ($4 off). Anker 2-in-1 USB C to USB C Cable 140W (six-foot) Where to Buy: $19.99 $15.99 at Amazon (black) $19.99 $15.99 at Amazon (white) $19.99 $15.99 at Anker (with code WS7DV2LASIFH) The six-foot cable’s usefulness speaks for itself, but I’ve been surprised by how much of a game-changer it’s been for me at home. My wife and I stow our laptops and iPad Air near an outlet, and it’s nice not to have to argue over who gets to charge their gadget first. We can plug the two ends of the cable into the devices we deem most important to charge throughout the day. It also supports 140W passthrough to a single device, if you have a wall adapter that can push that much juice, and automatically allocates power to the device that needs it most."
