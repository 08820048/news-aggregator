is a senior policy reporter at The Verge, covering the intersection of Silicon Valley and Capitol Hill. She spent 5 years covering tech policy at CNBC, writing about antitrust, privacy, and content moderation reform.

Gail Slater, the top antitrust enforcer at the Justice Department, announced Thursday that she has left her post, just weeks before the agency’s next major tech monopoly [trial against entertainment giant Live Nation](https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24163083/live-nation-ticketmaster-doj-monopoly-lawsuit-break-up) is set to begin.

“It is with great sadness and abiding hope that I leave my role as AAG for Antitrust today,” Slater [posted from her personal X account](https://x.com/gailaslater/status/2021979193949716727). Slater thanked the staff of the Antitrust Division and called the role “the honor of a lifetime.” In a statement, Attorney General Pam Bondi thanked Slater for her service, but did not directly address questions about what precipitated her departure or who would take over as the acting leader of the Division.

[Slater’s nomination](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313285/trump-sec-doj-antitrust-nominees-paul-atkins-gail-slater) to the position shortly after Trump’s election drew bipartisan support, but her time at the Justice Department was [marked with internal strife](https://www.theverge.com/policy/717303/justice-department-antitrust-division-slater-alford-rinner-firing). Last year, two of her top deputies were terminated amid a clash with Bondi’s then-chief of staff Chad Mizelle over [lobbyists’ reported role](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/top-trump-administration-antitrust-official-faces-criticism-over-approach-sources-say/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) in ushering through approval of a wireless networking merger. The DOJ claimed at the time that Roger Alford and Bill Rinner were fired for “insubordination,” but [Alford later spoke out](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5458361-doj-lobbyist-influence-claims/) about what he termed “MAGA-in-name-only lobbyists” who he said were enabled by select DOJ officials who have “perverted justice and acted inconsistent with the rule of law.”

Slater’s time at the Justice Department was marked with internal strife

More recently, [Slater was “sidelined”](https://www.theverge.com/policy/875665/live-nation-ticketmaster-settlement-doj-discussions-monopoly-trial) from negotiations with executives and lobbyists for Live Nation as its March 2nd trial date approaches, [_Semafor_ reported](https://www.semafor.com/article/02/08/2026/live-nation-settlement-talks-are-dividing-trumps-justice-department). Instead, senior DOJ officials were reportedly communicating with company representatives. An unnamed DOJ spokesperson told _Semafor_ at the time that its report “contains misinformation about an ongoing matter that is confidential, but what can be said is that AAG Slater is very much involved.”

The DOJ Antitrust Division has several other high profile and ongoing tech cases on its plate. The agency recently [filed a cross-appeal of the Google search monopoly decision](https://www.theverge.com/tech/873438/google-antitrust-case-doj-states-appeal), which included remedies short of the Chrome sale it asked for, and it’s [awaiting a remedies ruling](https://www.theverge.com/news/826796/google-ad-tech-closing-arguments) in the separate Google ad tech monopolization case. The agency also inherited a major [monopolization case against Apple](https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/21/24105363/apple-doj-monopoly-lawsuit) from the Biden administration, which is heading toward trial. And after President Donald Trump initially [said he would be involved](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/08/trump-netflix-wbd-paramount.html) in hashing out details of [Netflix’s proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery](https://www.theverge.com/news/839007/netflix-warner-acquisition) and Paramount’s competing bid, he [recently said](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/04/trump-wbd-netflix-paramount-skydance.html) he’d stay out of it and that “the Justice Department will handle it.”
