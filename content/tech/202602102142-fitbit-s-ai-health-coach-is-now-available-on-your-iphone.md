The update tests a [major overhaul of Fitbit’s app](https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/761965/fitbits-ai-health-coach-is-the-first-i-might-actually-be-interested-in), introducing a conversational interface with a Gemini-powered AI that interprets your latest results, creates custom routines and workouts based on users’ personal health goals, workout equipment, and training preferences. It [initially launched in October](https://www.theverge.com/tech/806243/fitbit-ai-health-coach-app-update-preview), when it was only available in the US and only on Android devices.

To try out the feature, users need to have an active Fitbit Premium subscription and [use a Google account](https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/871218/fitbit-account-migration-google-deadline-may-2026) to sign into the Fitbit app. They also need to use one of the 14 [currently-supported devices](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/16678124#supportedcountryanddevice&zippy=%2Csupported-countries-and-devices), which include Fitbit’s wearables, as well as the Pixel Watch.
