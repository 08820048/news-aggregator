Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr is [urging broadcasters](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-418890A1.pdf) to air “patriotic, pro-America content” in celebration of the US’s 250th anniversary. The initiative, called the “Pledge America Campaign,” encourages broadcasters to run public service announcements, short segments, or specials to promote “civic education, inspiring local stories, and American history.”

Carr says broadcasters can “voluntarily choose to indicate their commitment” to the campaign by doing things like starting the day with the “Star Spangled Banner” or Pledge of Allegiance, broadcasting daily programming to highlight historical events, as well as showcasing historically significant sites during news segments, such as national parks.

With any other administration, this may have been just a standard announcement. But President Donald Trump and his officials have [made their view about what’s important](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/restoring-truth-and-sanity-to-american-history/) in American history very clear. The Trump administration has already moved to erase portions of American history in a bid to [end “radical indoctrination”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-indoctrination-in-k-12-schooling/) in schools and [remove “woke” exhibits](https://www.axios.com/2025/08/22/smithsonian-museums-white-house-woke-exhibits) from [the Smithsonian](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/08/president-trump-is-right-about-the-smithsonian/).

The FCC’s campaign stems from the Trump administration’s “Task Force 250,” which asks the federal, state, and local governments to participate in the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence on July 4th, 2026. “I look forward to broadcasters showcasing its \[America’s\] inspiring history by taking the Pledge and fulfilling their public interest mandate to serve the needs and interests of their local communities.”
