Apple is [upgrading its Podcasts app](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/02/apple-introduces-a-new-video-podcast-experience-on-apple-podcasts/) to let users “seamlessly” swap between audio and video podcasts using its HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) technology. While listening to a show, users will be able to switch to a horizontal video version of the podcast and download the video versions of a podcast for offline viewing.

By giving users the option to quickly change between audio and video, Apple might be able to keep users from jumping to other platforms to watch episodes of their favorite shows. Video is becoming an increasingly popular way to consume podcasts, with YouTube saying last February that more than 1 billion people watch podcasts on the platform [every month](https://www.theverge.com/news/619720/youtube-podcasts-one-billion-monthly-views). Spotify is making a [big push into video as well](https://www.theverge.com/column/837829/spotify-video-service), and Netflix recently launched [its own original podcasts](https://www.theverge.com/news/861971/netflix-original-podcasts-pete-davidson-michael-irvin) and has licensed shows from [Spotify](https://www.theverge.com/news/799582/netflix-spotify-video-podcast-deal) and [iHeartMedia](https://www.theverge.com/news/845307/netflix-iheartmedia-video-podcasts).

The new features in Apple’s Podcasts app will officially launch this spring, but they will be available to test starting Monday as part of betas for iOS 26.4, iPadOS 26.4, and visionOS 26.4. HLS video will also come to the web version of the Podcasts app in the spring. Apple says that video will integrate “seamlessly into existing shows without disrupting followers or downloads, and creators can monetize through sponsorships and dynamic advertising.”
