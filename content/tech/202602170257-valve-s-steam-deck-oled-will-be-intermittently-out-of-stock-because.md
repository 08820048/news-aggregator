Valve has updated the [Steam Deck website](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsteamdeck) to say that the Steam Deck OLED may be out of stock “intermittently in some regions due to memory and storage shortages.” The PC gaming handheld has been out of stock in the US and other parts of the world for [a few days](https://www.theverge.com/games/877716/where-is-the-steam-deck-oled), and thanks to this update, we now know why.

The update comes shortly after [Valve delayed](https://www.theverge.com/games/874196/valve-steam-machine-frame-controller-delay-pricing-memory-crisis) the Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller from a planned shipping window of early 2026 because of the memory and storage crunch. “We have work to do to land on concrete pricing and launch dates that we can confidently announce, being mindful of how quickly the circumstances around both of those things can change,” Valve said [in a post about that announcement](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fgroup%2F45479024%2Fview%2F625565405086220583%3Fl%3Denglish) from earlier this month.

Its goal is to launch that new hardware sometime in the first half of 2026, and the company is working to finalize its plans “as soon as possible.”

Valve’s website also notes that the company no longer produces the 256GB LCD Steam Deck, a change that the company [announced late last year](https://www.theverge.com/news/848595/the-lcd-steam-deck-is-done).
