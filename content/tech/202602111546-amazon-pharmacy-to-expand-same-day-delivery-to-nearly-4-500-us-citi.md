Amazon Pharmacy, the retail giant’s online pharmacy, plans to bring same-day prescription delivery to almost 4,500 U.S. cities and towns by the end of this year, adding nearly 2,000 new communities to its network. The expansion will cover customers in newly served states such as Idaho and Massachusetts, the company [announced](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-pharmacy-same-day-delivery-medication-expansion) on Wednesday.

Amazon launched Amazon Pharmacy in 2020, two years after its $753 million [acquisition](https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/28/amazon-buys-pillpack-an-online-pharmacy-that-was-rumored-to-be-talking-to-walmart/) of prescription medicine delivery service PillPack. In 2023, Amazon launched [RxPass](https://pharmacy.amazon.com/rxpass), a service that offers Prime members in the U.S. as many generic versions of medications as they need for a $5 monthly fee.

“Patients shouldn’t have to choose between speed, cost, and convenience when it comes to their medication, regardless of where they live,” said John Love, vice president of Amazon Pharmacy, in a [press release](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-pharmacy-same-day-delivery-medication-expansion). “By combining our pharmacy expertise with our logistics network, we’re removing critical barriers and helping patients start treatment faster—setting a new standard for accessible, digital-forward pharmacy care.”

In October, the e-commerce giant [debuted prescription vending machines](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/08/amazon-pharmacy-is-launching-vending-machines-for-prescription-drugs/) at its One Medical clinics. The in-office kiosks, which are operated by Amazon Pharmacy, let patients pick up their prescriptions immediately after their appointment.
