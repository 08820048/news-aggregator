Ultrahuman is expanding its health monitoring ecosystem with the launch of a new flagship smart ring and a “biointelligence AI” platform upgrade. The Ring Pro is Ultrahuman’s third-generation smart ring, and promises up to 15 days of battery life before needing to recharge, alongside 250 days of on-device health history storage.

Those are some significant improvements compared to its predecessor, the [2023 Ring Air](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259284/oura-ring-samsung-galaxy-ring-ultrahuman-ring-air-ringconn-circular-ring-evie-ring-review-wearables#:~:text=The%20%24349%20Ultrahuman%20Ring%20Air), which provides 4-6 days of battery life and several days of offline data storage, according to [user](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultrahuman/comments/1liaws5/comment/mzis0wg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) [estimates](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultrahuman/comments/1bcxr5a/comment/kuive7h/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Ultrahuman has also made other upgrades to the Ring Pro, including a redesigned heart-rate sensor that improves signal during sleep and recovery, a faster dual-core processor, and safety improvements that allow the ring to be cut off fingers more easily in an emergency.

The Ultrahuman Ring Pro will ship with a new Pro Charging case that provides an additional 45 days of battery life and stores up to one year of ring data. The case features an integrated speaker and proximity tracker that allow users to find the device via the Ultrahuman app, wireless charging, and an LED indicator that displays battery level status.

The Ring Pro comes in gold, silver, black, and titanium color options, and is available in sizes 5-14. Preorders are launching today for $479 with global availability — _except_ in the United States, where Ultrahuman is clashing with patents from rival smart ring provider Oura. Shipments start in March.

The rollout of Jade, Ultrahuman’s new AI platform upgrade, doesn’t exclude the US, and will be available to all global Ultrahuman users. Ultrahuman says that Jade is “the world’s first real-time biointelligence AI,” capable of pulling health data insights and actioning breathwork and atrial fibrillation (AFIB) detection tasks. Future updates will allow Jade to do “much more,” according to Ultrahuman, including proactively flagging health concerns before they occur, controlling smart home functions like adjusting room temperature, and even ordering food.

Ultrahuman says the goal is to have Jade serve as an “autonomous health agent working 24x7 to improve your life,“ but it hasn’t specified when these additional features will be available.
