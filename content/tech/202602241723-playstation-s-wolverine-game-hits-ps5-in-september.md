_Marvel’s Wolverine_, the next superhero game from _Marvel’s Spider-Man_ developer Insomniac Games, will be released on PS5 [on September 15th](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMU9iACrRO8).

Insomniac announced that it would be making a Wolverine game [way back in 2021](https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665529/insomniac-wolverine-ps5), so it’s been a long wait in the leadup to an official release date. Sony gave a vague fall 2026 release window last year alongside a [very bloody gameplay trailer](https://youtu.be/s3pDMUWlA6I?si=MAc9bbbTk2LJGsf4).

“In this original story, Wolverine is on the hunt to uncover the secrets of a dark past that keeps eluding him,” according to [the game’s PlayStation Store listing](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvels-wolverine/). “His search for answers will send him on perilous excursions to exotic locales, including the island nation of Madripoor, the frosted wilderness of Canada and the narrow city streets of Tokyo – all potential battlegrounds for fierce, bloody, destructive action.”

_Wolverine_ isn’t the only Marvel-themed title Sony is working on for this year; the company is also publishing [_Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls_](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls/#all-notices), a fighting game that’s set to launch on August 6th.
