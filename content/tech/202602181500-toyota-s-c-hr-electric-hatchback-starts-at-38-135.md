Toyota is on an EV roll these days, introducing [the newly all-electric, three-row Highlander SUV](https://www.theverge.com/transportation/875906/toyota-highlander-ev-suv-range-specs), and giving us a fuller picture of [the bZ Woodland wagon](https://www.theverge.com/transportation/878849/toyota-bz-woodland-specs-price-ev-offroad). Now, the Japanese auto giant is completing the triumvirate with a full detail breakdown of [the upcoming C-HR hatchback](https://www.theverge.com/electric-cars/628106/toyota-electric-c-hr-europe-bz4x-update-range-power-faster-charging).

We already knew that [the C-HR](https://www.theverge.com/news/666207/toyota-chr-electric-ev-us-photo-specs) won’t be as affordable as we originally thought, coming in at $38,135 (including destination fee) for the base SE trim. That’s a lot more than the $25,000-$30,000 some experts were expecting, but definitely a lot less than the $50,000 average transaction price for a new vehicle (or $55,000 for average EV). By comparison, the original gas-engine version of the C-HR started at $22,000, while the hybrid model sells for around $41,000.

**1/15**

But while it may not be as approachable as we once assumed, the C-HR aims to make up for it in variety. Toyota [says is releasing a variety of powertrain options for the C-HR](https://pressroom.toyota.com/toyota-debuts-stylish-powerful-2026-c-hr-battery-electric-vehicle/), including hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and hydrogen fuel cell (only available in California and Hawaii).

The exterior design stands out with its “hammerhead” front end and a wide, planted stance that emphasizes its sportiness. Built on the dedicated e-TNGA platform, the C-HR offers a low center of gravity that enhances the drive quality. A dual-motor all-wheel-drive system comes standard, delivering 338 horsepower and a 0-60 mph acceleration in just 4.9 seconds.

The SE trim offers an EPA-estimated range of up to 287 miles, while the XSE trim, equipped with larger 20-inch wheels, provides an estimated 273 miles. A NACS charging port enables owners to charge at Tesla’s Supercharger network. Under ideal conditions, the 74.7 kWh battery can charge from 10-80 percent in approximately 30 minutes.

The inside features a 14-inch touchscreen running the latest Toyota Audio Multimedia system, which includes wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. (Early reviews of [Toyota’s new software system have not been favorable](https://insideevs.com/reviews/787449/toyota-bz-woodland-ev-review-2026/).) And while the C-HR may be small, it hopefully won’t be cramped, with up to 59.5 cubic feet of cargo space when the rear seats are folded flat.

The C-HR is expected to go on sale in March 2026, around the same time as the bZ Woodland. And once the Highlander arrives later this year, Toyota will suddenly have three EVs to sell to American car buyers. Perhaps its time to finally retire those “Toyota is an EV laggard” takes?
