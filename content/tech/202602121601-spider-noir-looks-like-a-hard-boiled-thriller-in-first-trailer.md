Today, Amazon dropped a new trailer for its upcoming Spider-Noir starring Nicolas Cage as a brooding Spider-Man variant.

Though it’s going to be a while before we see more of [Sony’s animated _Spider-Verse_](https://www.theverge.com/film/710666/beyond-the-spider-verse-delay-june-25) or [Marvel’s live-action take on Peter Parker](https://www.theverge.com/film/717307/spider-man-brand-new-day-teaser-posts-nine-seconds-of-tom-hollands-new-outfit), Amazon’s [_Spider-Noir_ series](https://www.theverge.com/news/665490/heres-spider-noir) is right around the corner.

Today, Amazon dropped a new trailer for its upcoming _Spider-Noir_ starring Nicolas Cage as a brooding Spider-Man variant. Set in an alternate reality where it’s still the 1930s, _Spider-Noir_ follows private investigator Ben Reilly (Cage) as he gets back into the crimefighting game as the hero known as “The Spider.” As his city’s only superhero, Reilly knows that he’s the only person with the necessary skills to deal with threats like mob boss Silvermane (Brendan Gleeson). But as a man still reeling from a personal tragedy, it’s hard for Reilly to get back into the heroic swing of things.

In addition to featuring shots of club owner Cat Hardy (Li Jun Li) and reporter Robbie Robertson (Lamorne Morris), the black and white trailer (there’s also [a version that’s in color](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-Blr0_koQA), and the series will be streamed both ways) gives you a strong sense of the moody tone and dark aesthetic _Spider-Noir_ is going to lean into. For some reason, Amazon is debuting the show on MGM Plus on May 25th before it hits Prime Video on the 27th. It’s not clear if the show will feature any connections to the rest of Sony’s universe of Spider-projects, but _Spider-Noir_ looks like it could be pretty solid.
