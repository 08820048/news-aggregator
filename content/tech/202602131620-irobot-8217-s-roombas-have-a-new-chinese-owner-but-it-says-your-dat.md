As part of its acquisition by China-based Picea Robotics, iRobot is creating a new US-based subsidiary called iRobot Safe, which [the company says](https://media.irobot.com/2026-01-23-iRobot-Completes-Court-Supervised-Transaction-with-Picea,-Enabling-the-Next-Chapter-of-Growth) will be “responsible for the protection of US consumer data,” similar to [the TikTok deal](https://www.theverge.com/tech/866437/tiktok-usds-bytedance-sale-oracle-mgx) that was completed last month. iRobot customers in the US will be able to continue using their robovacs as usual, but now their data will be handled by iRobot Safe, rather than the company’s new owner.

In a [press release](https://media.irobot.com/2026-01-23-iRobot-Completes-Court-Supervised-Transaction-with-Picea,-Enabling-the-Next-Chapter-of-Growth) published on January 23rd, iRobot stated that the creation of iRobot Safe is “designed to maintain a clear separation between iRobot’s non-US ownership and its US and other global consumer data.” The new subsidiary will have its own US-based board, CEO, and data security officer. iRobot will also still be based out of its current headquarters in Bedford, Massachusetts, but is now wholly privately owned by Picea.

The addition of iRobot Safe comes a little over a month after iRobot [filed for bankruptcy](https://www.theverge.com/news/844460/irobot-files-for-bankruptcy) in December, when it also announced it would be [acquired by Picea Robotics](https://www.theverge.com/news/844474/who-is-picea-robotics-company-owns-irobot), following an attempted acquisition by Amazon that [fell through](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/31/24057077/irobot-amazon-deal-collapse-roomba-uncertain-future) in 2024.
