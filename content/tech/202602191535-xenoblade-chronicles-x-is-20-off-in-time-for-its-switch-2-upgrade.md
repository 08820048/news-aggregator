summary: "Nintendo just released a Switch 2 upgrade for Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition. The upgrade is $4.99 for owners of the Switch game, or $64.99 if you buy the Switch 2 version. Don’t buy the Switch 2 version! Instead, score a deal on the digital Switch version that’s $39.99 (originally $59.99) at GameStop and Amazon. Then, make the upgrade for another $5. The physical version is discounted, too, but buying digitally is the fastest way to jump in. Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition Where to Buy: $59.99 $39.99 at Amazon (digital) $59.99 $39.99 at GameStop (digital) Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition is far from the only Switch game that’s discounted right now. GameStop, Amazon, and Walmart are offering several first-party games at up to $30 off, including Princess Peach: Showtime, Super Mario RPG, The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening, and more. Better yet, some of those games have received Switch 2 upgrades that don’t cost extra."
