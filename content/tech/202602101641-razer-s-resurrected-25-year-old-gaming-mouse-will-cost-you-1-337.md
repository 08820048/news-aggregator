Nostalgia’s getting expensive. When [Razer announced last December it would be relaunching the world’s first gaming mouse](https://www.theverge.com/news/841494/razer-boomslang-20th-anniversary-edition-gaming-mouse-rechargeable-optical) with a few modern upgrades, it didn’t reveal how much the Razer Boomslang 20th Anniversary Edition would cost or when it would be released. The company [will officially open preorders](https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice%2Frazer-boomslang-20th-anniversary-edition%2FRZ83-02530100-B3M1) for the mouse on February 10th at 8AM PT for those in the US. In Europe, preorders will start on February 11th at 8AM CET, while in Asia it will be February 11th at 8AM SGT. The production run is still being limited to just 1,337 units in total, but with a matching $1,337 price tag, they might not fly off shelves.

The original version of the mouse, called the [Kärna Razer Boomslang](https://www.theverge.com/23050951/razer-co-founder-robert-krakoff-death-razerguy), launched before gaming-specific peripherals were even a thing. It distinguished itself from other mice on the market at the time with an upgraded encoding wheel that offered more accurate mouse tracking, giving gamers a potential competitive advantage.

The 20th Anniversary Edition of the Razer Boomslang replaces those mechanical components with a 45,000 DPI optical sensor. The original mouse’s symmetrical ambidextrous design has been carried forward, but the new Boomslang is now wireless with an 8,000Hz polling rate and comes with a Razer Mouse Dock Pro wireless charging stand. You’ll also find 9-zone customizable RGB lighting on the underside of the new Boomslang that can be synced to over 300 games; a feature the Razer brand has become known for.

A quarter century ago the Kärna Razer Boomslang was priced at $69.99 to $99.99, [according to _Eurogamer_](https://www.eurogamer.net/rbs2k). The new version’s $1,337 price far outpaces inflation, but Razer is sweetening the pot by including an LED lit display frame featuring a deconstructed look at the Razer Boomslang 20th Anniversary Edition’s internal components.
