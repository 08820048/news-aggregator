summary: "YouTubers are no longer just creators, and in some cases, their side businesses are growing faster than their channels."
---
YouTube has become the biggest platform out there, offering tons of opportunities for creators to earn a living. Back in June, the company [reported](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/youtube-says-its-ecosystem-created-490k-jobs-and-added-55b-to-the-us-gdp-in-2024/) that its creative ecosystem added over $55 billion to the U.S. GDP and created more than 490,000 full-time jobs.

However, many YouTubers have reduced their reliance on ad revenue and brand deals. There are several reasons for this shift. First, ad revenue can be unpredictable. With YouTube continually updating its policies, some creators find it challenging to secure ads for their videos, which can negatively impact their earnings. They’ve also realized that income from these streams can vanish unexpectedly.

Recognizing the volatility of platform-dependent revenue, many YouTubers are no longer just creators. They’re vertically integrated media companies with parallel businesses, including product lines, brick-and-mortar ventures, and consumer brands that can outlast algorithm changes and policy shifts.

In some cases, these side businesses are growing faster and more sustainably than their YouTube channels.

Jimmy Donaldson, known as MrBeast, who has 442 million subscribers, isn’t just one of the platform’s biggest creators — he’s its most aggressive entrepreneur.

In November 2025, for example, The Times [reported](https://www.thetimes.com/us/news-today/article/mr-beast-theme-park-beast-land-saudi-arabia-lsff6t2b8) that the YouTuber is set to open a theme park in Saudi Arabia, with rides inspired by his video content. Among other features, there will supposedly be a game where six players stand on trap doors and must press a button when it lights up or fall down.

MrBeast is also venturing into telecommunications. He plans to establish a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), which could involve partnering with one of the major operators, such as AT&T, T-Mobile, or Verizon.

Additionally, the YouTuber was spotted filing a trademark application for a mobile app that offers banking, financial advisory, and crypto exchange services. In February 2026, MrBeast announced the [acquisition of Step](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/09/mrbeasts-company-buys-gen-z-focused-fintech-app-step/), the banking app targeted toward Gen Z users.

But there’s so much more. What started with a merchandise store in 2018 — ShopMrBeast — has exploded into a broad business portfolio, including his now three-year-old snack brand, Feastables.

Feastables’ initial product was the “MrBeast Bar,” a chocolate bar that generated over [$10 million](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-youtuber-mrbeast-feastables-uses-giveaways-data-to-sell-chocolate-2022-5) in sales within its first 72 hours, selling over 1 million bars at launch. As of today, Feastables is more profitable than his YouTube content and even his “Beast Games” competition series on Prime Video. In 2024, Feastables generated roughly [$250 million](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-10/mrbeast-makes-more-money-from-feastables-chocolate-than-youtube) in revenue and over $20 million in profit, while his media business lost approximately $80 million.

Other ventures include his packaged food brand Lunchly (co-founded with YouTubers Logan Paul and KSI), the toy line MrBeast Lab, [MrBeast Burger](https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/01/youtube-star-mrbeast-sues-ghost-kitchen-behind-mrbeast-burger/), and the analytics platform [Viewstats](https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/14/mrbeasts-analytics-platform-viewstats-is-out-in-beta/). He even [attempted](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/mr-beast-is-reportedly-now-among-those-trying-to-buy-tiktok/) to [buy the U.S. operations of TikTok](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/26/heres-whats-happening-right-now-with-the-us-tiktok-deal/) by joining the American Investor Consortium, a group of investors led by Employer.com founder Jesse Tinsley.

[Emma Chamberlain](https://www.youtube.com/@emmachamberlain), who rose to fame as a teen vlogger in 2016, now has over 12 million subscribers and has found success in the beverage industry.

She launched her coffee brand, Chamberlain Coffee, in 2019, which offers a variety of products, including cold brew, coffee pods, ground and whole bean options, as well as tea and matcha. Notably, other YouTubers have followed suit, such as [Jacksepticeye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQA8VDDwPpo) with his Top of the Mornin’ Coffee brand and [Philip DeFranco](https://www.instagram.com/p/CwyXgLwvMat/) with Wake & Make Coffee.

In 2023, Chamberlain Coffee had a significant year, introducing [ready-to-drink canned lattes](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/01/youtube-emma-chamberlain-coffee-commerce/) and reaching approximately $20 million in revenue, according to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexyork/2024/04/19/the-secret-behind-emma-chamberlains-20-million-coffee-companyand-her-plans-to-return-to-youtube/). The brand recently experienced even more substantial growth, [opening its first physical location](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/emerging-brands/influencer-emma-chamberlain-launches-la-cafe) in January. Previously, it had only an online and retail presence at places like Target, Sprouts, and Walmart. 

Although Chamberlain Coffee faced some challenges in 2024 due to supplier issues, it’s expected to rebound, with projected revenue growth of over 50% by 2025, reaching more than $33 million, according to [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/emma-chamberlain-coffee-expansion-plans-detailed-in-leaked-deck-2025-3). The brand is also aiming for profitability by 2026.

## Logan Paul

[Logan Paul](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG8rbF3g2AMX70yOd8vqIZg) (23.6 million subscribers) is now known for his wrestling career but was earlier known for numerous controversies, like an infamous 2017 video and an [allegedly scammy NFT project](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/06/youtuber-logan-pauls-cryptozoo-nft-project-is-a-total-mess/), CryptoZoo. 

He also gained attention through his energy drink brand, Prime, which achieved rapid viral success in 2022. The brand, co-founded by YouTuber KSI, surpassed [$1.2 billion in sales](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-08/prime-drinks-from-logan-paul-and-ksi-set-to-pass-1-2-billion-in-sales) in 2023, a figure far exceeding what most content creators earn from views, ads, and brand deals. However, it has since faced declining sales, regulatory scrutiny for its high caffeine content, and lawsuits from business partners. Sales have particularly cooled in the U.K., where [revenue dropped by about 70%](https://www.businessinsider.com/logan-paul-ksi-prime-energy-drink-sales-decline-2025-6) from 2023 to 2024.

Another venture of his, Maverick Apparel, made between [$30 million and $40 million](https://www.tubefilter.com/2020/09/14/logan-paul-maverick-merch-30-40-million/) in 2020. 

His brother, Jake Paul, is also involved in various ventures, including co-founding [the Anti Fund,](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/jake-paul-looks-to-knock-out-the-venture-capital-world-with-anti-fund/) which has touted past investments in OpenAI, Anduril, Ramp, and Cognition, among others. The younger Paul also owns a grooming line, called W, and a [mobile betting platform](https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/01/betr-sports-betting/) called Betr.

## Ryan’s World

[Ryan’s World](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChGJGhZ9SOOHvBB0Y4DOO_w), hosted by 13-year-old Ryan Kaji, is another prominent YouTuber with a staggering following. Ryan rose to fame through his toy reviews and unboxing videos, which have captivated nearly 40 million young viewers. 

In addition to his YouTube success, Kaji has expanded his brand through a line of toys and apparel that are sold in major retail chains and that reportedly generated [over $250 million](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/how-youtube-channel-ryan-s-world-makes-most-of-its-revenue-merchandise-not-ads) in revenue in 2020. Kaji and his family have since diversified their ventures, including launching a TV show and an app that provides educational content tailored for children.

Huda Kattan founded the globally recognized beauty brand Huda Beauty in 2013. She sold a minority stake to private equity firm TSG Consumer Partners in 2017 but bought it back in June after investor pressure to bring in senior leadership clashed with her vision for the fast-moving brand, which reportedly brings in [hundreds of millions of dollars](https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/beauty/beautys-most-sought-after-ma-targets-in-2024/) in sales each year.

Many influencers have created their own makeup brands. Other well-known makeup brands launched by YouTube influencers include Jeffree Star Cosmetics and Tati Beauty.
