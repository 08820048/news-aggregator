Right now, Costco members can buy five location trackers for $99.99 ($29 off) either online or in-store, bringing the price of each tracker down to about $20 a pop. If you don’t already belong to Costco, you can still take advantage of the discount if you’re willing to pay a $5 surcharge or sign up for an annual membership, which currently starts at $65 a year. Apple AirTag (second-gen) Where to Buy: $145 $99.99 at Costco (five-pack) Apple’s original AirTag has been our favorite tracker for iPhone users for years, and the newest version builds upon that excellence with some welcome improvements. What has always set the AirTag apart is Apple’s ultra wideband chip, which allows for an impressive level of precision that competing products like the Tile Pro can’t match. The company’s new, upgraded chip still guides you straight to misplaced items with on-screen arrows, vibrations, and sounds, but now from up to 50 percent farther away.

The built-in speaker is also 50 percent louder, making it easier to locate the item trackers when they’re hidden from view. The new model also keeps everything we loved in the original AirTag. It still uses a user-replaceable battery, so you don’t need to replace it when it inevitably dies after a year or so. You also get the same IP67 water and dust resistance, extended Bluetooth range, and handy software features that let you share your tracker with up to five people or temporarily share its location with airlines, such as United, Delta, and American Airlines.
