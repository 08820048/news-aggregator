Startup founders are being pushed to move faster than ever, using AI while facing tighter funding, rising infrastructure costs, and more pressure to show real traction early. Cloud credits, access to GPUs, and foundation models have made it easier to get started, but those early infrastructure choices can have unforeseen consequences once startups move beyond free credits and into real cloud bills. 

On this episode of TechCrunch’s [Equity](https://techcrunch.com/podcasts/equity/) podcast, Rebecca Bellan caught up with [Darren Mowry](https://www.capitalg.com/team/darren-mowry/), Google Cloud’s vice president of global startups who is right at the center of those tradeoffs. Watch as they discuss what Mowry’s seeing across the startup ecosystem, how Google Cloud is competing for AI startups, and what founders should be thinking about as they scale.
