Elon Musk’s X is making it easier for advertisers to bring their creative campaigns from other social sites to its platform.

On Thursday, the company launched an expanded set of aspect ratio support for both image and video ads, which means advertisers can now reuse the material they’ve created for other platforms without having to reformat, crop, or rebuild their assets.

While AI has been helping advertisers automate the process of resizing creative assets for different platforms, it’s easier if advertisers don’t have to take that extra step at all.

So X is now allowing advertisers to upload the same assets they’re using elsewhere on social media to its own X Ads Manager via Media Studio or its Campaign Form.

The change signals the continued importance of X’s ad business, which suffered declines after the company, then known as Twitter, was acquired by Musk. While [ad sales improved](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/xs-ad-business-improved-under-departing-ceo-linda-yaccarino-but-its-still-tough-times-ahead/) under former CEO Linda Yaccarino, its 2025 revenues [were still lower](https://www.emarketer.com/content/x-ad-revenue-forecast-2025) than they were prior to Musk’s acquisition.

According to [eMarketer’s](https://www.emarketer.com/content/x-ad-revenue-forecast-2025) forecast last May, X’s ad business was expected to start revitalizing sometime last year, which [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-12/musk-s-x-posts-higher-sales-amid-costly-turnaround) confirmed, but would remain half the size it was before the sale.

X says the new aspect ratios now being supported include 4:5 (1440 x 1800 pixels) and 2:3 (1080 × 1620 pixels). The company already supports other formats, including 1:1 (1080 × 1080 pixels), 16:9 (1920 × 1080 pixels), 9:16 (1080 × 1920 pixels), and 1.91:1 (2064 × 1080 pixels).

“We’re committed to empowering advertisers to hit their performance goals with greater ease and impact,” said Monique Pintarelli, head of global advertising at xAI, in a statement. (xAI [acquired](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/29/elon-musk-says-xai-acquired-x/) X last year.)

“With full aspect ratio support, brands can now repurpose creatives directly on X—eliminating reformatting, duplication, or compromise—while unlocking faster testing, brand consistency, and incremental reach among our highly engaged, real-time audience for superior results,” she added.
