Lego’s new Smart Brick is a [pretty big deal](https://www.theverge.com/tech/854556/lego-announces-smart-brick-the-most-significant-evolution-in-50-years). It packs a miniature computer, a microphone, and NFC tech into a classic 2x4 Lego brick, which can power all sorts of new experiences with select sets. It has so much promise that we awarded it “[best in show](https://www.theverge.com/tech/858494/ces-2026-best-new-tech-tv-car-wearable#best-in-show)” at CES 2026, and now, eight _Star Wars_\-themed sets that support the Smart Brick (and include it, in some cases) are now available.

Three of them include at least one Smart Brick, along with a charging cradle and cable, while the rest are merely “Smart Play compatible,” meaning they’re BYOB (bring your own brick). The interactivity of the NFC tags and the smart minifigurs won’t be possible unless you already own one of Lego’s fancy, computerized bricks. The cheapest set to include a Smart Brick is Darth Vader’s TIE Fighter, which costs $69.99 at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Star-Wars-Smart-Play/dp/B0FMYWXY7S/?tag=theverge02-20), [Best Buy](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Flego-star-wars-smart-play-darth-vaders-tie-fighter-75421%2FJXPLL2HV4X), and [Lego’s online storefront](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=13923&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fsmart-play-darth-vaders-tie-fighter-75421), while the priciest one — the Throne Room Duel & A-Wing set — is available from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Star-Wars-Smart-Wing/dp/B0FMYVF9NB/?tag=theverge02-20), [Best Buy](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Flego-star-wars-smart-play-throne-room-duel-a-wing-75427%2FJXPLL2HVFQ), and [Lego](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=13923&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fsmart-play-throne-room-duel-a-wing-75427) for $159.99 with two Smart Bricks.
