Lenovo’s next gaming laptop could be a shapeshifting foldable called the Legion Go Fold, which can be used as a laptop or a handheld gaming PC with two different display sizes, as [_WindowsLatest_](https://www.windowslatest.com/2026/02/26/exclusive-lenovo-legion-go-foldable-is-an-11-6-handheld-that-doubles-as-a-pc/) reports. Leaked images of the device show it attached to both a keyboard and controllers, with a hinge in the middle of the POLED display, allowing it to unfold from 7.7 inches to 11.6 inches.

Users can attach the controllers with the display folded or unfolded, use the display in a vertical split screen mode, or attach it to the keyboard for laptop mode, for a total of four different form factors rolled into one device. Even the controllers are convertible: the right side controller can be used as a vertical mouse in “FPS Mode,” similar to the mouse mode on [the Legion Go 2](https://www.theverge.com/news/769776/legion-go-2-official-lenovo-new-flagship-handheld-cost) or the [Nintendo Switch 2](https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review). The right-side controller also has a built-in display that shows performance metrics and settings and doubles as a touchpad.

The Legion Go Fold is rumored to include an Intel Core Ultra 7 258V CPU, 32GB of RAM, and a 48 Whr battery. According to _WindowsLatest_, Lenovo plans to announce it as a concept device at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona next week, although it likely wouldn’t be commercially available right away, if ever.
