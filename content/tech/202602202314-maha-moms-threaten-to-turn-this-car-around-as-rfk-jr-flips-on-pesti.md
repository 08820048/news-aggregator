“We must safeguard America’s national security first, because all of our priorities depend on it. When hostile actors control critical inputs, they weaken our security. By expanding domestic production, we close that gap and protect American families,” he said.

## Fallout

Dave Murphy, founder and CEO of United We Eat and former finance manager on Kennedy’s presidential campaign, told Reuters that the order was a “strategic mistake” that could serve as an election liability. “Trump would not be in the White House this second time without those followers, and we expect him to live up to his word,” Murphy said.

Fallout has continued online over the move, and MAHA organizers are scrambling.

Alex Clark, a health and wellness podcaster for the conservative group Turning Point USA, [told The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/19/us/politics/maha-moms-glyphosate-roundup-robert-kennedy.html) that “Women feel like they were lied to, that MAHA movement is a sham,” he said. “How am I supposed to rally these women to vote red in the midterms? How can we win their trust back? I am unsure if we can.”

Meanwhile, MAHA influencer Kelly Ryerson, who goes by the moniker “Glyphosate Girl” online, [told Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/20/maha-unleashes-on-white-house-after-trump-backs-pesticide-00790187), “I’m witnessing the bottom falling out on MAHA. People came along on MAHA because of pesticides and foods. It wasn’t because of vaccines.”

Zen Honeycutt, executive director of the grassroots group Moms Across America, told Politico in a statement that the fallout will have real consequences.

“To put toxic farming and businesses before the health and safety of our children is a betrayal of every voter who voted for him to \[Make America Healthy Again\],” she said. “The repercussions are not going to just affect the midterms, but the health of millions of Americans for generations to come.”
