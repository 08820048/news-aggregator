To close out its February 2026 State of Play presentation, Sony revealed _God of War Sons of Sparta_, a new prequel 2D side scroller in the _God of War_ franchise, and announced that it’s [out right now](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA28997_00-SONSOFSPARTAPS50) on PlayStation 5.

”_God of War Sons of Sparta_ is a 2D action platformer with a canon story set in Kratos’ youth during his harsh training at the Agoge alongside his brother Deimos,” [Sony says](https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/god-of-war-greek-trilogy-remake-in-development-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-out-now/). Over the course of the game, Kratos will “learn deadly skills using his spear and shield, as well as harness powerful divine artifacts known as the Gifts of Olympus to take on a wide array of foes.”

Sony’s Santa Monica Studio collaborated on the game with [Mega Cat Studios](https://megacatstudios.com/?srsltid=AfmBOorSQLZyJTP_WL6SMIKok01L0dY35LHwwUBHRTwqZ4AetCFAMWTu). It costs $29.99, with a Digital Deluxe version available for $39.99.

Sony also announced that it’s working on a [remake of the original _God of War_ trilogy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_tq12WisX8), with TC Carson set to return as the voice of Kratos. However, the project is “still very early in development, so we ask for your patience as it will be a while before anything else can be shared,” according to Sony. “When we can come back with an update, we aim to make it a big one!”
