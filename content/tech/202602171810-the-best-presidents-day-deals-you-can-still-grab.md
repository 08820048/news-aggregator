summary: "The Sonos Era 100, one of our go-to smart speakers, is still on sale in white for $179. | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge Deals have been pretty scarce since the holidays, but now that February is in full swing, we’ve seen strong discounts return across a range of categories. Both Valentine’s Day and Presidents Day brought a deluge of discounts, and although both have passed, a number of notable deals remain. In fact, you can still save on everything from Sonos speakers and OLED TVs to earbuds, fitness trackers, and other gadgets. Below, we’ve rounded up the best Presidents Day deals still available, the bulk of which we anticipate expiring by the end of the week. Headphone and earbud deals Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 Significantly smaller and lighter than their predecessors, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 also offer stronger noise cancellation, a crystal clear transparency mode, and lengthy battery life. Read our review. Where to Buy: $229 $179 at Amazon $229 $179 at Walmart You can currently buy the Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus at Best Buy for $149.99 ($50 off), which is just $10 more than their all-time low. The open-style earbuds boast wireless charging and support for Dolby Audio, but are otherwise nearly identical to the Shokz OpenFit 2, with one dedicated bass speaker and another for mids and highs. They don’t sound as clear as the OpenRun Pro 2, but they do sound better than the OpenFit Air and offer helpful onboard touch controls. The latest pair of AirPods Max are on sale at Amazon and Walmart for $449 ($100 off), which is $50 shy of their best price to date. Apple’s stainless steel / aluminum headphones offer a high-end look few headphones can match, along with a natural-sounding transparency mode and some of the best noise cancellation available. They also play well with other Apple devices, providing Apple users access to automatic device switching, head-tracking spatial audio, built-in Find My support, and other notable features. Read our original review. The Sonos Ace are currently available from Amazon and Best Buy for $319 ($80 off), which is the best price we’ve seen since they dropped to $249 in December. Sonos’ first pair of headphones deliver great ANC and sound, but what really makes them stand out is that you can easily swap TV audio from a compatible Sonos soundbar to your headphones for private listening. Read our review. Nothing Headphone 1 Nothing’s first pair of over-ear headphones feature a retro transparent design and high-end features like active noise cancellation, spatial audio with head tracking, and plush ear pads. They also feature a paddle button that allows you to control music playback. Read our review. Where to Buy: $299 $239 at Amazon Speaker deals Sonos Era 100 Sonos’ Era 100 smart speaker is a replacement for the older Sonos One, utilizing two tweeters (left and right) and one larger woofer. In addition to Wi-Fi, the Era 100 also supports Bluetooth audio and line-in playback via an optional 3.5mm to USB-C adapter. Where to Buy: $219 $179 at Amazon The Sonos Era 300 is also on sale for $379.99 ($100 off) at Amazon, which is $20 shy of its best price to date. The fantastic smart speaker delivers more powerful, Dolby Atmos-enabled sound than the Era 100, allowing for room-filling spatial audio. It also supports Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and line-in audio via USB-C (with Sonos’ optional adapter), as well as voice controls via Amazon Alexa. Read our review. JBL Authentics 200 The JBL Authentics 200 is one of the first smart speakers with simultaneous Google Assistant and Alexa support. The small, ‘70s-style speaker produces great sound for its size, and you don’t need to toggle a setting to use your preferred virtual assistant. Where to Buy: $349.95 $199.95 at Amazon $349.99 $199.95 at Best Buy You can buy the JBL Charge 6 at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart for $159.95 ($40 off), which is $10 shy of its lowest price to date. The rugged Bluetooth speaker builds on its predecessor with improved sound, a more robust IP68 water resistance rating, and up to 28 hours of continuous playback on a single charge. It also supports lossless audio with compatible services like Spotify, and features a removable strap so you can carry it around easily. As an added bonus, it even doubles as a power bank. The tiny JBL Clip 5 is available from Amazon, Best Buy, and JBL for $59.95 ($20 off), which is $10 more than its best-ever price. The Clip 5 offers up to 12 hours of battery life on a single charge while delivering surprisingly powerful sound for its size, which you can adjust using JBL’s companion app. It also features an IP67 rating and a built-in carabiner, so you can clip it to your bag, handlebars, or anything else you can latch it to. TV and streaming deals Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus The latest version of Amazon’s zippy Fire TV Stick 4K streams in 4K resolution, as its name suggests, and features support for Wi-Fi 6, Dolby Atmos / Vision, and HDR10 Plus. Where to Buy: $49.99 $29.99 at Target $49.99 $29.99 at Amazon $49.99 $29.99 at Best Buy LG B5 OLED TV LG’s budget B5 is a great way to get OLED picture quality for less. It features support for both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, along with a 120Hz panel and four HDMI 2.1 ports for hooking up the latest gaming consoles.

It has a good amount of brightness, excellent color accuracy out of the box, and great gaming features, including a max 144Hz refresh rate. Where to Buy: $1999.99 $1046.99 at Best Buy (55-inch) $1999.99 $1046.99 at Amazon (55-inch) $1999.99 $1199.99 at LG (55-inch) LG’s high-end G5 OLED TV is on sale in the 83-inch configuration for about $5,296.99 ($1,200 off) at Amazon and LG’s online storefront (where you’ll also receive $200 off one of several soundbars). LG’s step-up OLED offers all the features of the midrange C5, but it’s noticeably brighter, with a higher maximum refresh rate of 165Hz. It also features a more powerful chip, enabling better image processing and upscaling, so lower-res content looks sharper and more detailed. Sony Bravia 8 II OLED TV The Bravia 8 II was chosen as the “king of TV” by a panel of judges (including The Verge’s own Nilay Patel) in Value Electronics’ 2025 shootout. The OLED TV has excellent color accuracy, a bright panel, and a 120Hz refresh rate.

Read our review. Where to Buy: $429 $329 at Amazon (46mm) $399 $299 at Walmart (42mm) Amazfit Active 2 The Amazfit Active 2 delivers outsized value for the price. It looks spiffy and has a wide array of health tracking features, plus built-in GPS and AI chatbots to provide extra context to your data. Read our review. Where to Buy: $99.99 $79.99 at Amazon You can buy the Fitbit Charge 6 starting at $129.95 ($30 off) at Amazon. The Charge 6 is our favorite Fitbit, one that combines several notable health features — including an FDA-cleared EKG reader and blood oxygen sensors — with built-in GPS and an NFC chip so you can use Google Wallet. You can also pair it with select gym equipment via Bluetooth and get turn-by-turn directions via Google Maps. Read our review. Fitbit Ace LTE The Ace LTE sports some of the same hardware found on the Google Pixel Watch 2 and a variety of step-activated games, which can help motivate your child to keep moving. It also offers calling, messaging, and location sharing when you sign up for a monthly or annual data plan. Where to Buy: $179.99 $99.95 at Amazon $179.99 $159 at Best Buy Apple Watch Ultra 2 The rugged Apple Watch Ultra 2 comes in one size: 49mm.

Read our review. Where to Buy: $799 $549 at Best Buy (with Ocean Band) $799 $549 at Best Buy (with Alpine Loop) $799 $549 at Best Buy (with Trail Loop) Smart home deals Echo Dot Max The Echo Dot Max features a flat design and a redesigned sound system, which delivers nearly three times the bass as its predecessor. It also offers improved conversation detection and better noise filtering, thanks to Amazon’s new AZ3 chip. Read our review. Where to Buy: $99.99 $79.99 at Amazon $99.99 $79.99 at Best Buy $99.99 $79.99 at Target Aura Aspen The Aura Aspen digital frame lets you upload photos from anywhere using an accompanying companion app, various cloud services, or email. Its 12-inch LCD display features slim bezels, a 4:3 aspect ratio, and an anti-glare screen designed to mimic the look of real photos. Where to Buy: $229 $199 at Amazon $229 $199 at Aura $229.99 $199.99 at Best Buy You can grab a refurbished Eufy X10 Pro Omni from Anker (via eBay) with a two-year warranty for $279.99 (which is $620 less than buying it new) when you use coupon code ANKERSPRING26. The X10 Pro Omni is a powerful robot vacuum / mop hybrid, with dual oscillating brushes and 8,000Pa of suction. Its all-in-one dock can automatically empty the dustbin, refill the water tank, and dry the mop pads, while the onboard water reservoir lets it clean for longer stretches before needing to dock. Amazon Echo Show 15 The Echo Show 15 is a large wall-mounted device that acts as a shared hub for families to view upcoming calendar appointments, virtual notes, and more. The 15.6-inch device also features the same Alexa functionality as other Echo displays and smart speakers. Read our review. Where to Buy: $299.99 $254.99 at Amazon $299.99 $254.99 at Best Buy If you don’t need a robot vacuum that can sweep your baseboards or empty its own bin, the Eufy 11S Max is on sale at Amazon and Walmart for $139.99 ($140 off), which is one of its better prices to date. The entry-level robovac isn’t the smartest option available, but it’s at least aware enough not to bump into walls or tumble down stairs. The 11S Max offers good carpet and hard surface cleaning with relative quietness, too, and its 600ml bin is roomy enough to go through several cleanings before it needs to be dumped. Gaming deals Battlefield 6 Battlefield 6 is the best-selling title in the franchise’s history. The military first-person shooter puts a bigger focus on environmental destruction than previous entries, adding a level of chaos that helps make its large-scale, multiplayer battles feel more engaging.

Set in feudal Japan, the open-world third-person action game follows two protagonists — a shinobi assassin and a powerful samurai — as they navigate political unrest and power struggles. It’s a challenging, thoughtful game that offers a good balance of action and stealth. Read our review. Amazon is selling a physical copy of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X for an all-time low of $34.99 ($25 off). The remake updates the original 1988 turn-based RPG with HD-2D visuals, modern gameplay improvements, and small yet helpful tweaks, including clearer maps. The welcome quality-of-life upgrades, as well as the additional story elements, make it a great entry point for newcomers, even though it’s technically the third game in the series. Read our review. The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening brings back the classic adventure from the original GameBoy to experience on the Nintendo Switch with an extremely cute art style. Read our review. Where to Buy: $59.99 $39.88 at Walmart Borderlands 4 Borderlands 4 is an amusing looter-shooter that supports solo play or up to four-player co-op. Players take on the role of one of four Vault Hunters searching for mythical vaults while trying to take on the planet’s immoral dictator. It’s full of great characters and has the mindlessly fun vibe of a dumb action movie. Read our review. Where to Buy: $69.99 $44.99 at Best Buy (PlayStation 5) $69.99 $44.99 at Amazon (PlayStation 5) $69.99 $41.99 at Amazon (Xbox Series X / S) Other great deals Anker Nano Charger (45W, Smart Display, 180° Foldable) Anker’s latest single-port USB-C charger offers up to 45W of power, foldable prongs, and a front-facing “smart display” that lets you see the charge level, power flow, and other useful information at a glance. Where to Buy: $39.99 $29.99 at Anker (with code WSPDV2QRVDN7) $39.99 $29.99 at Amazon (with Prime) The Dyson Airwrap i.d. is available for $499.99 ($150 off) from Best Buy and Dyson. Dyson’s first smart hair styler can automatically adjust heat, timing, and airflow based on your hair profile, letting you dry, curl, wave, smooth, volumize, or manage flyaways much more easily. The special edition — which is what’s on sale here — also includes a presentation case and a detangling comb. Apple AirTag (first-gen) Apple’s first-gen AirTags can help you find your lost items with their UWB technology. You’ll get the best compatibility with an iPhone, though Apple released an Android app to detect an AirTag’s location if one seems to be following you. Read our original review. Where to Buy: $29 $17 at Walmart $99 $64 at Amazon (four-pack) $99 $64 at Walmart (four-pack) You can buy the DJI Osmo Mobile 7P for around $99 ($20 off), its lowest price to date, at Amazon and Best Buy. The three-axis smartphone gimbal physically stabilizes your phone, so you can take clearer selfies and videos. It also comes with a built-in tripod, a telescoping extension arm, and a built-in camera that automatically follows you, starts and stops recordings, and adjusts the framing when you perform a hand gesture. The Nespresso VertuoPlus, a Verge favorite, is currently on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for $101.39 (about $68 off), which is easily the best price we’ve seen this year. It’s a shame that the versatile espresso machine relies on Vertuo pods rather than Nespresso’s cheaper options, though we do admire its one-button operation and the fact that it can also brew an 8-ounce cup of coffee when needed. Coway Airmega AP-1512HH Mighty air purifier Coway’s surprisingly efficient Airmega AP-1512HH Mighty is compact enough to fit in any corner of your home and offers a three-stage filtration system, including a true HEPA filter. Where to Buy: $239.99 $154.99 at Amazon (white) $239.99 $154.99 at Amazon (black) $239.99 $154.99 at Coway Update, February 17th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and remove several expired deals."
