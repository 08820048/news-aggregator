Social community platform Discord is preparing to require users to verify their age by the [second half of 2026](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/24/discord-delays-global-rollout-of-age-verification-after-backlash/), and users are concerned about the privacy of [uploading a government ID or face scan](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/09/discord-to-roll-out-age-verification-next-month-for-full-access-to-its-platform/) to the network. While users can still access most features without verification, many remain uneasy giving more information to a company that suffered a [breach](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/discord-suffers-data-breach-impacting-at-least-70000-users/) last year that exposed the IDs of around 70,000 users. 

For some users, this is motivation enough to seek out alternative platforms that prioritize security, privacy, or simply offer a different experience. Here’s a look at the most promising Discord alternatives, from open-source and secure options to voice-first platforms built for hardcore gamers. 

## Stoat

[Stoat](https://stoat.chat/) (formerly Revolt) stands out as the closest Discord alternative in both design and usability. As an open-source project, it gives users more control over their data and appeals to those who value privacy and transparency. Overall, the platform is fairly easy for Discord users to pick up, offering similar text and voice channels as well as community servers. 

However, Stoat is a relatively new platform (launched in 2021), and still faces growing pains. Recently, it experienced [server capacity issues](https://status.stoat.chat/) and the occasional lag during user surges. Feature support isn’t yet on par with Discord’s, and onboarding can be slow at times, especially when the platform’s popularity spikes. For those willing to trade a bit of stability for increased privacy, though, Stoat could be worth a try.

## Element

For users who prioritize privacy and control above all else, [Element](https://element.io/en) offers a compelling alternative. Built on the decentralized Matrix protocol, Element enables users to self-host servers, maintain end-to-end encryption, and federate with other Matrix-based services. This ensures that no single company controls your data. 

While the setup and interface require a bit more technical savvy than Discord’s, Element is a good choice for users who value secure, decentralized communication.

## TeamSpeak

If your primary need is high-quality, low-latency voice chat, [TeamSpeak](https://www.teamspeak.com/en/) is the best alternative to Discord. While it remains popular among competitive gamers for its superior audio and private server hosting, its text chat and media sharing are quite basic. It’s also missing built-in video calls as well as emojis and gifs. So if you don’t mind not having as many features, it’s great for voice-centric groups that don’t need all the bells and whistles.

Similar to Stoat, TeamSpeak has experienced a [surge in new users](https://x.com/teamspeak/status/2023443122676502941?s=20), prompting the platform to expand its hosting capacity. In February, TeamSpeak introduced two new regions for community creation: “Frankfurt 3” and “Toronto 1.”

## Mumble

[Mumble](https://www.mumble.info/downloads/) is a free, open-source voice chat application. Like TeamSpeak, it provides high-quality, low-latency audio and allows users to host and customize their own servers. However, its interface is outdated and lacks some of the features found in Discord, making it more ideal for hardcore gamers focused on voice chat rather than community building through video calls, media sharing, or screen sharing.

## Discourse

Those who prefer long-form, organized discussions over rapid-fire chat may find [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) more appealing. As an open-source forum platform, Discourse supports threaded discussions, making it ideal for educational groups, professional teams, and communities that value in-depth conversation. However, users looking for instant messaging, voice, and casual group chats may find it less familiar than Discord.

## Slack, Microsoft Teams, Signal, or WhatsApp

Other notable mentions include Slack and Microsoft Teams, which serve well for professional and productivity-focused communication. [Signal](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/signal-gets-new-video-call-features-making-it-a-viable-alternative-to-zoom-meet-and-teams/) is also a top choice for those who want end-to-end [encryption and privacy](https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/25/cybersecurity-101-guide-encrypted-messaging-apps/). Meanwhile, WhatsApp also offers free messaging and group voice calls, though it’s not designed for gaming or large communities.

## What to know about age verification on Discord 

Discord recently announced that it will soon implement age verification measures aimed at creating a safer environment, particularly for its younger users. This initiative is designed to ensure users meet the necessary age requirements to access certain features and communities on the platform. Users may be required to verify their age through various methods, which could involve submitting an ID, completing a facial age estimation, or using a credit card. 

By default, all users will experience a “teen-appropriate” setting, and only those verified as adults will have the ability to modify certain settings or access age-restricted content. Adults will be required to verify their status to unblur sensitive content and to access channels and servers designated for an older audience. 

After recent backlash, Discord [postponed the official launch](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/24/discord-delays-global-rollout-of-age-verification-after-backlash/) to the latter half of 2026, adding that 90% of users will not require age verification and can continue using the platform without changes, as many users do not engage with age-restricted content. The platform initially planned to roll out age verification in March.
