summary: "As promised, Google opened preorders for its Pixel 10A midrange phone, and it’ll launch on March 4th. We already published a hands-on with the device, and I encourage you to check it out (we think it’s more like a better Pixel 9A than a slightly worse Pixel 10). If you decide that you want to go through with a preorder, the best deal we’ve found so far is at Amazon and Best Buy, where you can get a $100 gift card by preordering the $499 phone with 128GB of storage in any of its four colors (berry, fog, obsidian, lavender). Alternatively, you can opt to get a free pair of Pixel Buds 2A (a $129 value) instead with the purchase of the obsidian color at Amazon. Google Pixel 10A Where to Buy: $599 $499 at Amazon (free $100 gift card) $629 $499 at Amazon (free Pixel Buds 2A) $599 $499 at Best Buy (free $100 gift card) If you want to buy a Pixel 10A through the Google Store, it’s offering either a $100 store credit or a pair of Pixel Buds 2A with purchase through March 11th. Additionally, trading in your phone can knock down the price of the 10A to as low as $49, depending on the model (my Pixel 9 Pro with 128GB of storage would get $450 in trade-in credit, and the iPhone 16 Pro Max would only get $100 more). While the Pixel 10A looks almost identical to last year’s Pixel 9A, there are some differences. It has the stronger Gorilla Glass 7i glass, and it’s capable of going up to 11 percent brighter, peaking at 3,000 nits. Google says that the screen’s bezels are 10 percent narrower. It’s a similar phone to the Pixel 9A internally, too, with the Tensor G4 processor and 8GB of RAM, but it lacks PixelSnap, so it can’t tap into Google’s ecosystem of magnetic Pixel 10 accessories. It has some AI-powered features from the latest flagship phone, but ones like Magic Cue and Pixel Screenshots aren’t included here due to memory constraints. We’ll be keeping an eye out for other appealing Pixel 10A preorder offers to add to this post ahead of the phone’s launch."
