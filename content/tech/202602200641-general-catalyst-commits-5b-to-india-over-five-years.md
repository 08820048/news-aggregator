General Catalyst, a Silicon Valley-based venture firm with more than $43 billion in assets under management, has announced it plans to invest $5 billion in India over the next five years, sharply expanding its push into the country’s startup ecosystem less than two years after [merging with local venture firm Venture Highway](https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/19/general-catalyst-india-venture-highway/).

The commitment, unveiled at the [India AI Impact Summit](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/16/all-the-important-news-from-the-ongoing-india-ai-summit/) in New Delhi on Friday, will target startups across artificial intelligence, healthcare, defense technology, fintech, and consumer technology. The announcement marks a significant increase from the $500 million to $1 billion the firm had previously earmarked for India.

India, the world’s most populous country with more than a billion internet users, is positioning itself as a major AI investment destination. New Delhi aims to [attract over $200 billion in AI infrastructure investments](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/india-bids-to-attract-over-200b-in-ai-infrastructure-investment-by-2028/) over the next two years as it hosts the India AI Impact Summit with participation from companies, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.

“India will build the next generation of global platform companies,” General Catalyst CEO Hemant Taneja (pictured above) said, adding that the firm sees Indian founders as uniquely positioned to develop technology for markets serving enormous populations.

General Catalyst said it sees India’s biggest AI opportunity in large-scale real-world deployment rather than in building so-called frontier models. The firm cited the country’s government-built digital infrastructure, vast domestic market, and deep services talent pool as reasons for that view.

The push comes as India’s AI ambitions accelerate. At the summit, conglomerates [Adani Group](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/adani-pledges-100b-for-ai-data-centers-as-india-seeks-bigger-role-in-global-ai/) and [Reliance Industries](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/19/reliance-unveils-110b-ai-investment-plan-as-india-ramps-up-tech-ambitions/), led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, announced plans to invest more than $200 billion combined to build AI data center infrastructure in the country. [OpenAI has separately partnered with Tata Group’s TCS](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/18/openai-taps-tata-for-100mw-ai-data-center-capacity-in-india-eyes-1gw/) — one of India’s largest tech companies — to develop a 100-megawatt AI data center as part of the expansion of its Stargate infrastructure project. In recent months, global tech companies including [Amazon](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/amazon-to-invest-additional-35b-in-india-by-2030-taking-total-planned-spending-to-75b/), [Google](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/google-to-invest-15b-in-indian-ai-infrastructure-hub/), and [Microsoft](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/microsoft-to-invest-17-5b-in-india-by-2029-as-ai-race-accelerates/) have also outlined tens of billions of dollars in cloud and AI investments in the country.

General Catalyst has been building its India portfolio across fast delivery e-commerce, health tech, and deep tech, with investments including Zepto, PB Health, Raphe, Jeh Aerospace, Pronto, and Ayr Energy.

“This investment allows us to operate at a different scale in India,” Neeraj Arora, General Catalyst’s CEO for India, the Middle East, and North Africa, said, adding that the firm aims to support companies from early stage through to the public markets.

General Catalyst said it is developing a framework to accelerate large-scale AI adoption across priority sectors in India, aiming to help convert pilot projects into full deployments. The firm’s General Catalyst Institute has also been working to build government-industry partnerships in the country.
