Apple has [invited the tech press](https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/apple-announces-special-event-in-new-york/) to a “special Apple experience” on March 4, but it might unfold a bit differently than the company’s standard press event.

Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reports that instead of announcing everything at a single keynote, [Apple is planning a “three-day flurry of announcements”](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-22/apple-s-ai-wearables-push-what-to-expect-from-march-4-low-end-macbook-launch) — presumably announced online, and culminating in the March 4 “experience” that will consist of be three events in New York, London, and Shanghai, where the press will be offered a chance to get hands-on with the upcoming products.

Similarly, Daring Fireball’s John Gruber speculated that the experience could be [“a hands-on thing with in-person demos.”](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/17/apple-special-experience-march-4)

Apple will reportedly be announcing at least five new products during that time, including a low-cost MacBook. Other reported possibilities: the iPhone 17e, an iPad Air with an M4 chip, a new entry-level iPad, and an upgraded MacBook Air and new MacBook Pro models. Gurman said all of those products are due this spring, but he sounded less certain about which ones will be announced when.
