Apple and Netflix have [entered a partnership](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/formula-1-apple-netflix-drive-to-survive) to co-broadcast the Formula 1 Canadian Grand Prix, announced Thursday by Apple’s senior vice president of services, Eddy Cue. For the first time, F1 fans in the U.S. will be able to watch the live race simultaneously on both Apple TV and Netflix. 

Netflix subscribers will be able to stream the full race weekend — including practice, qualifying, and the Grand Prix itself on May 24 — live on the platform.

​Beyond live race coverage, the partnership includes cross-promotion of Netflix’s hit series, “Drive to Survive.” For the first time, the eighth season — which consists of eight episodes covering the 2025 Formula One World Championship — will be available to both Apple TV subscribers in the U.S. and Netflix users globally, significantly broadening its audience. 

Season 8 premieres today, on February 27. 

F1’s rise in American culture extends beyond television at this point — Brad Pitt’s “F1” is nominated for Best Picture at this year’s Academy Awards. “Drive to Survive” has successfully [attracted a diverse audience](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/4402239/2023/04/13/f1-formula-one-drive-to-survive-ratings/) for its behind-the-scenes approach, transforming it from a typical sports docuseries into a compelling narrative that’s brought in millions of new fans.

The series has been a particular focus of Apple’s broader F1 ambitions: The company has said it plans to promote the sport across Apple News, Apple Maps (highlighting F1 tracks around the world), Apple Music, and Apple Fitness+, as well as in its physical retail stores.

This collaboration also means Netflix continues to push into live sports broadcasting, after pivoting from a [“no-sports” stance](https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/25/netflix-is-not-yet-considering-live-sports-but-heres-why-it-should/) to securing major rights for [NFL Christmas games](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/14/netflix-adds-more-live-tv-to-its-lineup/), [WWE Raw](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/wwe-raw-netflix-release-date-news), and [MLB](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/mlb-netflix-opening-day-home-run-derby-field-of-dreams).

Additionally, the joint effort comes as part of Apple’s new [multi-year deal](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/17/apple-and-formula-1-ink-five-year-us-streaming-deal-bringing-all-races-to-apple-tv/) with Formula 1, under which Apple TV replaced ESPN as the exclusive U.S. broadcaster for all 24 races beginning this season. The deal is reportedly valued at around $150 million per season, a significant jump from the roughly [$85 million](https://www.planetf1.com/news/f1-2025-revenue-record-3-billion) ESPN reportedly paid. All races are available to Apple TV subscribers at no extra charge. The previous partnership with ESPN achieved an average viewership of [1.3 million](https://espnpressroom.com/us/press-releases/2025/12/espn-finishes-final-formula-1-season-with-all-time-viewership-record/) in its final year.

Notably, [Netflix](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/07/netflix-espn-and-nbcuniversal-compete-for-u-s-formula-1-rights-report-says/) was previously reported to be eyeing U.S. media rights for Formula 1 back in 2022.
