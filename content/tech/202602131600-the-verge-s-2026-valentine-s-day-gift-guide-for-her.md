Valentine’s Day often comes with more pressure than it needs to. At heart, though, February 14th is about showing appreciation for the people you care about in ways that feel thoughtful and sincere. And while big displays of romance can do that, it’s often the quieter, more personal gestures — or a meaningful gift that makes life just a little more enjoyable — that matter most.

Below, we’ve rounded up gift ideas that, in our experience, do just that. Some are practical picks, like a pair of [noise-canceling earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Headphones-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0DGJ7HYG1?tag=theverge02-20) meant to help you focus or a pair of [USB-C hand warmers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CC18WMZS/?tag=theverge02-20) for those cold, blustery days back east. Others, such as [Renpho’s eye massager](https://www.amazon.com/RENPHO-Massager-Compression-Bluetooth-Rechargeable/dp/B07SM61FCT?tag=theverge02-20), are designed for rest and relaxation, while some of [our more sentimental picks](https://www.amazon.com/WERE-NOT-REALLY-STRANGERS-Strangers/dp/B0B7V56B7H?tag=theverge02-20) aspire to create a deeper, more lasting kind of romance.

Whether you’re shopping for your wife, a close friend, a partner, or a girlfriend, these gifts are meant to make that special someone in your life feel seen, cared for, and appreciated — regardless of the day.

How much do you want to spend?

The Stranger Things Hellfire Club Personalized Raglan Shirt is a fun, throwback-style gift for fans of the hit Netflix show.

Jewelry is a classic V-Day gift, but too often it gets worn once and forgotten. The Oura Ring 4 is different. It both looks great and provides a practical use case, letting you quietly track sleep, activity, and other health metrics (with a subscription). It’s the perfect gift for someone who cares about their health but wants something more discreet — and a little more stylish — than a typical fitness band.

Dyson’s Airwrap i.d. is basically a shortcut to a good hair day. The dryer will automatically adjust the heat, airflow, and timing for your hair based on your app preferences, taking the guesswork out of curling and styling. The special edition kit also includes a presentation case and detangling comb, making it even handier.

If you’re shopping for a known bibliophile who already owns enough books, this roomy tote from the New York Public Library is a good alternative. The durable, 14 x 17–inch bag takes a cue from vintage library cards and is sturdy enough for stowing both hardcover epics and groceries, rendering it a genuinely useful gift that still feels a touch more personal.

Pasta should be a love language by itself — and renowned author/chef Joshua McFadden knows this. His excellent follow-up to _Six Seasons_: _A New Way with Vegetables_ is perfect for those with a soft spot for baked ziti or eggplant puttanesca, especially since the cookbook features more than 125 recipes spanning each of the four seasons.

$200

The Polaroid Flip is great for anyone who loves capturing moments the old-fashioned way. It’s inspired by classic Polaroids and produces photos that look similarly “vintage,” only they’re sharper and more focused. Plus, you get modern add-ons like Bluetooth and a companion app for fine-tuning settings, allowing you to make the most of your time shooting.

Quince’s Organic Turkish Waffle Robe delivers spa-like comfort at a relatively reasonable price, regardless of where you wear it. The soft, ultra-absorbent robe is made of long-staple Turkish cotton and is ideal for slipping on after a shower, yet it’s also lightweight enough to wear around the house while you’re getting ready to start the day.

If gifting actual roses feels a little too cliché, Lego’s version makes for a playful alternative. The aptly titled Lego Roses set is both a gift and a 120-piece activity, which culminates in a pair of adjustable rose blossoms. Once finished, they double as decor, the kind that won’t wither within a week or two.

Breakfast in bed, anyone? Dash’s heart-shaped waffle maker can be used for those lovely syrup-soaked breakfast delights or even some savory hash browns and paninis. If waffle hearts are a bit too lovey-dovey cheesy for you, remember that you can always turn them upside down and use some creative trimming to turn them into something much more… “cheeky.”

If you’re looking for a gift that feels more personal, the Aura Carver might fit the bill. The frame’s 10.1-inch display can showcase photos of you and your partner, from your first date to your anniversary. Images are easy to upload to the cloud using Android or iOS, too, making it simple to revisit old memories or add new ones as they happen.

Azul is a great gift for couples who are looking for a board game they can easily knock out over a cup of coffee. The goal is to accumulate a wealth of points while building an eye-catching mosaic; however, despite the simple premise, there’s a subtle level of depth for those who wish to dig in.

Paper Love’s massive floral card is a great option for those times when a valentine and a pack of Sweet Tarts just won’t cut it. When opened, the pop-up unfolds to reveal a butterfly with flowery accents, which you can leave on full display. The card also includes a small note tag, so you can personalize it with a heartfelt message.

Ocoopa’s UT3 are a thoughtful gift for the valentine who’s always cold. Each USB-C puck can reach up to 126 degrees Fahrenheit and heats up quickly, helping you get warm — and stay warm — for up to eight hours. They’re also thin and light enough that you can easily slip them into a pocket or purse, especially since they snap together via magnets.

The Mini Fleur Frame combines the personal touch of a framed photo with the romance of flowers — minus the whole expiration date thing. At the center is a 2 x 3-inch photo of your choice, flanked by 14 Ecuadorian rose blossoms, each of which should last a year or longer. That makes it far more unique than your standard bouquet or wooden frame.

If you want to score brownie points but spare your hands, the latest Theragun Mini is a no-brainer. The powerful, three-speed massage gun can melt away tension much like Theragun’s beefier models, only it comes in a travel-friendly package that’s far easier to lug around. The assorted attachments and included carrying case just add to the convenience.

A scratch-off Valentine’s Day card is far more creative than your run-of-the-mill valentine from Target. All you have to do is jot down a heartfelt note with a pen or pencil before covering it with the provided sticker, which your giftee can then scratch off to reveal your hidden message. It’s a lot like gifting a lotto ticket, that is, if the odds were always in your favor.

If your valentine has a sweet tooth, the Ninja Creami is the gift that keeps on giving. The versatile machine features seven preset programs, which let you whip up everything from smoothies to high-calorie desserts with the press of a button. It even comes with a 30-recipe starter guide and two 16-ounce pints, so you and your belle can indulge together.

Weighted blankets are calming and great for keeping you warm, but many are too heavy to carry around the house. The Weighted Lap Blanket is a more portable alternative, offering a similar effect in a smaller package that’s closer in size to a throw pillow. It’s ideal for anyone who travels often, works at a desk, or just likes to relax on the couch. Plus, it’s much easier to store, too, making it great for smaller spaces.

The Echo Dot Max strikes a nice balance between practical and fun. It delivers full sound that’s impressive for its size, making it great for listening to music and audiobooks. The Alexa-enabled speaker can also help your giftee stay on top of everyday tasks, serving as an alarm clock, sending alerts, and even acting as a smart home controller.

Not sure what her favorite perfume is? The Sephora Favorites Smells Like Love Sampler Set with a redeemable voucher is a great option, offering nine popular fragrances in travel sizes that your giftee can have fun testing. The real highlight is the included voucher, which they can use to get a slightly bigger version of their favorite perfume from the lineup.
