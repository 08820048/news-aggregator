summary: "Welcome to the weekend, folks! The Reviews and Guides team here at The Verge is gearing up for all things Unpacked, but Samsung isn’t the only one readying new phones. Google just announced the Pixel 10A, which, for you early adopters, is already up for preorder with a $100 gift card. Elsewhere in deal land, you’ll find steep discounts on mopping vacuums, slight discounts on Soundcore’s cheap ANC headphones, and a rare discount on a new PC controller with swiveling sticks. So, let’s get to it, shall we? We finally have a release date for the Pixel 10A: March 5th. What’s more, if you’re thinking about picking up Google’s latest phone, you can already preorder the base-model configuration at Amazon and Best Buy with 128GB of storage and a $100 gift card for $499. Alternatively, Amazon is offering it with a free pair of the Pixel Buds 2A, a fantastic set of recently released earbuds that typically retail for $130. Despite being a pretty minimal update, Google’s forthcoming Android handset is a pretty solid deal. It doesn’t adopt a lot of features from the flagship Pixel 10 series; however, last year’s Tensor G4 chip is still speedy enough for most tasks, satellite SOS is handy, and you get slightly faster wired and wireless charging. More importantly, it still comes with seven years of OS and security updates, which, personally, I’d take over Magic Cue, Pixel Screenshots, and other AI-based tools any day of the week. Read our hands-on impressions. Google Pixel 10A Where to Buy: $599 $499 at Amazon (free $100 gift card) $629 $499 at Amazon (free Pixel Buds 2A) $599 $499 at Best Buy (free $100 gift card) Twelve. That’s how many AC outlets Anker’s 351 Power Strip — which is now available in black or white from Amazon and Anker for $23.99 ($6 off) — packs into its 9.65-inch, surge-protected build. The beefy power strip also features a 20W USB-C port and two USB-A ports, both of which can deliver up to 15W of juice. Just keep in mind that, like with most power strips and like-minded chargers, you’ll have to split power amongst the USB ports, which are limited to a max output of 15W when charging multiple devices simultaneously. Anker 351 Power Strip Where to Buy: $29.99 $23.99 at Amazon $29.99 $23.99 at Anker (with code WS7DV2YWISTS) I’m admittedly not a huge fan of fighting games — I have no patience for learning combos, dear readers — but the Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot seems like a good compromise if I were forced to choose between a traditional controller and one specifically built for hammering out hadokens. And now, the novel gamepad is on sale at both Amazon and Best Buy for $99.99 ($40 off), its lowest price to date. Although Turtle Beach’s wireless PC controller offers a slew of welcome components, including drift-free Hall effect joysticks and adjustable trigger stops, its defining feature is a pair of rotating modules that can “pivot” to reveal a customizable controller layout that’s better suited for retro titles and fighting games. You also get programmable back buttons, the ability to save up to five profiles, and a 3.5mm audio jack, not to mention compatibility with mobile devices over Bluetooth and Xbox consoles via a wired connection. Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot Where to Buy: $139.99 $99.99 at Amazon $139.99 $99.99 at Best Buy If you’re looking for a cheap(ish) set of noise-canceling headphones, Soundcore’s Space One are on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and directly from Soundcore (with code WS7DV2G0S7DJ) in all four colors for $79.99 ($20 off), matching their second-best price to date. During Cyber Monday last year, our own John Higgins waxed poetic about the over-ear cans, namely because they deliver impressive sound and comfort for the price. The sound quality and ANC don’t rival the flagships from Sony or Bose, sure, but you can try over 20 different presets or tweak the sound yourself using the eight-band equalizer in Anker’s companion app. They can also last up to 40 hours with ANC enabled, meaning you should be able to fly from New York to Singapore and back again without ever having to charge them. Soundcore Space One Where to Buy: $99 $79.99 at Amazon $99.99 $79.99 at Soundcore (with code WS7DV2G0S7DJ) $99.99 $79.99 at Walmart More ways to save this weekend Google’s refreshed Nest Cam Indoor, which launched in October, is already down to a new low of $74.99 ($25 off) at Amazon. The wired camera supports 2K HDR video and offers a taller and wider field of view than prior models, along with a new sensor for full-color low-light video. It also comes in a new berry color, which, for better or worse, seems to be Google’s latest obsession. After a quick series of price drops, Piggyback’s Metroid Prime 1–3: A Visual Retrospective has settled in at $36.59 (about $13 off) at Amazon and Walmart, which is the best price we’ve seen on the excellent hardcover. We rarely go out of our way to flag tabletop books at The Verge, but given the treasure trove of stunning concept art and the behind-the-scenes stories on display here, we thought we’d make an exception. It even features assets that never appeared in the trilogy, as if the original mock-ups and juicy developer commentary weren’t enough. Read our review. Eufy’s Robot Vacuum Omni S2 is right around the corner — which is probably why the Omni S1 Pro is available for an all-time low of $699.99 ($800 off) at Eufy’s online storefront when you use promo code WS24T2080111. The robovac / mop hybrid is still a great option for hardwood floors despite being a last-gen pick, especially since it can self-wash and dry its own roller mop as it cleans. It also features AI-powered obstacle avoidance and 8,000Pa of suction, which is enough power to pick up most debris."
