After cramming AI into every inch of its smartphones, appliances, and other devices, Samsung is now increasingly slapping it across social media. Several videos posted to the company’s YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok accounts in recent weeks were made or edited using generative AI tools, including its latest teaser for the upcoming Galaxy S26 series.

The “[Brighten your after hours](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/QkomSJ7P4O4)” video features two people skateboarding at night, and supposedly shows off the low-light video capabilities of the upcoming Galaxy S26 devices. Fine print appears at the bottom of the screen towards the end of the video, flagging that it was “generated with the assistance of AI tools,” but there are obvious signs even without the disclosure. The vegetable-laden shopping bags look artificial and unnaturally weighted, for example, and cobblestones in the road appear to shift around.

This video, and [several](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/WvvM3W8eDrI) [others](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/73QUwzWZ2Mc) that use AI to promote camera features, all carry the tag line “Can your phone do that?” but don’t specify if Samsung is using its own phones or AI models to generate the content. It wouldn’t be the first time that the company has [misrepresented its smartphone camera capabilities](https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/4/18125964/samsung-malaysia-galaxy-a8-star-dslr-photo-busted) in marketing materials. Samsung has also been posting [low-quality cartoons](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/fce5z5MxEH8) (which look [suspiciously](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/UjN5mkz6pFI) [Disney-styled](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/rrcqujffiv0)) to promote AI home appliances, [cat edits](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Bi7kckaDEKw), and [snowmen](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2ZNe79tFEUY) who are ironically struggling to determine what’s real — all made or manipulated using AI.

Most include a similar AI disclosure in the clips, but YouTube and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/DUy81HQEnUv/) notably haven’t added their own AI labels on the “Brighten your after hours” video, despite Google, Meta, and Samsung all having [adopted C2PA](https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24223932/c2pa-standard-verify-ai-generated-images-content-credentials) — the authenticity standard used by most AI labeling systems. We have reached out to Samsung, Meta, and Google for comment.
