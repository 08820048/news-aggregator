The social media giant announced on Monday that with its new “Arrival Notifications,” users can now set one-time or recurring alerts for locations beyond their home, providing an automatic way to share when they’ve arrived at specific places. “Arrival Notifications now work for everyday moments — like letting someone know you’re back for the night while traveling, or automatically sharing when you arrive at a weekly class, practice, or meeting — without needing to remember to send a message,” the company wrote in a blog post.

It’s worth noting that location sharing on Snap Map is off by default. No one can see your location or receive an alert unless you choose to share it, Snapchat explained. One-time alerts expire after they’re sent or after 24 hours. To use Arrival Notifications, you need to share your location with a trusted friend that you want to keep in the loop. Then, you need to tap on your friendship profile and scroll down to “Arrival Notifications.” You can pick a location on the map and give it a personal name. For example, you could set the location for your “run club” or the location for “piano lessons.” You can then choose a one-time or recurring alert, after which Snapchat will notify your friend when you arrive. The new feature comes as Snapchat announced last summer that Snap Map now has more than 400 million monthly active users. Snap Map, which launched in 2017, was originally a way for users to see their friends’ locations and browse public snaps from around the world. The feature now also offers ways for users to discover local hotspots and find things to do. Techcrunch event Boston, MA | June 23, 2026 With its Home Safe and Arrival Notifications features, Snapchat is looking to further compete with services like the family location-sharing app Life360 and Apple’s “Find My.” Topics Aisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.
