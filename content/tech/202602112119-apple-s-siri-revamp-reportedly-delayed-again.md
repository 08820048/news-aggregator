Apple has been promising a new-and-improved, cutting-edge, AI-powered Siri since it first [unveiled](https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-intelligence-is-the-companys-new-generative-ai-offering/) Apple Intelligence in 2024. Over about a year and a half since then, the release date for this new era of Siri has been continuously pushed back. According to a new [report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-11/apple-s-ios-26-4-siri-update-runs-into-snags-in-internal-testing-ios-26-5-27) from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, we’ll likely have to wait even longer.

While the new Siri was expected to launch with the upcoming iOS 26.4 update in March, now, the changes are expected to roll out more slowly over time, reportedly postponing some features until the May iOS update, or even until the release of iOS 27 in September. Apparently, Apple ran into trouble when testing the software, requiring the launch date to be pushed back further.

The changes are rumored to make the longtime digital assistant more like the LLM chatbots that have swept the tech world — but instead of opening up a ChatGPT or Claude app on your iPhone or MacBook, you would be able to just talk to Siri, which will be powered by [Google Gemini](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/googles-gemini-to-power-apples-ai-features-like-siri/).

We’re starting to feel bad for the Siri product managers. Hang in there, folks.
