summary: "Of course, it’s the guy who constantly complains about voter fraud who may have committed voter fraud. | Image: The Verge For all his bluster about voter fraud, Elon Musk has been one of the most flagrant flaunters of US election law. Now his America PAC has been slapped with a reprimand by the Georgia State Election Board for sending out pre-filled absentee ballot applications. State law prohibits anyone, other than an authorized relative, from sending an absentee ballot application prefilled with the elector's information.

For all his [bluster](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278643/xs-biggest-anti-immigrant-poster-is-elon-musk) about [voter fraud](https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/4/24285822/philadelphia-mail-in-ballot-counting-machines-misinformation), Elon Musk has been one of the most flagrant flaunters of US election law. Now his America PAC has been slapped with a [reprimand](https://newrepublic.com/post/206857/georgia-voter-fraud-elon-musk) by the [Georgia State Election Board](https://www.11alive.com/article/news/politics/georgia-state-election-board-letter-of-reprimand-america-pac-pre-filled-absentee-ballot-applications/85-ddb4f02a-a78a-4931-80e7-0fab668727c4) for sending out pre-filled absentee ballot applications. [State law](https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/title-21/chapter-2/article-10/section-21-2-381/) prohibits anyone, other than an authorized relative, from sending an absentee ballot application prefilled with the elector’s information.

Residents of Chattooga, Cherokee, Coweta, Floyd, and Whitfield counties reported receiving absentee ballot applications from America PAC, partially pre-filled. According to the State Election Board, the applications also failed to note that they were not actual ballots and were not provided by the government, as is required by law.

At the State Election Board meeting on February 18th, the panel quickly handed down the reprimand. America PAC did not appear to send a representative or submit a statement in defense of its actions.

This is just the latest example of Musk testing the limits of election law after he repeatedly suggested paying people to sign a petition and register to vote in [Pennsylvania](https://apnews.com/article/musk-1-million-giveaway-trump-voters-petition-b4e48acbfe04fde735e60b1911ad0197), [Wisconsin](https://www.theverge.com/news/633834/elon-musk-paying-voters-petition-wisconsin-supreme-court-race), and other swing states. It’s also another incident in which those who claim to be most concerned about election integrity have been [caught](https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/21/23273007/kari-lake-arizona-governor-jake-hoffman-karrin-taylor-robson-rally-forge-pac) potentially violating the law.
