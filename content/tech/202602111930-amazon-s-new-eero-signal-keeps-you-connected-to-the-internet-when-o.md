Amazon-owned [eero](https://eero.com/)‘s new $99.99 eero Signal 4G LTE, [announced](https://blog.eero.com/eero-signal-calm-cool-and-connected/) Wednesday, serves as an instant backup when your internet goes down, provided you have an eero subscription.

Customers plug the new eero Signal into any compatible USB-C powered eero device that has Wi-Fi 6 or higher. The eero Signal automatically switches to cellular when an outage occurs, then returns to Standby mode when service is restored.

It’s ideal for work-from-home employees, those needing security systems to stay online, or those in areas prone to outages.

Because the cellular network is only used intermittently, the subscription costs less than most comparable 4G LTE plans. At launch, users can choose between a $99.99 annual eero Plus subscription with 10 GB of backup data or a $199.99 eero Plus 100 plan with 100 GB of data. Both offer discounted pricing when you first purchase the device.

Later this year, the company will also launch a 5G version of the eero Signal for $199.99, and support for the device will come to those on eero Business plans, as well.
