Indian vibe-coding platform [Emergent](https://emergent.sh/) was launched just eight months ago, and it now says it’s generating annual run-rate revenue of more than $100 million, thanks to surging demand by small businesses and non-technical users.

The startup on Tuesday said it had doubled its annual run-rate revenue to $100 million in the past month, and it now has more than 6 million users worldwide across 190 countries, of which about 150,000 are paying customers. Emergent claims its users have created over 7 million applications on its platform.

Nearly 40% of Emergent’s users are small businesses, and about 70% have no prior coding experience. People mostly use the platform to digitize operations previously run on spreadsheets, email or messaging apps, and to build custom software, co-founder and CEO Mukund Jha told TechCrunch.

Emergent’s rapid growth comes as interest in “vibe-coding,” or using AI to code software, skyrockets around the world. The demand seems to be mostly driven by non-technical users who want to build production-ready applications using natural language and AI agents, though plenty of developers have turned to using such platforms to reduce their workloads.

The startup competes with the likes of Replit, Lovable, [Rocket.new](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/rocket-new-one-of-indias-first-vibe-coding-startups-snags-15m-from-accel-salesforce-ventures/), [Wabi,](https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/replika-founder-raises-20m-pre-seed-for-wabi-the-youtube-of-apps/) and [Anything](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/vibe-coding-startup-anything-nabs-a-100m-valuation-after-hitting-2m-arr-in-its-first-two-weeks/), among others.

Jha said most users on Emergent are building business-facing apps such as custom CRMs, ERPs, and inventory management and logistics tools. About 80% to 90% of new projects are focused on mobile apps, reflecting demand for software that can be deployed quickly and used on the go.

Emergent generates revenue through a mix of subscriptions, usage-based pricing, and deployment and hosting fees, Jha said, adding that all three segments are growing rapidly and that the company’s gross margins are improving every month.

“Growth is accelerating,” Jha told TechCrunch. “As the models and platforms are improving, we’re seeing a lot more users getting to success.”

While usage today is dominated by consumers and small businesses, the company has begun testing an enterprise offering, and is running pilots with “a small number of customers” to better understand requirements around security, compliance and governance, Jha said.

The U.S. and Europe account for roughly 70% of Emergent’s overall revenue, though India is the startup’s next-largest and fastest-growing market, supported by local pricing that has driven adoption among small businesses.

Emergent on Tuesday also launched a mobile app for iOS and Android that lets users create apps and publish them directly to Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store. The app is currently in testing, though its users have already built more than 10,000 applications, the startup said.

The app lets users type in text prompts or converse with AI using voice to build apps, websites, or platforms. The startup noted that users can also switch between the mobile app and the desktop version without losing context or progress.

Jha said the mobile launch reflects the platform’s asynchronous, agent-based workflow, where users delegate tasks to AI and return later to review progress. With a growing share of users already accessing the platform via mobile browsers and a large proportion of apps being built for mobile use, he said extending those workflows to a native app was a natural next step.

The San Francisco-headquartered startup, with an office in Bengaluru, drew attention in January after [raising $70 million in a funding round](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/indian-vibe-coding-startup-emergent-raises-70m-at-300m-valuation-from-softbank-khosla-ventures/) jointly led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Khosla Ventures, less than four months after closing a $23 million Series A. The financing tripled Emergent’s valuation to $300 million.
