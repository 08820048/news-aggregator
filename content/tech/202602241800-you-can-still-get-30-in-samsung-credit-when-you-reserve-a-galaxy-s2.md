summary: "Samsung is set to introduce its new Galaxy S26 lineup at its next Unpacked event on February 25th, potentially alongside a new pair of earbuds and other wearables. If you’re thinking about picking up any of the new devices, it’s worth claiming Samsung’s $30 promotional credit before it expires, which you can do by registering your interest on Samsung’s website before 1PM ET / 10AM PT tomorrow. If you’re even remotely considering an upgrade, there’s not much to lose by signing up. You don’t need to pay anything or even offer your credit card details to take advantage of the offer. You just need to reserve a device by signing up with your name and email address on Samsung’s website or the Shop Samsung app ahead of the event. Once the devices are officially announced and preorders open, you’ll be able to apply the $30 credit at checkout. Sadly, you can’t use the $30 credit to reduce the cost of your phone or any other Samsung device announced during Unpacked; however, you can use it for all kinds of accessories. Alongside the $30 credit, Samsung is offering up to $900 in credit when you trade in your phone at the time of purchase. For instance, trading in an S24 Ultra could net you up to $700 in credit. Your phone will have to meet certain eligibility requirements, though, and can’t exhibit damage beyond normal wear and tear. We don’t know yet exactly what the Galaxy S26 lineup will bring, but early rumors point to a built-in privacy mode that can fully black out content from select apps or parts of the display. Reports also suggest we’ll see more Galaxy AI features — particularly new AI-powered camera tools — along with a brighter camera system."
