As expected, Samsung has taken the wraps off its flagship lineup for 2026. Introduced during [the company’s recent Unpacked event](https://www.theverge.com/e/883932), the new Galaxy devices — which include the standard S26, the larger S26 Plus, and the high-end S26 Ultra — will be available on March 11th. Preorders are now open ahead of launch, with pricing starting at $899.99 for the base-model S26, $1,099.99 for the Plus, and $1,299.99 for the Ultra.

Overall, the forthcoming S26 lineup looks largely similar to [last year’s S25 series](https://www.theverge.com/reviews/610404/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review-screen-battery-camera), only with a handful of notable upgrades. The biggest changes this year are on the software side, with Samsung introducing a privacy display in the S26 Ultra that hides what you’re looking at from others. You also get new AI-powered features enabled by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy processor, including a call screening tool and generative photo editing tools that allow you to type what you want changed. Samsung is also rolling out early support for a more advanced version of Gemini, which can handle certain tasks in supported apps without you having to do everything manually.

While the hardware is largely unchanged, battery capacity has increased across the lineup, and the Ultra is now available with an optional 16GB of RAM. The standard S26 and S26 Plus also feature slightly larger OLED displays and retail for $100 more, while the Ultra’s price remains unchanged at $1,299.99.

We’ve published our hands-on impressions of the [Galaxy S26, S26 Plus](https://www.theverge.com/tech/884239/samsung-galaxy-s26-plus-price-specs-gemini), and [S26 Ultra](https://www.theverge.com/tech/884337/samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-privacy-display-price), and full reviews are on the way. In the meantime, if you’re ready to reserve your preorder, here’s where you can secure an S26, S26 Plus, or S26 Ultra ahead of their release next month.

## Where to preorder the Samsung Galaxy S26

At $899.99, the Galaxy S26 is the most affordable option in Samsung’s 2026 lineup. It comes with 12GB of RAM and your choice of either 128GB or 256GB of storage (the latter costs $200 more). The phone is available for preorder from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Unlocked-Smartphone-Processor-Immersive/dp/B0GHC4F7MR?tag=theverge02-20), [Best Buy](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s26-512gb-unlocked-black%2FJJGRF3T2VP), and [Samsung](https://howl.link/7bs4arfqxil88), the latter of which is offering it in several exclusive colors.

The S26 remains the smallest phone in the lineup, though its display has expanded slightly to 6.3 inches, up from 6.2 inches on the S25. Like the other phones in the S26 lineup, it runs on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 processor. It also features a slightly larger  battery than its predecessor (4,300mAh  vs. 4,000mAh ), but is otherwise similar, with a 120Hz refresh rate and the same camera setup: a 50-megapixel main sensor, a 12-megapixel ultrawide, a 10-megapixel telephoto, and a 12-megapixel front-facing camera.

If you’re looking for a deal, Amazon is currently offering a $100 gift card when you preorder either the [256GB](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Unlocked-Smartphone-Processor-Immersive/dp/B0GHC4F7MR?tag=theverge02-20) or [512GB models](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Unlocked-Smartphone-Processor-Immersive/dp/B0GHBJP6QQ?th=1&tag=theverge02-20) for $899.99. [Best Buy](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s26-512gb-unlocked-black%2FJJGRF3T2VP), meanwhile, is offering a $200 discount on the 512GB model, sans gift card.

## Where to preorder the Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus

As of right now, you can preorder the Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus starting at $1,099.99 directly from [Samsung](https://howl.link/ih80igojupbxg), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Unlocked-Smartphone-Processor-Immersive/dp/B0GGTNP8XB?tag=theverge02-20), and [Best Buy](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s26-512gb-unlocked-black%2FJJGRF36SP9) (the 512GB model is available from the same retailers for $200 extra). Like the S26, it’s available in a range of colors, with Samsung offering several exclusive shades online.

The S26 Plus is the middle child of the S26 lineup. It offers all the same features as the S26 — including the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy processor and 12GB of RAM — but with a larger, sharper 6.7-inch display. It also features a larger 4,900mAh battery to power its bigger display, making it a good choice for those who want a large screen without splurging on the step-up S26 Ultra.

In terms of deals, Amazon is offering a $100 gift card when you preorder either the [256GB](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Unlocked-Smartphone-Processor-Immersive/dp/B0GGTNP8XB?tag=theverge02-20) or [512GB model for $1,099.99](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Unlocked-Smartphone-Processor-Immersive/dp/B0GGTMQG4M/?tag=theverge02-20), which is a $200 discount. [Samsung](https://howl.link/5ur9j6ojvqq19) is also offering $150 in credit with each preorder, while [Best Buy](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s26-512gb-unlocked-black%2FJJGRF36SP9) is offering a free storage upgrade, allowing you to purchase the 512GB model for $1,099.99 ($200 off).

## Where to preorder the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra

The base Galaxy S26 Ultra comes with 12GB of RAM and starts at $1,299.99 for 256GB of storage, $1,499.99 for the 512GB, and $1,799.99 for 1TB. The S26 Ultra is currently available for preorder from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Unlocked-Smartphone-Charging-Warranty/dp/B0GGTKVTH2/?tag=theverge02-20), [Best Buy](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-512gb-unlocked-black%2FJJGRF36Y3Q), and [Samsung](https://howl.link/esatkcxkjuglz), with the silver and pinkish gold colorways exclusive to Samsung’s online store.

The 6.9-inch S26 Ultra is the largest and most capable phone in the S26 lineup. It’s also the only phone in the lineup to offer a privacy display, which makes it harder for people nearby to see what’s on your screen. The Ultra also includes Samsung’s S Pen stylus and a more advanced camera system with two telephoto lenses and a 200-megapixel wide-angle camera. You also get a 5,000mAh battery, the largest in the lineup.

If you’re looking to save, Amazon is throwing in a $200 gift card when you preorder the [256GB model for $1,299.99](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Unlocked-Smartphone-Charging-Warranty/dp/B0GGTKVTH2?th=1&tag=theverge02-20) or the [512GB variant](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Unlocked-Smartphone-Charging-Warranty/dp/B0GGT7CXF5?tag=theverge02-20) for the same price, which is a $200 discount. [Samsung](https://howl.link/esatkcxkjuglz) is also offering $150 in credit when you preorder the phone, while [Best Buy](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-512gb-unlocked-black%2FJJGRF36Y3Q) is offering a $200 discount on the 512GB model.
