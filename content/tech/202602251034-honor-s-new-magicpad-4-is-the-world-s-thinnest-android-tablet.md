Last year's MagicPad 3 was just 5.8mm thick, but the new MagicPad 4 squeezes that down to 4.8mm.

is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.

Honor has announced a new version of its already slim MagicPad tablet that’s now even thinner. Last year’s [MagicPad 3 was just 5.8mm thick](https://www.theverge.com/news/767351/honor-magic-v5-foldable-magicpad-3-magicbook-art-14), but the new MagicPad 4 squeezes that down to 4.8mm. That’s thinner than the 6.1mm thick [iPad Air](https://www.theverge.com/ipad/626647/apple-ipad-air-review-2025) and 5.1mm [iPad Pro](https://www.theverge.com/24155440/apple-ipad-pro-2024-review), or the 5.1mm thick [Samsung Galaxy Tab S11](https://www.theverge.com/phones/768658/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-tab-s11-ultra), and only bested by E Ink tablets like the [reMarkable 2](https://www.theverge.com/21403489/remarkable-2-e-ink-paper-tablet-review), at 4.7mm.

The MagicPad 4 has a slightly smaller 12.3-inch screen than its 13.3-inch predecessor. But that’s a minor trade-off given the new tablet now uses a 165Hz OLED display instead of LCD. Its battery is, not surprisingly, also a bit smaller at 10,100mAh, and while Honor hasn’t shared battery life estimates, the new OLED screen could potentially help it outlast last year’s model. Thanks to everything being smaller and thinner, the new MagicPad 4 weighs about 145 grams lighter than the MagicPad 3.

The tablet is powered by a [Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 5](https://www.theverge.com/news/828959/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-5) chipset paired with either 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, or 16GB and 512GB. It runs MagicOS 10, which is based on Android 16, and you’ll find a 13MP camera on the back with a 9MP camera on the front. Its photography capabilities may be basic, but like last year’s model, the MagicPad 4 excels at audio with a total of eight speakers providing a spatial audio experience. If you like annoying other passengers on a flight by forcing the sound of the movie you’re watching onto everyone around you, this could be a tablet worth considering.

Honor hasn’t announced pricing or availability for the tablet, but that’s likely to come during its MWC press conference on Sunday, when it has also [teased it will reveal a move into humanoid robotics](https://www.theverge.com/tech/882959/honor-is-pivoting-to-robots).
