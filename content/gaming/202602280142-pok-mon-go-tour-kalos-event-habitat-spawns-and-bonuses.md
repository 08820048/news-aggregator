[_Pokémon Go_](https://www.polygon.com/game/pokemon-go/38713/)'s yearly "Go Tour" event this year focuses on the **Kalos** region, with the global version of the event running on **Feb. 28 and March 1, from 10 a.m. until 6 p.m.** in your local time. Rather than a big fancy legendary with multiple forms, this year's Go Tour focuses on the launch of [Super Mega Raids](https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-super-mega-raids-link-charges-how-to-get/), debuting Mega Malamar, Mega Victreebell, and Mega Dragonite.

As usual with these premier events, there's a ton to do during **Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos**, so we're here to break down the perks that you get as a free player versus the ones you get for paying for the ticket and provide you with the rotating schedules and habitats for the event.

## Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos egg hatches

Any eggs obtained during the event period has a chance to hatch any of the Pokémon in the table below. Note that the 10 km egg hatches are regional Pokémon, so if you're still missing these from your Pokédex, now is a good day to take a long walk. (Though keep in mind that you can get Kangaskhan and Heracross from Mega Raids... though you can't really control your egg luck, so... Let's just all hope you get Hawlucha and Klefki instead of those.)

2 km
