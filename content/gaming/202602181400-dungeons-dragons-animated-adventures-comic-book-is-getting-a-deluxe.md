The [_Dungeons & Dragons_](https://www.polygon.com/dnd-dungeons-dragons/) Saturday morning cartoon aired from 1983 to 1985, and the weird tale of a group of six kids who ride a roller coaster into the fantasy tabletop role-playing game is still inspiring writers and game designers. The characters popped up in the 2023 film [_Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves_](https://www.polygon.com/23664885/1980s-dungeons-and-dragons-dnd-cartoon-honor-among-thieves-cameo-death/), and Wizards of the Coast created an [adventure based on the show](https://www.dndbeyond.com/claim/source/uni-and-the-hunt-for-the-lost-horn) to introduce the 2024 rules. The series was a big influence on Kieron Gillen and Stephanie Hans’ dark comic book series [_Die_](https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/10/18131140/die-kieron-gillen-rpg-image-comics/), and got its own [comic adaptation](https://www.polygon.com/23509684/dungeons-dragons-cartoon-comic-book-limited-series/) from IDW in 2022, which will be collected into a deluxe hardcover edition releasing this summer.

_Dungeons & Dragons: Animated Adventures Library Edition_ contains IDW’s three _Saturday Morning Adventures_ four-issue miniseries, which are meant to represent lost episodes of the cartoon. The comics are written by David M. Booher (_Ghostbusters_) and Sam Maggs ([_Critical Role_](https://www.polygon.com/2021/8/24/22639618/critical-role-origins-nott-the-brave-cover-reveal-dark-horse-sam-maggs/)) and illustrated by George Kambadais (_Gargoyles_) and Jack Lawrence (_Transformers_). While the show was set in a generic fantasy world, the comics take place within D&D’s [Forgotten Realms](https://www.polygon.com/dungeons-dragons-dnd-forgotten-realms-adventures-heroes-review-impressions/) campaign setting.

The young heroes were given magic items by the enigmatic Dungeon Master that allow them to take on the powers of D&D classes, becoming Hank the Ranger, Eric the Cavalier, Diana the Acrobat, Presto the Magician, Sheila the Thief, and Bobby the Barbarian. The show’s old enough that some of these classes no longer exist in the current rules of the game. While they were always trying to get home, the kids tended to find reasons to stay in the fantasy world to protect Bobby’s pet baby unicorn, Uni, and people in need. In the comics, they explore a spooky monastery in [Waterdeep](https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/11/17845902/dungeons-and-dragons-waterdeep-dragon-heist-review/), fight pirates on the Sword Coast, and encounter dragons while trying to take a relaxing trip to the beach.

Releasing on Aug. 4, the $49.99 book features new cover art from Rex Xie depicting Venger, the powerful mage who was the show’s primary villain. It will also feature a gallery of variant cover art. Preorders for _Dungeons & Dragons: Animated Adventures Library Adventures_ are open now from Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and local stores.
