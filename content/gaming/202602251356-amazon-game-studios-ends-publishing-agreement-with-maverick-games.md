Amazon Game Studios has ended its publishing agreement with Maverick Games as it "focuses on projects that leverage Amazon's unique strengths and scale."

As reported by [The Game Business](https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/amazon-abandons-its-open-world-driving), Amazon said this decision "allows Maverick the flexibility to find a publishing partner whose strategic priorities are better aligned with bringing their game to market."

Amazon [signed Maverick's debut game in May 2024.](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/amazon-signs-debut-title-from-playground-alumni-maverick-games) The open-world, narrative-driven driving title will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

In a statement shared with _GamesIndustry.biz_, Maverick co-founder and COO Harinder Sangha said development of the game "continues to progress as strongly as planned" despite the agreement ending.

"We're in active dialogue with partners who share our long-term ambition for the IP and look forward to sharing more later this year."
