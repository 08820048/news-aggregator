The popular dark romance book Lights Out by Navessa Allen is in development for a TV adaptation at Netflix, as reported by [Deadline](https://deadline.com/2026/02/lights-out-book-series-adaptation-netflix-navessa-allen-1236714481/). Allen also shared the news on her [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DUoTKqKEdOM/?igsh=MTgxZGlzYXFuYzdlcQ==), referencing rumors that fans wanted a movie – and surprised them with the news that Lights Out is being adapted for a series instead.

The book will be adapted by Hannah Schneider, who will serve as writer, showrunner, and executive producer. Schneider is known for producing on the dark comedy Why Women Kill and the crime drama The Waterfront. Peter Chernin and Tracey Cook will executive produce as well, from Chernin Entertainment.

Lights Out is the first book in Allen's Into Darkness series, published in February 2024. [Allen sited fans on TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@navessa.allen/video/7460268714512911647) as creating the surge in popularity, as well as getting Lights Out on the New York Times Bestseller list, which has now been on the list for 52 weeks. The sequel, Caught Up, released in June 2025 and landed immediately at #1 on the New York Times Bestseller list. The next book, Game On, is set to release on March 31.

Lights Out follows two main characters in POV chapters – Aly, a trauma nurse who has been obsessing over a masked, tattooed man who posts thirst traps on social media, and Josh, said man who works in cybersecurity and can hack his way into Aly's house to give her the fantasy she desires.

The book is known for being a dark stalker story with 27 trigger warnings – but it also has a rom-com style to keep things light at times. It's unknown if Netflix will also adapt the other books in the series.

Lights Out isn't the first dark romance to be adapted to screen by a streaming service, with Netflix also scooping up the [dark fantasy romance book Quicksilver](https://www.ign.com/articles/netflixs-quicksilver-callie-hart-gives-script-update-says-shed-love-robert-eggers-as-director) by Callie Hart and Rebecca Yarros' [Fourth Wing being adapted](https://www.ign.com/articles/amazons-fourth-wing-tv-series-taps-meredith-averill-as-new-showrunner) into a TV series at Amazon.
