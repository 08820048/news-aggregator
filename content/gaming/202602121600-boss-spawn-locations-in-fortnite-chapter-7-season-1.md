**Bosses** are stronger NPC opponents that give you powerful buffs in [_Fortnite_](https://www.polygon.com/game/fortnite/2417/) Chapter 7 Season 1. In past seasons, bosses were known to spawn in a singular location, but now, their spawns are interchangable and there are a _lot_ of different spawn points.

Rather than heading to their usual POI, you'll now have to travel around the map, or take down someone who has already defeated the boss and acquired their buff. Each boss has their own unique buff that allows you to transform into them, and they all drop a powerful mythic weapon for you to use. However, your location will also be marked on the map for anyone nearby.

Below, we've listed **where to find the bosses in _Fortnite_ Chapter 7 Season 1**, along with their buffs and what mythic weapon they drop.

**Update (Feb. 18):** Added information on the Yule Trooper boss and more boss spawn locations.

## Boss locations in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1

    ![Fortnite boss spawn locations marked on the Chapter 7 Season 1 map.](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/c7s1-winter-boss-locations_fn-1.jpg?q=70&fit=crop&w=750&dpr=1)Graphic: Johnny Yu/Polygon | Source images: Epic Games via Polygon

All three bosses (Beach Brutus, Human Bill, and Hush) will spawn at the start of the game, and their spawn points will vary between every match. Additionally, each boss can spawn at **any** of the locations marked on the map above — meaning no location is specific to one boss.If you're trying to collect boss tokens to complete the Week 2 quest, we recommend getting into a car and searching the bottom half of the map as there appear to be more spawn points.These are all of the boss spawn locations that we've found so far:

-   [Pump N' Run Gas Station](https://www.polygon.com/all-pump-n-run-gas-station-locations-in-fortnite-chapter-7/) east of Wonkeeland
-   Clawsy Lodge parking lot
-   Wonkeeland parking lot
-   Red-roofed house southeast of Wonkeeland
-   Pumping station to the west of Painted Palms
-   East side of Painted Palms
-   Beach to the west of Bumpy Bay
-   North side of Lethal Loop
-   Underground area of Lethal Loop
-   Pump N' Run Gas Station south of Sandy Strip
-   On the golf course in Fore Fields
-   Beach to the west of Humble Hills
-   Humble Hills
-   House to the south of Lethal Loop

## Boss token power ups and drops in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1

Once you defeat a boss, they'll drop a token that will transform you into them, but they'll also make you visible on the map to nearby players. Each token will **increase your shield and health total to 125**, **heal you to full shield and health**, **give you infinite energy**, **summon two henchfans**, and provide you with a **unique ability** — which we list in the table below — all on a **90-second cooldown**. To counteract all of the benefits, your location will be visible to nearby players at all times.Additionally, they'll drop a powerful mythic weapon that you can use to destroy your enemies.

In the table below, we've listed each bosses' unique ability and the mythic weapon that they drop.

Brutus' Twin Hammer Shotguns

Human Bill

## Where to find Bigfoot in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1

    ![Bigfoot sitting in a rocking chair playing a banjo in Fortnite.](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/bigfoot_fn.jpg?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2)Image: Epic Games via Polygon

Unfortunately, the Bigfoot boss works just like the other bosses in _Fortnite_ Chapter 7 Season 1, and you'll need to find them in one of the boss locations around the map. It's currently unclear whether they're more likely to spawn in the new wooded areas of the map, but we recommend dropping near Clawsly Lodge and Wonkeeland as there is a cluster of boss spawns in the area.
