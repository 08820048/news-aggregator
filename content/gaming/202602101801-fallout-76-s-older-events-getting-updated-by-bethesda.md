After Burning Springs, it's time to improve the rest of the map

## Fallout 76's old and outdated events are getting a glow up

It's been a couple of months since the [Burning Springs](http://b/) update launched in [_Fallout 76_](https://www.polygon.com/game/fallout-76/40362/), adding a chunk of the great state of Ohio to the existing Appalachia map. While there is certainly more to be explored in that region, 2026 is going to find the team at Bethesda attempting to make the existing [_Fallout 76_ experience](https://www.polygon.com/fallout-76-crossplay-bethesda/) better.

In recent years, _Fallout 76_ has "been growing the play space with Skyline Valley \[and\] Burning Springs," creative director Jon Rush told Polygon in a video interview. "I would say the plans for what our plans look like for the next year or so are looking inwards and making the entire experience much more rich."

A major focus of that looking inward is addressing some of the older public events in the game, according to production director Bill LaCoste.

"We have events that have not been updated since launch, and they're outdated or didn't provide the rewards that players really wanted, or \[players\] had all the rewards, so there's no real reason to go to them," he explained. "We've made a really big update to a lot of those so that we can really revitalize some of them, make them more fun, and provide players with that minute-to-minute experience, instead of just waiting for the top of the hour for the next event to pop up."

This is good to hear for longtime players of the game, as many of the events still available simply aren't worth it anymore. A perfect example is the recently concluded Mothman Equinox event. It's a seasonal event that has run eight times since 2021, offering specialized items as rewards for those who complete it. Unfortunately, the rewards being offered this year are the same as the last Mothman Equinox, which makes the event a lot less interesting for those who were already playing a year ago.

Additionally, while the Burning Springs addition brought a brand-new chunk of the wasteland to explore in _Fallout 76_, it didn't take long to play through the first piece of the Rust King storyline, which is now at some sort of cliffhanger until whenever the next chapter drops. Meanwhile, the only things keeping Burning Springs interesting at this point are Head Hunts and the never-ending search for Abraxo briefcases, unless you've already ticked that mission off your list. Oh, and getting to say hi to Walton Goggins' The Ghoul whenever you please, though he won't respond.

Revitalizing the older events makes the existing map more exciting for those who have done everything there is to do. And for those just starting out, finding more fellow vault dwellers wandering the well-worn areas of the map looking for adventure immediately makes for a more welcoming experience — and hopefully an easier way to find a team.
