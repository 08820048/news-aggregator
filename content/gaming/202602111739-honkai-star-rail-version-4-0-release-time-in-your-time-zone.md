After a short delay, [_Honkai: Star Rail_'](https://www.polygon.com/game/honkai-star-rail/40897/)s **version 4.0** is finally launching. Notably, this patch is not launching on its usual day (Tuesday or Wednesday) but is instead being released on Thursday or Friday, depending on your time zone. This patch finally takes us to a new planet, Planarcadia, a place with relation to the Path of Elation.

Below, we explain when _Honkai: Star Rail_ maintenance starts and ends, alongside the release time of version 4.0. We’ve also added some details about what to expect from **_Honkai: Star Rail_ version 4.0**.

## What time does Honkai: Star Rail go down for maintenance?

_Honkai: Star Rail_ will go down for maintenance on **Thursday, Feb. 12 or Friday, Feb. 13** (depending on your time zone) at the following times and will be unavailable for approximately five hours:

-   **2 p.m. PST on Thursday, Feb. 12** for the west coast of North America
-   **5 p.m. EST on Thursday, Feb. 12** for the east coast of North America
-   **7 p.m. BRT on Thursday, Feb. 12** for Brazil
-   **10 p.m. GMT on Thursday, Feb. 12** for the U.K.
-   **11 p.m. CET on Thursday, Feb. 12** for western Europe
-   **7 a.m. JST on Friday, Feb. 13** for Japan
-   **9 a.m. AEDT on Friday, Feb. 13** for the east coast of Australia

Make sure to burn your fuel before maintenance starts, if you want to. Keep in mind that new trace materials and calyxes will be added in this patch for Elation characters, so you may want to hold on to _some_ of your fuel if you were planning on farming these out immediately.

## What time does Honkai: Star Rail version 4.0 start?

_Honkai: Star Rail_ should come back from maintenance with the 4.0 version at the following times:

-   **7 p.m. PST on Thursday, Feb. 12** for the west coast of North America
-   **10 p.m. EST on Thursday, Feb. 12** for the east coast of North America
-   **12 a.m. BRT on Friday, Feb. 13** for Brazil
-   **3 a.m. GMT on Friday, Feb. 13** for the U.K.
-   **4 a.m. CET on Friday, Feb. 13** for western Europe
-   **12 p.m. JST on Friday, Feb. 13** for Japan
-   **2 p.m. AEDT on Friday, Feb. 13** for the east coast of Australia

The servers may come up early or late, depending on how maintenance goes, but these are the approximate times the game should go live. Usually, Hoyoverse is pretty good by abiding by maintenance times. We don’t usually get extended maintenance, but it does end early sometimes!

## What’s new in Honkai: Star Rail version 4.0?

On Planarcadia, we'll meet a ton of new characters like Yao Guang, Evanescia (who may look familiar to those who like _Honkai Impact 3rd_), Nihilux, and Ashveil. There'll also be alternative versions of characters we've already met, like Sparxie, Blade, and Silver Wolf. This patch specifically will include playable versions of Sparxie (Fire Elation) and Yao Guang (Physical Elation).

There's also going to be quite a few quality-of-life improvements, like changes to the Assignment System that allow you to claim rewards at any time (rather than having to wait hours), and the ability to preview the hidden sub-stats your relic would roll without spending materials on actually rolling on the relic.
