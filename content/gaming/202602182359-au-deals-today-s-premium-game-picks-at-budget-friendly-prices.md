Another weekday, another excuse to pretend my backlog does not exist. I have sunk hours into most of these, paid for more than a few at full price, and none of them are here by accident. When discounts line up like this, it is less about hype and more about timing. Acquire before they expire.

## **This Day in Gaming 🎂**

In retro news, I'm celebrating the 17th birthday of **House of the Dead: Overkill** which (at 189 f-bombs dropped) is one of the sweariest video games ever made. Hilariously, it was released first on the more family-friendly Nintendo Wii console and eventually morphed into a kick arse [edutainment game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/246580/The_Typing_of_The_Dead_Overkill/) that taught you typing... via profanity! Bravo, Sega. Bra-#$%ing-vo.

-   [Super Mario RPG](https://www.amazon.com.au/Super-Mario-RPG/dp/B08WYWTMYL?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-38%) - **A$49.90** A confident remake of a 90s oddity that still feels playful. Timing based combat keeps it active, but it is short and light. Perfect if you want charm without a 100 hour commitment.
-   [Star Wars Outlaws Gold Ed.](https://www.amazon.com.au/Star-Wars-Outlaws-Gold-Edition/dp/B0FWKRYQ8F?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-34%) - **A$59** A scrappy open world Star Wars tale built around scoundrel energy instead of Jedi heroics. Side jobs are the real hook. Some stealth drags, but this is a fair entry point.
-   [Street Fighter 6 Years 1-2 Fighters Ed.](https://www.amazon.com.au/Street-Fighter-6-Years-1-2-Fighters-Edition/dp/B0F443L37F?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-24%) - **A$70.60** Still the cleanest modern fighter around. Welcoming controls, outrageous depth. Online can humble you quickly, but you are buying years of competitive longevity here.
-   [Streets of Rage 4](https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000026149) (-70%) - **A$11.20** Lean, crunchy brawling that understands why the 90s worked. Combat feels weighty and deliberate. It is short, but replaying for ranks is where the value lives.
-   [Diablo III Eternal Col.](https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000012303) (-67%) - **A$29.60** The most comfortable loot grind on Switch. Combat is simple but satisfying, seasons keep it relevant. Story fades fast, yet the build loop still quietly rules.

Or gift a [**Nintendo eShop Card**](https://zdcs.link/V0MbJ?object_uuid=54804156-d8fc-4b4d-b5a9-dda255176880&t=article).

## Exciting Bargains for Xbox

[

](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/27/princethumb-1743095455884.png)

-   [Prince of Persia The Lost Crown](https://www.amazon.com.au/Prince-of-Persia-The-Lost-Crown/dp/B0C7BPYTRC?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-62%) - **A$19** Tight platforming, smart combat, and genuinely clever map design. It respects your skill without being cruel. Story is serviceable, movement is the real star.
-   [Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War](https://www.amazon.com.au/Call-of-Duty-Black-Ops-Cold-War/dp/B08GSKVDSM?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-70%) - **A$32.90** A glossy, punchy campaign with classic Treyarch pacing. Multiplayer still hums. Not revolutionary, but at this discount it is dependable comfort food.
-   [Resident Evil 4](https://www.amazon.com.au/Resident-Evil-4/dp/B0BJTSN9ZC?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-42%) - **A$35** A masterclass remake that trims fat and sharpens tension. Combat is heavier, horror leans meaner. Still action forward, but now properly unnerving.
-   [Assassin's Creed Valhalla](https://www.amazon.com.au/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla/dp/B08CNP8DG6?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-56%) - **A$44.30** Vast Viking tourism with moments of brilliance. It runs long, sometimes too long, but the world building and combat weight justify this level of discount.
-   [Halo 5 Guardians](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/p/halo-5-guardians/BRRC2BP0G9P0/0001) (-75%) - **A$7.40** A divisive campaign, mechanically sharp shooting. Multiplayer remains fast and skill driven. For this price, it is hard to argue with more Halo.

**Xbox One**

-   [Dying Light 2 Stay Human](https://www.amazon.com.au/Dying-Light-2-Stay-Human/dp/B07DJXSCR1?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-70%) - **A$29.60** Parkour remains the star, especially at night when tension spikes. Story choices wobble, but free running across rooftops rarely gets old.
-   [Middle-earth Shadow of War](https://www.amazon.com.au/Middle-earth-Shadow-of-War/dp/B01LTIBIUM?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-70%) - **A$16.50** The Nemesis system is still magic. Orc rivalries feel personal and absurd. It bloats later, yet for this price the sandbox stories alone carry it.
-   [Sifu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/p/sifu/9P7PF6ZP3958/0010) (-75%) - **A$14.90** A disciplined, demanding brawler built on repetition and mastery. You will lose often. Improvement feels earned, and the combat is beautifully clean.

Or just invest in an [**Xbox Card**](https://zdcs.link/glwRb?object_uuid=54804156-d8fc-4b4d-b5a9-dda255176880&t=article).

## **Pure Scores for PlayStation**

[

](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/20/borderlands4thumb-1763656944674.png)

-   [Borderlands 4](https://www.amazon.com.au/Borderlands-4/dp/B0FDDVVHNC?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-59%) - **A$49** Loud, loot driven chaos with tighter gun feel than before. Writing still leans try hard, but co op carnage at this price is easy to justify.
-   [S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Heart of Chornobyl](https://www.amazon.com.au/S-T-A-L-K-E-R-2-Heart-of-Chornobyl/dp/B0FMQTNGYY?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-31%) - **A$59** Oppressive, systemic survival shooting with real atmosphere. Rough around the edges, yet the world feels alive in ways few shooters manage.
-   [Dead Space](https://www.amazon.com.au/Dead-Space/dp/B0BHH3F42H?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-73%) - **A$29.90** Clinical sci fi horror rebuilt with restraint. Sound design does half the work. Not for the squeamish, but an absolute steal here.
-   [LEGO Star Wars The Skywalker Saga](https://www.amazon.com.au/LEGO-Star-Wars-The-Skywalker-Saga/dp/B08J2HW5MK?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-60%) - **A$35.70** A massive, playful retelling of nine films with gentle puzzles and endless collectibles. Comfort gaming, especially in co-op.
-   [Shin Megami Tensei V Vengeance](https://www.amazon.com.au/Shin-Megami-Tensei-V-Vengeance/dp/B0CWLK798G?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-30%) - **A$69.90** Brutal, stylish turn based combat with deep demon fusion systems. Story runs cool, but the strategic depth makes this tempting.

**PS4**

-   [Sonic Superstars](https://www.amazon.com.au/SONIC-SUPERSTARS/dp/B0C7RD5RX7?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-47%) - **A$50.20** Classic 2D speed with a modern sheen. Momentum feels right, though some levels overcomplicate things. Best enjoyed in short, fast bursts.
-   [Super Bomberman R 2](https://www.amazon.com.au/SUPER-BOMBERMAN-R-2/dp/B0C1YPWPDD?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-57%) - **A$30.40** Chaotic party energy built on simple rules. Solo content is thin, but with friends it becomes wonderfully petty.
-   [Rogue Legacy](https://store.playstation.com/en-au/product/EP4488-CUSA00587_00-CDGROGUELEGACY01) (-90%) - **A$2.50** A foundational roguelite built on generational quirks and steady upgrades. It shows its age, yet at this price it is essential history.

Or purchase a [**PS Store Card.**](https://zdcs.link/kn6Ww?object_uuid=54804156-d8fc-4b4d-b5a9-dda255176880&t=article)

-   [God of War Ragnarok](https://zdcs.link/QPxb2W?object_uuid=54804156-d8fc-4b4d-b5a9-dda255176880&t=article) (-40%) - **A$57.40** Expansive, emotional spectacle with weighty combat. It runs beautifully on PC. Some pacing dips, yet the craft earns the discount.
-   [Hades II](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II) (-20%) - **A$35.10** How does it compare to the GOTY original? Combat feels faster and more flexible. Not finished, yet the foundation is seriously promising.
-   [Hades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades) (-65%) - **A$12.70** The rare roguelike that marries narrative and repetition. Every run feeds the story. If you somehow skipped it, this price fixes that.
