It’s a very bloody weekend on streaming. Nia DaCosta’s [_28 Years Later: The Bone Temple_](https://www.polygon.com/28-years-later-bone-temple-behind-the-scenes-video/) provides the perfect second entry in the planned post-apocalyptic trilogy as a twisted cult leader who believes he’s the son of Satan turns out to be far more dangerous than the infected. Watch Uma Thurman murder her former coworkers in [_The Whole Bloody Affair_](https://www.polygon.com/kill-bill-the-whole-bloody-affair-digital-release-date/), [Quentin Tarantino’s](https://www.polygon.com/quentin-tarantino-kill-bill-prequel-fortnite/) four-and-a-half-hour combined cut of _Kill Bill: Vol. 1_ and _Vol. 2_.

### 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple

-   **Genre:** Post-apocalyptic horror
-   **Run time:** 1h 49m
-   **Director:** Nia DaCosta
-   **Cast:** Ralph Fiennes, Jack O'Connell, Alfie Williams

Spike (Alfie Williams) is forced to join a sadistic cult led by Sir Lord Jimmy Crystal (Jack O'Connell), who kills and tortures other survivors of the rage virus. But when Jimmy’s leadership is called into question, he winds up on a collision course with the enigmatic Dr. Ian Kelson (Ralph Fiennes), leading to one of the [wildest scenes](https://www.polygon.com/28-years-later-the-bone-temple-iron-maiden-devil-scene/) in modern cinema.

From our [review](https://www.polygon.com/28-year-later-bone-temple-review/):

> O’Connell plays his part to perfection, earnestly selling the conceit that his character believes Satan sent both the rage virus and Jimmy himself to rid the world of human immorality. In a franchise defined by violent, sprinting zombies, O’Connell manages to be the scariest figure onscreen, though his followers often feel like interchangeable background actors just waiting to get killed off.
