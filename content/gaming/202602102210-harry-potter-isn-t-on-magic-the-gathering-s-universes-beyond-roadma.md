According to Wizards of the Coast, [Harry Potter](https://www.polygon.com/harry-potter/) won't be flying his broom anywhere near [_Magic: The Gathering_](https://www.polygon.com/mtg-magic-the-gathering/)'s multiverse — at least for the foreseeable future. Parent company Hasbro [announced](https://newsroom.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hasbro-and-warner-bros-discovery-global-consumer-products) on Feb. 10 that it had entered into a "multi-year licensing partnership" with Warner Bros. Discovery related to Harry Potter to release licensed "dolls, role play, action figures & collectibles, interactive plush, board games and more to be revealed later this year." _Magic_ fans immediately [speculated](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1r12ed3/do_we_think_wotc_would_potentially_touch_the_fire/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) it could lead to a Harry Potter Universes Beyond set. But the Wizards of the Coast community team quickly [responded](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1r12ed3/comment/o4metfg/) to squash the rumor mill: "The Magic Multiverse has its own school of Magic at Strixhaven with plenty of secrets still to explore," the post reads. "Our Universes Beyond roadmap currently doesn't have us visiting any others."

After the upcoming [_Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_](https://www.polygon.com/mtg-tmnt-spoilers-cards-magic-the-gathering-commander-precon/) Universes Beyond set slated for a March 6 release, the next _Magic_ set is _Secrets of Strixhaven_ due out on April 24, which focuses on the magical university located on the plane of Arcavios. So it stands to reason that Wizards wouldn't want anything related to The Boy Who Lived to overshadow _Magic_'s own school of witchcraft and wizardry. (Even if Strixhaven entering the Tri-Wizard Tournament sounds pretty rad.)

To be fair, the lines blur quite a bit when it comes to collaborations between Hasbro, Wizards, and other companies and brands. A few hours after the Harry Potter partnership was announced, Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks discussed it moments before delving into _Magic_'s ongoing success. One particular slide in the presentation to investors put Harry Potter side-by-side with posters of the _K-Pop Demon Hunters_, _Street Fighter_, and _Voltron_ movies.

Earlier this February, Hasbro [announced](https://newsroom.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hasbro-and-legendary-entertainment-enter-ring-epic-street) a toy collaboration with Legendary Entertainment for the new _Street Fighter_ movie, a franchise that's already seen Secret Lair Drops in the past. Hasbro also [announced](https://www.polygon.com/kpop-demon-hunters-toys-hasbro/) the toy licensing deal for _K-Pop Demon Hunters_ back in October 2025. Days later, Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks [confirmed](https://icv2.com/articles/news/view/60865/magic-the-gathering-growth-accelerated-q3) during the 2025 Q3 earnings call that Wizards would put out a _K-Pop Demon Hunters_ Secret Lair Drop sometime in 2026. September 2025 also saw the announcement of a broader Play-Doh collaboration — which led to a [Secret Lair Drop](https://www.polygon.com/mtg-secret-lair-extra-life-play-doh-cards-magic-the-gathering/) weeks later. Assuming Harry Potter might also wind up in _Magic_ really isn't that great a leap of faith to take considering the history here.

Particularly now that the brand is squarely within the wider Hasbro ecosystem, Harry Potter UB is definitely more possible than it was yesterday. The franchise is also just naturally a good fit with its wizards, goblins, wands, dragons, and other fantasy staples — especially compared to some other upcoming crossovers.

Despite Wizards’ statement, the speculation itself speaks to how blurred the boundaries between Hasbro’s brands have become. With _Marvel Super Heroes_, _The Hobbit_, and _Star Trek_ sets all due out this year, anything and everything feels possible for _Magic_ these days. As the company continues to roll out toy, film, and game partnerships that increasingly intersect with _Magic_ — which remains the company's most profitable business arm — it’s easy to see why fans assume Harry Potter could still eventually follow the same path. For now, Strixhaven is the only wizarding school _Magic_ fans will visit in the near future.
