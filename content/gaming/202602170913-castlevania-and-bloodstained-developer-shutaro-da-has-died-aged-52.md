Veteran game developer Shutaro Īda has died aged 52 following a battle with pancreatic cancer.

Īda's family shared the news on [social media](https://x.com/CurryHermit/status/2023200658544083439), noting that he passed away on February 10.

"We deeply appreciate the kindness shown to him during his lifetime and respectfully announce his passing," they wrote. "Shutaro's adventure in this world has ended, but his work lives on. We sincerely hope you will continue to enjoy the games he created."

Known for his work on the Castlevania and Bloodstained series, Īda started his career in games at Konami in 1996. He worked at the developer for almost two decades, joining the Castlevania franchise in the early 2000s as a programmer.

Īda also worked on Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes and Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain.

He later joined Castlevania series producer Koji Igarashi at indie studio ArtPlay. They worked together on Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, where Ida served as designer and game director. Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement is set to release this year.

"We had worked together since Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow. It is no exaggeration to say that many titles hailed as masterpieces would not have been possible without his contributions. His talent was truly exceptional," Igarashi wrote on [social media](https://x.com/KojiIGA/status/2023210325970129391).

"Looking back, he supported me for over 20 years. He was someone who constantly thought about games, approaching development with a passion that burned like a flame."

Igarashi continued: "In September 2024, we learned he had terminal cancer. The news was a tremendous shock. The nearly year-and-a-half battle that followed must have been unimaginably gruelling. His passing is profoundly saddening, though knowing he is now free from suffering brings a sense of relief. Having run at full speed for so long, I hope he can finally rest peacefully now.

“The game he was working on, Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement, is currently in development. It is a precious work imbued with his spirit. We will carry on his vision and see it through to completion, so he won’t be disappointed. We ask for your continued support and encouragement, now more than ever. Our thoughts are with his family, and we pray for his eternal rest."
