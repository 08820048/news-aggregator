If you've been hesitating to get into [_One Piece_](https://www.polygon.com/tag/one-piece/), the best-selling hit manga from Eiichiro Oda with over 1,150 chapters, there's no better time than now. To celebrate the upcoming release of [season 2 of Netflix's _One Piece_](https://www.polygon.com/netflix-one-piece-season-2-release-date-live-action/), Viz Media and Shonen Jump are making the first 155 chapters of the series available for free on [the Shonen Jump app](https://www.viz.com/) until April 10.

It's just one tenth of Eiichiro Oda's epic tale, but it's enough to get a taste of the adventures of Luffy and the Straw Hat Pirates. These early chapters cover the story adapted in the first two seasons of the Netflix show, showing the Straw Hats' journey in the East Blue sea and the dangerous Grand Line, all the way until their arrival in the Alabasta Kingdom, where they will face the dangerous organization known as Baroque Works. This showdown and the exciting Alabasta Arc will be adapted in [season 3 of the live-action show](https://www.polygon.com/netflix-one-piece-season-3-confirmed/), so there's no risk of spoilers if you are a fan of Netflix's _One Piece_.

While One Piece is one of the most popular franchises in the world, getting into it can be intimidating. With thousands of chapters and anime episodes, new fans often struggle to approach the series, but once they do, they rarely turn back. The Netflix show is not a substitute for the manga or anime, as it takes many liberties with the story, but it did a great job in becoming a new gateway for the franchise. [Season 2 will be bigger and better](https://www.polygon.com/netflix-one-piece-season-2-trailer-baroque-works/) under any conceivable metric, showing the Grand Line in all its bizarre awesomeness, including giants, dinosaurs, ship-swallowing whales, and the strongest foes that Luffy and friends have faced until now.

Season 2 of Netflix's _One Piece_ debuts on March 10. Meanwhile, you can unlock chapters 1-155 of the _One Piece_ manga until April 10 on the Shonen Jump app, available in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, the Philippines, Singapore, and India. Outside these countries, _One Piece_ is available on Manga Plus, where you can read hundreds of chapters for free, but only once.
