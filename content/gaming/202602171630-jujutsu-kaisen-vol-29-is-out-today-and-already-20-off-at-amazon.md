### Jujutsu Kaisen, Vol. 29

This new volume has really climbed the Amazon charts today as well. It's currently sitting at number three on the [Amazon Best Sellers list of comics and graphic novels](https://www.amazon.com/best-sellers-books-Amazon/zgbs/books/4366/ref=zg_bs_pg_1_books?_encoding=UTF8&pg=1), just ahead of the Game of Thrones prequel graphic novel, The Hedge Knight, and Absolute Batman Vol. 1 and 2. That's mighty impressive. What better time to scoop it up and ride the wave of excitement on its first day of release?

Alongside the release of Jujutsu Kaisen's Vol. 29, there's also season three of the Jujutsu Kaisen anime for fans to dig into this year. In our [review of Season 3 Part 1, Episodes 1 and 2](https://www.ign.com/articles/jujutsu-kaisen-season-3-part-1-episodes-1-2-review) from earlier in January, IGN's Leanne Butkovic said, "The Culling Game kicks off as confidently as JJK has ever been with impressively dynamic fight scenes and bold cinematic choices that continue to set the series apart from a typical shonen anime."

If you're curious when you'll be able to catch new episodes from season three, have a look at our breakdown of [when to expect new episodes of The Culling Games Part 1](https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-watch-jujutsu-kaisen-season-3-episode-release-dates) to start planning ahead.
