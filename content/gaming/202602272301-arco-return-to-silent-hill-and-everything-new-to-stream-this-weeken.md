This week on streaming brings action and adventure across time and space. For the first time, you can rent the Best Animated Feature Oscar nominee [_Arco_](https://www.polygon.com/arco-movie-utopias/), a time-travel story from [French illustrator Ugo Bienvenu](https://www.polygon.com/arco-featurette-2015-music-video-jabberwocky/), which moves between a dark vision of 2075 and an idyllic 29th century. On Hulu, _In the Blink of an Eye_ explores human nature _Cloud Atlas_ style, jumping between story threads about a Neanderthal family, a present-day romance, and a future space mission where Kate McKinnon tries to launch a new home for humanity on a distant planet.

[_The Bluff_](https://www.polygon.com/the-bluff-review-pirates-priyanka-chopra-jonas-john-wick/), a hybrid between _[John Wick](https://www.polygon.com/2019/5/16/18564505/john-wick-3-interview-writer-origin-story-explained/)_ and a [Pirates of the Caribbean](https://www.polygon.com/2020/8/6/21352601/pirates-of-the-caribbean-ultimate-girlhood-fantasy/) movie, has sailed onto Prime Video. Pyramid Head haunts a twisted, deserted town in [_Return to Silent Hill_](https://www.polygon.com/return-to-silent-hill-destroys-three-characters-angela/), Christophe Gans’ adaptation of _Silent Hill 2_, which arrives on VOD.

Here's a rundown of the most notable new releases on streaming and VOD, including the biggest, best, and most popular new movies you can watch at home right now.

## New on Hulu

### In the Blink of an Eye

-   **Genre:** Science fiction
-   **Run time:** 1h 34m
-   **Director:** Andrew Stanton
-   **Cast:** Rashida Jones, Kate McKinnon, Daveed Diggs

An ambitious drama from [_WALL-E_](https://www.polygon.com/23343003/wall-e-pixar-disney-criterion-collection/) and [_Finding Nemo_](https://www.polygon.com/2013/10/3/4798702/pixars-finding-nemo-recreated-as-an-8-bit-game/) director Andrew Stanton, _In the Blink of an Eye_ covers all of human history in less than two hours. The story connects the experiences of Claire (Rashida Jones), an anthropology professor studying Neanderthals, with the lives of a prehistoric family, and a space mission to a new home for humanity.

## New on Prime Video

### The Bluff

-   **Genre:** Action thriller
-   **Run time:** 1h 41m
-   **Director:** Frank E. Flowers
-   **Cast:** Priyanka Chopra, Karl Urban, Ismael Cruz Córdova

The ruthless pirate Ercell Bodden (Priyanka Chopra Jonas) has settled down and started a family in the late 19th-century Caribbean. But when pirate captain (Karl Urban) brings his search for stolen gold to her doorstep, Ercell has to unleash a John Wick level of violence to fight for her loved ones, in this film that feels like a lost Pirates of the Caribbean spin-off.

From our [review](https://www.polygon.com/the-bluff-review-pirates-priyanka-chopra-jonas-john-wick/):

> What’s missing is a greater sense of purpose, whether that would be high-flying adventure or a stronger sense of elegiac loneliness in the lives of post-peak pirates. Instead, the filmmakers can’t resist turning Ercell into a highly contemporary (and very actor-flattering) noble badass, one who can dispatch plenty of bad guys with quick-thinking agility, and gets righteously feral whenever her family is threatened.

## New on Shudder

### Crazy Old Lady

-   **Genre:** Psychological horror
-   **Run time:** 1h 34m
-   **Director:** Martín Mauregui
-   **Cast:** Carmen Maura, Daniel Hendler, Agustina Liendo

Pedro (Daniel Hendler) tries to help his ex-girlfriend take care of her mother, Alicia (Carmen Maura), who is living with dementia.

## New to rent

### [Arco](https://amzn.to/4aJ5iJG)

-   **Genre:** Science fantasy
-   **Run time:** 1h 29m
-   **Director:** Ugo Bienvenu
-   **Cast:** Juliano Krue Valdi, Mark Ruffalo, Romy Fay

Arco (Juliano Krue Valdi), a 10-year-old from a peaceful distant future, steals a time-travel device and accidentally winds up in 2075. Stuck in a world where most people rely on robots to raise their children and fires are constantly raging, Arco befriends a lonely girl (Romy Fay) and gives her hope that things can get better.

From our [review](https://www.polygon.com/arco-review-oscar-nominated-best-animated-feature/):

> Bienvenu’s sense of whimsy uses 2D animation to its fullest potential, especially in the time-travel sequences. Not only is the use of a crystal-powered leotard far different than any other means of time travel we’ve seen before, when a time traveler really gets going, they’re usually represented by what looks like a shooting star followed by a rainbow streak. It’s a simple effect that conveys a real sense of wonder.

### Bring the Law

### [In Cold Light](https://amzn.to/4s6kMOT)
