Amazon has launched a ['Buy 2, get 1 50% off' sale](https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-has-a-buy-1-get-1-half-price-sale-on-4k-blu-ray-movies-board-games-february-2026) ahead of Valentine's Day, and it's filled to the brim with 4K movies. These promotions are always a great time to pick up a sweet little movie gift for yourself or your loved ones, and this version of the sale has particularly great options [for the Disney fan in your life](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-disney-gifts-for-adults).

There are a bunch of [4K Disney and Pixar movies](https://www.ign.com/articles/all-animated-disney-and-pixar-movies-in-4k) eligible for the deal, including some of the newest releases. I've rounded up the full list of Disney offerings here, but you can also mix and match these movies with any other inclusions in the sale and still receive the special discount. There's a healthy mix of [books](https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-bogo-book-sale-february-2026), Blu-rays, [anime](https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-buy-1-get-1-50-off-sale-anime-cartoon-blu-ray-deals), and even board games to choose from.

## Buy 1, Get 1 Half Off 4K Disney Movies

Although this list of eligible Disney movies in this sale is pretty Pixar heavy, there are still a few animated gems in here. The Emperor's New Groove and Lilo & Stitch were both released in 4K just last year, and are already discounted _and_ eligible for the additional 50% off. The Emperor's New Groove just celebrated its 25th anniversary with that 4K release and it's absolutely worth picking up for your collection if you don't already have it. The original animated Lilo & Stitch also got a 4K release in 2025 alongside the [live-action remake](https://www.ign.com/articles/lilo-stitch-remake-review) of the film.

If you're a fan of Pixar, there's a lot more to choose from in this sale. I'd personally recommend grabbing Rattatouille in 4K, partially because it's one of my favorites, but also because it was released back in 2019 and is the most likely to go out of print before it gets a 25th anniversary edition in 2032. You can also snap up the Elio 4K steelbook, which is a limited edition and won't be around forever.
