After you get a fresh new fit in [_Heartopia_](https://www.polygon.com/heartopia/), you may want to **change your hairstyle** to match. There are a few ways to do this, but mainly you'll just want to use a mirror furnishing item in your home. However, if you don't have a mirror, there is still a way you can change your hairstyle.

Below we explain **how to change your hairstyle in** _**Heartopia.**_

## How to change your hairstyle in Heartopia

To change your hair, you can **interact with any mirror furniture** you have inside your house. This will give you access to some of the hairstyles available when first making your character, as well as let you change other features, like your skin tone, eyebrows, eyes, and facial hair. **You can also use mirrors in other people's houses**.

If you don't have a mirror yet or you don't want to seem like a lurking weirdo in somebody else's house, you can go **upstairs Dorothee's clothing shop and interact with the mirrors on the wall**. Here, you'll be able to change your hair to any of your unlocked styles, or you can **buy more hairstyles**, some of which cost gold, and others cost Wishing Stars. Additionally, you can also "try on" the hairstyles that you'd usually only be able to unlock from the Gilded Acorn Expedition (gacha), to see what they look like before you spend your premium currency on them.

Notably, there are lots of gacha-based hairstyles that don't let you freely change the colors. For example, the Forestbell Spell hair is only available in certain pastel colors, so if you want a darker twintail style, you may need to wait for a future update.
