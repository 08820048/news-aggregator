Thanks to a new unadvertised coupon code that just went live for Presidents Day, Lenovo is offering a solid deal on a mid-range gaming PC. The [Lenovo Legion Tower 5 Gen 10 gaming PC](https://zdcs.link/QqJkR7?object_uuid=840deeb2-ee6e-43fd-9d63-ac1ad50c5642&t=article) equipped with a GeForce RTX 5070 GPU drops to just $1,574.99 after you apply coupon code "**PDLIVE26**". Free delivery is included. The RTX 5070 graphics card is an excellent choice for gaming at up to 1440p, although it also has the chops to run many games in 4K.

## Lenovo Legion Tower 5 RTX 5070 Gaming PC for $1575

[![Lenovo Legion Tower 5 Gen 10 Intel Core Ultra 7 265F RTX 5070 Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/29/lenovolegion5gen102-1756487528476.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/QqJkR7?object_uuid=840deeb2-ee6e-43fd-9d63-ac1ad50c5642&t=article "Lenovo Legion Tower 5 Gen 10 Intel Core Ultra 7 265F RTX 5070 Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)")

### Lenovo Legion Tower 5 Gen 10 Intel Core Ultra 7 265F RTX 5070 Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)

The Lenovo Legion Tower 5 Gen 10 gaming PC is equipped with an Intel Core Ultra 7 265F CPU, GeForce RTX 5070 12GB GPU, 32GB of DDR5-5600MHz RAM, and a 2TB M.2 SSD. The Intel Core Ultra 7 265F is a 20-core processor with a max turbo frequency of 5.3GHz. Rare for a Legion Tower 5 system, the CPU is cooled by a 240mm all-in-one liquid cooler.

A total of six 120mm RGB fans and a sensibly designed 30L midtower chassis keeps your components quiet and cool. An 850W 80PLUS Gold power supply provides plenty of power. The case offers toolless entry and most of the components are non-proprietary, so they are easy to swap out or upgrade yourself down the road.

### The GeForce RTX 5070 GPU is an excellent choice for 1080p or 1440p gaming

Compared to the previous generation GPUs, the RTX 5070 offers a slight performance improvement over the RTX 4070 Super, which was and still is an excellent GPU. The fps gain is greater in games that support [DLSS 4.5](https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidias-dlss-45-is-here-with-better-image-quality-now-and-6x-multi-frame-generation-coming-soon) with multi-frame gen, which is common for any new release game that doesn't have some special agreement with AMD (and even then, the support usually comes in the form of a patch later).

This is the best Nvidia RTX 5000 series GPU for up to 1440 gaming without overspending. That said, it is also fully capable of running non-demanding games at 4K resolution as well. The next card up - the RTX 5070 Ti - is practically impossible to find as a standalone card at MSRP, and an RTX 5070 Ti prebuilt will run you $2,000 ([except during Presidents Day](https://www.ign.com/articles/lenovo-presidents-sale-best-deals-on-legion-rtx-5070-ti-and-rtx-5080-gaming-pcs)).
