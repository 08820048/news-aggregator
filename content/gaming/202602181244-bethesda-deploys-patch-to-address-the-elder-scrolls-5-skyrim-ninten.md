Bethesda has issued a new patch to address issues plaguing The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's Nintendo Switch 2 port.

Bethesda shadowdropped the [The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Anniversary Edition](https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition) for Switch 2 [last December](https://www.ign.com/articles/its-a-bit-of-a-joke-at-this-point-how-often-we-release-skyrim-but-its-a-great-game-bethesda-sees-funny-side-after-shadowdropping-nintendo-switch-2-port). However, just a day after [Bethesda announced and launched The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim on Nintendo Switch 2](https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-found-another-platform-to-release-skyrim-on-nintendo-switch-2-and-its-out-today), fans reported that the game had arrived with notable performance issues. There were widespread complaints about input lag and the locked 30 frames per second visuals. And there has been criticism, too, of the fact the game hogs 53GB of space on the Switch 2's relatively limited internal memory, compared to just 25GB on PC.

Update 1.2 addresses many of the complaints players have raised over the last couple of months, including adding a new 60 Hz mode, improved FPS performance, fixed "visual issues," and more. Here's the full list.

## **Skyrim Switch 2 Update 1.2 patch notes:**

**Features:**

-   Added a 60 Hz mode under Display settings that allows players to toggle between “Prioritize Visuals” or “Prioritize Performance”.
-   In addition, frame rate has been locked at 30 Hz in “Prioritize Visuals” mode for smoother gameplay.

**Crashes and Performance Fixes:**

-   Fixed a crash that occurred when reading “The Crimson Dirks Vol. 4” book for the “Tilted Scales” quest in German.
-   Fixed an audio-related crash.
-   Fixed a crash, infinite load, and game freeze that sometimes occurred when rapidly selecting “Load” multiple times in the pause menu.
-   Fixed a crash that occurred when the “Transmute Ore” spell was repeatedly cast outside of the Haltered Stream Camp.

**Improved FPS performance drops that occurred in the following locations**:

-   during the Hide and Seek quest in Kynesgrove
-   during combat at Secunda’s Kiss
-   when discovering the “Drelas’ Cottage” location
-   when engaged in combat with a giant at the Talking Stone Camp.

**Visuals Issues Fixes:**

-   Viewing water planes from a distance or within menus caused them to shift up and down.
-   Distant aspen trees appeared with a blue tint.
-   Transitioning out of caves caused an outline of the entrance to linger during the fade-to-back loading screen.

**User Interface Fixes:**

-   Switching between mouse and controller mode while in dialogue or the Help menu, caused different options to be highlighted.
-   Switching between mouse and controller mode while in help menus or user hints, did not dynamically update callout prompts.
-   The “Ready/Sheathe” option was missing from the Joy-Con 2 Mouse Controls menu.
-   The “Delete” prompt remained grayed-out within the Load menu when swapping between mouse and controller mode.
-   Deleting a save in the Save/Load menus reset the highlighted selection to the top of the menu list.
-   While in mouse mode, the cursor remained stuck within a smaller section of the screen when changing between docked/undocked modes or interfacing with GameChat.

**Controls Fixes**:

-   The “Eagle Eye” Archery perk remained active after switching between mouse and controller mode.
-   Holding down the Right Joystick while reassigning a button caused that button to disappear from the Controls list.
-   The Joy-Con 2 controllers provided haptic feedback while in mouse mode.
-   Buttons became unresponsive when controls were remapped while moving the Joy-Con 2 controllers in mouse mode.
-   Rotating the map in mouse mode was slower and less smooth than in controller mode.

**Audio Issue Fix**:

-   Scrolling SFX continued to play while holding up or down on the Left Joystick or buttons at the top or bottom of the Save/Load menus.

**Localization Fixes**:

-   “Amiibo” appeared as plural in Spanish.

**Miscellaneous**:

-   Added new translations for the features listed above and UI updates.
-   Updates were made to the game credits.
