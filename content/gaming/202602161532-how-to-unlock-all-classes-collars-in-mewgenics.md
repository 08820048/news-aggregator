There are 13 _[Mewgenics](https://www.polygon.com/game/mew-genics/3325/)_ **classes** in this cat breeding turn-based roguelike, although you'll only start the game with four. Knowing how each of the classes works, alongside what the best ones are and how to unlock them in the first place, is key to progressing through this incredibly deep and layered game from the creator of _The Binding of Isaac_.

So whether you've just started the game and you want to know what's coming up for you or you want to know how to unlock a specific one, here are the details for the different **_Mewgenics_** **classes**.

**Update (Feb. 16)**: We've updated this guide with information about two more classes, as well as some context about Blank Collars.

## Mewgenics classes and how to unlock them

Classes in _Mewgenics_ are represented by collars, which you'll select at the beginning of each run. As you defeat bosses in new areas, you'll unlock more collars to use from Butch. Keep playing through each available path, and eventually you'll have them all, but note that it will take a while before you can nab those late-game classes.

Notably, you can also use Blank Collars to have multiple copies of one class on your team. Blank Collars are, well, collars, but aren't classes, so if you want more information about those, you can check out our [Blank Collar guide](https://www.polygon.com/mewgenics-blank-collars-explained-how-to-get-use/).

Below we list the 13 _Mewgenics_ classes, their stats, and how to unlock them.
