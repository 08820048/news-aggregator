The [Dell Presidents Day Sale](https://zdcs.link/a07xxl?object_uuid=4f0967ef-8a94-42e9-a569-31e132947206&t=article) offically kicks off this week. Traditionally, this has been Dell's best sale during the early part of the year to score a big discount on both Alienware gaming PCs and laptops. Prices on prebuilts have risen in 2026 because of the increased demand for RAM and GPUs, so if you're looking to upgrade now, you don't want to miss this opportunity to get a new system without an egregious markup. All systems ship free and include a one year warranty. I will continue to add to this article as more deals go live closer to President's Day weekend.

## Alienware Area-51 RTX 5090 Gaming PC From $4,300

[![Alienware Area-51 AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D RTX 5090 Gaming PC (32GB/1TB)](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/05/alienwarearea51ryzen-1767655287373.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/Qm8lw6?object_uuid=4f0967ef-8a94-42e9-a569-31e132947206&t=article "Alienware Area-51 AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D RTX 5090 Gaming PC (32GB/1TB)")

### Alienware Area-51 AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D RTX 5090 Gaming PC (32GB/1TB)

[![Alienware Area-51 Intel Core Ultra 7 265 RTX 5090 Gaming PC (32GB/1TB)](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/30/alienwarearea51pc-1738253051085.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/z7RL3L?object_uuid=4f0967ef-8a94-42e9-a569-31e132947206&t=article "Alienware Area-51 Intel Core Ultra 7 265 RTX 5090 Gaming PC (32GB/1TB)")

### Alienware Area-51 Intel Core Ultra 7 265 RTX 5090 Gaming PC (32GB/1TB)

Alienware's only RTX 5090 equipped gaming PC sees its biggest discount of the year. The Alienware Area-51 [Intel Edition](https://zdcs.link/z7RL3L?object_uuid=4f0967ef-8a94-42e9-a569-31e132947206&t=article) RTX 5090 gaming PC starts at just $4,299.99 after an $1,150 discount. Arguably an even better deal is the Alienware Area-51 [AMD Ryzen X3D Edition](https://zdcs.link/Qm8lw6?object_uuid=4f0967ef-8a94-42e9-a569-31e132947206&t=article) RTX 5090 gaming PC, which drops to $4,449.99.

These are the best deals I've seen for an Area-51 RTX 5090 desktop and beats out 2025 pricing, despite the fact that RAM and GPU prices are on the rise. In fact, as of today, these are the lowest prices for an RTX 5090 prebuilt across all brands and retailers. Once these deals expire, they probably won't resurface for several months.
