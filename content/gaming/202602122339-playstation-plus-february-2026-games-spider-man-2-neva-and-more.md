Sony has revealed the lineup of new games joining its PlayStation Plus Game Catalog in February, continuing a [recent string of must-play additions](https://www.polygon.com/playstation-plus-game-catalog-january-2026-resident-evil-village/) to the subscription service. The best Spider-Man game yet, a tear-jerking indie, and more are set to join the service on Feb. 17 for Premium and Extra subscribers, Sony revealed in a [PlayStation Blog post](https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-february-marvels-spider-man-2-test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-neva-season-a-letter-to-the-future-and-more/).

_Marvel's Spider-Man 2_ continues Peter and Miles' Spider-Man journeys from the first game and the _Miles Morales_ spin-off. They both patrol New York City — expanded to now include parts of Queens and Brooklyn — and, for the most part, you can swap between them at will. [Miles's electric Venom powers](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Miles_Morales_\(Earth-1610\)#Powers) (not that Venom) make him stand apart from Peter's classic arsenal, which gets its own upgrade when he [bonds with the game's symbiote](https://www.polygon.com/23939389/spider-man-2-voice-actor-yuri-lowenthal-venom-ai-union-strike/). _Spider-Man 2_'s story remixes classic Spider-Man canon, including who becomes Venom (_now_ the Venom you're thinking of). It's an excellent [open-world adventure](https://www.polygon.com/spider-man-2-ps5-open-world-game/), with [Polygon's review](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23910756/spider-man-2-review-insomniac-release-date-ps5/) saying "it plays like a dream, with smart additions to combat that enhance the power fantasy of being Spider-Man."

If you're a Spider-Man fan invested in the PlayStation ecosystem, there's a chance you've already played _Marvel's Spider-Man 2_ (it's sold [over 11 million copies](https://gamerant.com/marvels-spider-man-2-11-million-sales-so-far/) as of May 2024). But, odds are you haven't played the other headliner for the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog, _Neva_. It's a heart-breaking 2D platformer from Nomada Studio, the developer of the equally emotional [_Gris_](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2018/11/8/18069254/gris-review-switch-pc-devolver-digital/). In _Neva_, you play as a young woman accompanied by her wolf-like companion as they travel across a corrupted world throughout the seasons. Polygon called it "devastatingly beautiful" in [our review](https://www.polygon.com/review/465091/neva-review-nomada-devolver-digital/).

_Marvel's Spider-Man 2_ and _Neva_ are joined by a few more additions to the Game Catalog for February. Here's everything else arriving:

-   _Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown_
-   _Season: A Letter to the Future_
-   _Monster Hunter Stories_
-   _Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin_
-   _Venba_
-   _Echoes of the End: Enhanced Edition_
-   _Rugby 25_
-   _Disney Pixar Wall-E_ (Premium only)

PlayStation Plus's Game Catalog of PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 games is available to those who subscribe to its higher tiers, above Essentials. It's Sony's answer to Xbox Game Pass, offering hundreds of games for subscribers to download and check out.
