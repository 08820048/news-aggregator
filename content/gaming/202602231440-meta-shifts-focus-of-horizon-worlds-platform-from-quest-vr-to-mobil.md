Meta is "shifting the focus" of its Horizon Worlds metaverse platform to be "almost exclusively mobile."

In a [blog post,](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/blog/2026-vr-state-of-the-union-horizon-mobile-focus/) Reality Labs VP of content Samantha Ryan said the firm needed to focus on developing Horizon Worlds for mobile to "tap into a much larger market."

"We're explicitly separating our Quest VR platform from our Worlds platform in order to create more space for both products to grow," wrote Ryan. "We're doubling down on the VR developer ecosystem while shifting the focus of Worlds to be almost exclusively mobile."

Ryan continued: "We started Worlds for VR with a small crew of dedicated creators who set out to build immersive experiences on their own. Last year, we began to experiment with Worlds as a mobile platform, and we saw positive momentum. Now, to truly change the game and tap into a much larger market, we're going all-in on mobile."

As for VR software, Meta is "focused on supporting the third-party developer community and sustaining our VR investment over the long term."

"While we're proud of the world-class work from Oculus Studios over the years, among 1P and 3P apps, 86% of the effective time people spend in their VR headsets is with third-party apps," wrote Ryan.

"We'll continue to support the third-party community through strategic partnerships and targeted investments – as we have since the beginning."

In its [latest financial report](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/metas-reality-labs-division-generated-22bn-lost-192bn-in-fy25), Meta's Reality Labs division generated $2.2 billion in revenue in 2025 and reported a $19.2 billion loss.

Last month, [Meta laid off 10% of its Reality Labs division](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/meta-reportedly-set-to-cut-10-of-staff-in-reality-labs-metaverse-arm). Shortly after, [it closed three VR studios:](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/meta-closes-three-vr-studios-following-10-cut-to-reality-labs-metaverse-division) Twisted Pixel Games (Marvel's Deadpool VR), Sanzaru Games (Asgard's Wrath), and Armature Studio (Resident Evil VR port).
