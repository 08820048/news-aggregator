While there’s an endless spread of romantic movies out there, including quite a few films from the Disney slate, Valentine’s Day is also a go-to subject for TV specials. Back in the day, Disney Channel series were pretty much expected to have a Valentine’s Day episode in some form or another, and plenty of these episodes quickly became fan favorites for either the romance or, in some cases, the absurdity.

If you’re already worn out on rom-coms and are still looking for a cozy activity to enjoy this weekend, I highly recommend taking a trip down memory lane with some old-school Valentine’s Day episodes on Disney+.

## If You're Looking for Classic Disney Channel:

The classic [Disney Channel slate](https://www.ign.com/tv/publisher/disney-channel) from the 2000s is most likely where you’ll get some serious hits of nostalgia. Lizzie McGuire, which [almost got a reboot](https://www.ign.com/articles/lizzie-mcguire-disney-plus-shelved-reboot-plot-revealed-hilary-duff), actually kicked off its second season with a Valentine’s episode, which sees Lizzie get a tad bit obsessed with the local paperboy. A That's So Raven episode features Raven trying to set up her brother, Cory (of later ['in the House' fame](https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-ds-disney-tie-in-looks-set-to-dethrone-clair-obscur-expedition-33-as-metacritics-best-user-rated-game-of-all-time)), after getting a premonition he’d be alone on Valentine’s Day.

And while not necessarily tied specifically to Valentine’s Day episode, the two parts of Hannah Montana's "Achey Jakey Heart" are a pretty beloved set of episodes that we’re going to call close enough. Especially given the series is celebrating its [20th anniversary this year](https://www.ign.com/articles/whats-new-on-disney-plus-february-2026).

## Or the Animated Side:

A surprising amount of old-school Disney cartoons featured romance and Valentine’s Day-specific episodes. While the (animated) Kim Possible movie does have some solid Kim and Ron moments, the Valentine’s Day episode from the series actually focused on Wade and Monique. One of my personal childhood favorites, Recess, had an entire episode dedicated to T.J. handing out terrible Valentine’s cards. Some of these episodes aged better than others.

On the more recent end of things, [Gravity Falls](https://www.ign.com/tv/gravity-falls) once again doesn’t cite the holiday by name, but Mabel taking her matchmaking tendencies to the extreme in the Season 2 episode “The Love God” became a staple of the Disney Channel's Valentine’s Day marathons.

## Of Course, Lots of The Simpsons

[![So Many Valentine's Day Episodes](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/12/simpsons-1770916933959.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/aB8ZDN?object_uuid=082abce8-a0b0-4c1b-b405-9c64d97ab159&t=article "So Many Valentine's Day Episodes")

The Simpsons

### So Many Valentine's Day Episodes

Disney+ is the streaming home for [all of The Simpsons episodes](https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-reveals-247-simpsons-stream-with-nearly-entire-show-to-binge-watch), and this is one animated show that never misses an opportunity for a seasonal special. While there hasn’t been a Valentine’s Day-specific episode every single season, there’s still a solid spread over the series’ lifespan that could make for a quirkier Valentine’s Day marathon.

Some particular highlights that made it into our list of [the best Simpsons episodes](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-top-36-best-simpsons-episodes) are Season 4's "I Love Lisa," Season 10's "I'm with Cupid," and Season 23's "The Daughter Also Rises."

## Beyond the Disney Umbrella

If you happen to subscribe to one of [Disney+'s many bundles](https://www.ign.com/wikis/disney-plus/Plans_and_Pricing), you'll also have access to the Hulu side of things. This is where you'll find sitcoms for days. New Girl has a particularly strong sequence of Valentine’s episodes (including _the_ ["Valentine's Day" episode](https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/02/15/new-girl-valentines-day-review)), but there’s plenty more options from across eras, including The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Modern Family, and Will & Grace.

If you were part of the Gleek generation, this is where you’ll find the iconic ["Silly Love Songs" episode](https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/02/09/glee-silly-love-songs-review). It’s also where you’ll get Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which happens to be [next up on the reboot menu](https://www.ign.com/articles/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-reboot-not-just-revisiting-the-past-but-will-honor-shows-original-dna-sarah-michelle-gellar-says). Of all the romances in that show, the Valentine's Day episode focuses on Cordelia and Xander. Again, some of these aged better than others.

While these are some of the episodes I have the strongest memories of from my childhood, I can’t guarantee we were all given the same TV schedules. It’s a fun journey to rediscover media that was important to you, personally, and potentially even more fun (perhaps even romantic) to share that journey with someone else. Wink wink.
