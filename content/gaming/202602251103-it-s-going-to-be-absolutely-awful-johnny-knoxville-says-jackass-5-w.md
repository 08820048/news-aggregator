Jackass star Johnny Knoxville has said that the franchise's upcoming fifth film will be its final installment — and this time, it sounds like he really means it.

Due for release this summer, Jackass 5 will reunite the series' core surviving cast for one last compilation of pain-inducing stunts and silly pranks. [Even Bam Margera is set to appear](https://www.ign.com/articles/jackass-5-will-welcome-back-bam-margera-albeit-via-previously-unseen-archive-footage), albeit via never-before-seen archive footage.

And this time, it seems, the Jackass crew really are ready to ride off into the sunset — years after [Jackass Forever](https://www.ign.com/movies/jackass-forever) seemed set to serve as its own swansong.

"This is the natural place to end," Knoxville, now 54, said in an interview with [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/johnny-knoxville-jackass-5-interview-1235514191/). "So it's going to be absolutely awful.

"You hope it doesn't go well at all!" he joked. "Should be a f\*cking train wreck. That's what you should hope for. I think we designed it that way."

But is this really the end? In a [GQ](https://www.gq.com/story/johnny-knoxvilles-last-rodeo) interview conducted back in 2021, Knoxville said Jackass Forever would be his "last contribution to the franchise," only to subsequently be tempted back once again. As part of the same interview, however, co-star Steve-O declared that "every movie that we ever made was the f\*\*\*ing last one. And not just the last one, but declared as the last one."

Indeed, [IGN’s Jackass Forever review](https://www.ign.com/articles/jackass-forever-review) dubbed the movie as the "final chapter in American comedy’s most chaotic saga," and declared it "a hilarious last hurrah for its original crew."

All of which was correct up until last month, when Knoxville surprised fans by announcing Jackass 5, for launch this summer. "Well a wang dang and hot damn doodle, we are starting the year off with a bang,” wrote Knoxville on Instagram. "We wanted to let you know that this summer Jackass is back! We will see you in theatres June 26th."
