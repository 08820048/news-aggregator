PlayStation’s Direct store is in the middle of a [major sale on PS5 games](https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-launches-a-brand-new-promotional-sale-on-ps5-games-accessories-and-more), accessories, and aside from some fantastic deals on [limited-edition controllers and collector’s editions](https://www.ign.com/articles/save-on-death-stranding-2s-limited-edition-dualsense-and-the-amazing-collectors-edition), there’s an accessory you may not have considered.

The humble PS5 face plate, designed to help your console stand out or fit more stylishly in your home setup, is reduced - with options like the ever-popular Midnight Black down to just $39 - [a discount of 28%](https://zdcs.link/9wBGmq?object_uuid=6c74fa0c-6649-45ff-b8f8-0861eeab15ad&t=article).

Aside from that sleek Black variant, you can grab the Cobalt Blue face plate for $44, down from $59. One for the Sonic the Hedgehog fans, perhaps.

Looking for something striking? One of the red variants, specifically Volcanic Red, is discounted to $44, too.

More subtle is Chroma Pearl. At first glance, it looks like the standard white color, but look a tad closer, and you’ll see a subtle pearlescent touch in the light.

As a reminder, these face plates are for the Slim PS5 model, so they won’t work on launch PS5 systems, which is a shame.

There are other options that aren’t discounted, too. Remix Green looks like you could use it to avoid a hazard on the road, while Techno Red is how we imagine former WWE superstar Kane sets up his PS5.

Finally, Rhythm Blue offers a similar two-tone look, but with a softer blue than the Cobalt version mentioned earlier.
