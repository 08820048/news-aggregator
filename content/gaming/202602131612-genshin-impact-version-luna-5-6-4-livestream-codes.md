Hoyoverse just wrapped up the [_Genshin Impact_](https://www.polygon.com/game/genshin-impact/40711) version "Luna 5" (or 6.4) preview livestream, showing off all sorts of details about the upcoming patch. Most importantly, there were several codes that award Primogems and other rewards shown during the stream. Our **_Genshin Impact_ 6.4 livestream code** list provides you with the three stream codes for rewards and explains how to redeem them.

Varka, the Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius, is finally making his playable debut this patch. The Ameno Claymore user will be available this patch for players to pull in the limited banner, to coincide with a return to Mondstadt for some story involving Andrius (the original wolf world boss). The flagship event for this patch is "Homeward, He Who Caught the Wind," which will reward a catalyst weapon skin, "Phantasmal Gift: Star Omen."
