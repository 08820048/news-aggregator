Asha Sharma has "no tolerance for bad AI" as she takes on the role of Microsoft Gaming CEO and EVP.

Speaking to [Variety](https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/new-microsoft-gaming-ceo-asha-sharma-xbox-games-ai-1236668829/), Sharma said she is "coming into gaming as a platform builder" and that she "wants the right to be trusted by players and developers."

Sharma joined Microsoft in 2024 as president of CoreAI and previously held executive roles at Instacart and Meta. Addressing concerns about her AI background, she clarified she has "no tolerance for bad AI" at Xbox.

She added that "AI has long been part of gaming and will continue to be" and that "great stories are created by humans."

In an [internal memo](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2026/02/20/asha-sharma-named-evp-and-ceo-microsoft-gaming/) shared last week following her appointment, Sharma said that Xbox will "not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop."

"Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us."

Last Friday, it was announced [Phil Spencer and Sarah Bond would leave Xbox](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-phil-spencer-and-samantha-bond-leaving-xbox).

"Last fall, I shared with Satya that I was thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life," said Spencer. "From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we’ve built."

Meanwhile, Bond said it was ["the right time for me to take my next step, both personally and professionally"](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sarah-bond-says-it-was-the-right-time-to-step-down-as-xbox-president) as she stepped down as president of Xbox.

"We're living through a transformative technological era that will shape the next generation of our industry, and I'm energised by what's ahead," Bond said. "This moment also presents a unique opportunity for fresh eyes and new leadership to guide the team into its next chapter."
