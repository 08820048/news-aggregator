[_Kill Bill_](https://www.polygon.com/quentin-tarantinos-kill-bill-the-whole-bloody-affair-trailer/) has seen a major resurgence lately. _Fortnite_ even explored a “[lost chapter](https://www.polygon.com/fortnite-quentin-tarantino-kill-bill-yukis-revenge/)” in an animated short that brought Uma Thurman back as the Bride, while _Jujutsu Kaisen_ animators used the Bride’s showdown with the Crazy 88 as [inspiration for Maki’s brutal takedown](https://www.polygon.com/jujutsu-kaisen-season-3-perfect-preperation-highest-rated-episode-controversy/) of the Zenin Clan. On top of that, _The Whole Bloody Affair_ — Quentin Tarantino’s four-and-a-half-hour combined cut of _Kill Bill: Vol. 1_ (2003) and _Vol. 2_ (2004) — finally hit theaters last December. And now, that once-elusive version is coming to digital on Feb. 17.

Although listings from most of the usual digital retailers aren’t up yet, [Apple TV lists](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/kill-bill-the-whole-bloody-affair/umc.cmc.1us8j95kqhgm6janm37t70m5d) _The Whole Bloody Affair_ as available to pre-order for $19.99. _Kill Bill_ follows Thurman Beatrix Kiddo, aka The Bride (Uma Thurman), an assassin who tries to leave behind her profession and her boss, Bill (David Carradine), when she finds out she’s pregnant with his kid. After her former allies ambush her and leave her for dead on the boss’s order, Beatrix awakens from a coma years later and sets out on a revenge tour, attempting to eliminate all who crossed her and saving Bill for last.

Originally conceived as a single movie, the film was split into two volumes at the time of release. Although fans of director [Quentin Tarantino](https://www.polygon.com/quentin-tarantino-kill-bill-prequel-fortnite/) usually hold the _Kill Bill_ films in high regard, it was never nominated for an Oscar like the director's other works, like _Inglourious Basterds_ or _[Once Upon a Time in Hollywood](https://www.polygon.com/22556001/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-novel-review-quentin-tarantino/)._ However, _Kill Bill: Vol. 1_ is rated [85% on Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/kill_bill_vol_1), and _Kill Bill: Vol. 2_ [is 84%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/kill_bill_volume_2), with _The Whole Bloody Affair_ at 100% based on 29 reviews.

With all the renewed hype around the 20-plus-year-old films, Tarantino diehards are once again hoping for news on the long-teased _Kill Bill Vol. 3_. Fans have already begun casting roles in their heads, with Uma Thurman’s daughter Maya Hawke frequently floated as B.B., and Zendaya emerging as a popular choice to play a young woman seeking revenge against Beatrix. But until then, purchasing _The Whole Bloody Affai_r could bolster those chances, as well as watching the _Fortnite_ short film between _Vol. 1_ and _2_ for a complete viewing experience.
