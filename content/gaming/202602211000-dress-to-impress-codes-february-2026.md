## How to Redeem Dress to Impress Codes

Follow the steps below to redeem Dress to Impress codes and claim free rewards in DTI:

1.  Open the Dress to Impress Roblox Experience.
2.  Click on the handbag icon on the left-hand side to open the DTI Codes menu.
3.  Enter your code in the "Type here..." field.
4.  Check for any spelling mistakes or errors.
5.  Click the checkmark icon to redeem the code.

## Why Isn't My Dress to Impress Code Working?

If the code you're trying to redeem in DTI isn't working, it's likely because of one of two reasons:

-   The Dress to Impress code is expired
-   There's a spelling mistake in the code

When inputting a DTI code in Roblox, make sure it's spelled correctly (for example, a capital I isn't a lowercase l, 0 and not O, and vice versa) and that there are no spaces before or after the code. We'd recommend copying and pasting codes straight from our article to ensure they're correct as we've tested and verified that the codes on this page are working ourselves.

If your DTI code still isn't working after checking for typos, it's more than likely expired and can no longer be redeemed in Dress to Impress.
