Following the [Spider-Man](https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-spider-man-s-h-figuarts-gamerverse-action-figure) and [Cyclops](https://www.ign.com/articles/a-new-cyclops-action-figure-from-shfiguarts-is-available-to-preorder) action figures, a new Marvel character is making its way into the S.H.Figuarts and TAMASHII NATIONS Gamerverse line-up: [Wolverine](https://zdcs.link/9227Be?object_uuid=f75565e9-7776-404a-8555-a97eff7ddc75&t=article). For those who can't wait to add Logan into their collectible collection, this figure is now available to preorder for $99.99 with a release date of September 25 this year.

That's still quite a ways away before it's officially released, but don't wait too long to get a preorder in if it's caught your eye. Figures like these can sell out fast, so it's always worth getting an order in ahead of time.

Out September 25, 2026

### TAMASHII NATIONS - Marvel - Wolverine (GAMERVERSE) S.H.Figuarts Action Figure

Similar to the other figures in this lineup, the Wolverine action figure is close to six inches tall. He comes with some great interchangeable parts as well, including different faces that show gritted-teeth or him shouting. Alongside that, claw parts are included for both of his fists, of course, and he comes with a backdrop sheet that shows off his Fatal Claw move from Marvel vs. Capcom, which you can see below.

Honestly, there's truly no better time to pick up this action figure, what with the new [Wolverine game from Insomniac coming out later this year](https://www.ign.com/articles/some-kind-of-fancy-lawyer-lingo-marvels-wolverine-developer-just-dropped-a-big-tease-for-another-hero-fans-believe). Again, if it's caught your eye, now is the time to get a preorder in before it sells out.

If you're on the hunt for even more action figures to grab right now, both Hasbro and Mattel have some exciting releases lined up. To keep up with the Marvel fun, [Hasbro has revived its classic Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars toy line](https://www.ign.com/articles/hasbro-revives-classic-marvel-super-heroes-secret-wars-toy-line), and for those who have Masters of the Universe on their mind this year thanks to the upcoming film, [Mattel has revealed a new lineup of Masters of the Universe movie toys](https://www.ign.com/articles/mattel-reveals-powerful-lineup-of-masters-of-the-universe-movie-toys) for fans to check out.
