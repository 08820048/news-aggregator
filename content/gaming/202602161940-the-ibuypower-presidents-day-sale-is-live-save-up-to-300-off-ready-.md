iBuypower - one of the more popular and well known system builders on the market - has officially launched its [Presidents Day Sale](https://zdcs.link/QG81jK?object_uuid=e8301e6b-b985-44d6-abf4-4040afcde9f7&t=article) with a new coupon code "**STARS**" that offers up to $300 off in tiered savings on ready-to-ship and custom prebuilt gaming PCs. Unless you have a specific need, I highly recommend you go with one of iBuypower's ready-to-ship, or "RDY", gaming PC; they're usually less expensive and ship out more quickly than your standard system.

Apply coupon code "**STARS**" in cart to save:

-   **$50 off over $999**
-   **$100 off over $1,499**
-   **$200 off over $2,499**
-   **$300 off over $3,499**

The sale runs through this weekend and Presidents Day, and will expire at end of day on February 16. iBuypower offers free standard shipping on all configs, however can also get a slight discount by choosing a slower shipping service. All systems are covered by a three year labor and two year parts warranty. Below are the best deals sorted by GPU.

## iBuypower Radeon RX 9070 XT Gaming PC for $1,899

The Element Pro is iBuypower's best prebuilt for 4K gaming priced under $2,000. It's equipped with an AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU, AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT 16GB GPU, 32GB of DDR5-6000MHz RAM, and a 2TB SSD.

The AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT is the only 2025 graphics card that we gave a [10/10 score](https://www.ign.com/articles/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-review). If you plan to game primarily on a 4K monitor, then this GPU is up to the task. Even though at MSRP it costs $150 less than the RTX 5070 Ti GPU, the 9070 XT can easily go head to head with it on several of the games we tested. By going with an AMD card, you do miss out on Nvidia's admittedly superior ray tracing performance, DLSS upscaling, and multi-frame gen, but you also save $400 compared to iBuypower's least expensive RTX 5070 Ti prebuilt.

## iBuypower GeForce RTX 5070 Ti Gaming PC for $2,349

### iBuypower Y70 Touch Infinite Gundam Limited Edition AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D GeForce RTX 5070 Ti Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)

The best deal on an RTX 5070 Ti gaming PC at iBuypower also happens to be the coolest. The system is enclosed in a custom designed and officially licensed HYTE limited-edition Gundam-themed Y70 chassis with a built-in 14" 1100x3840 touchscreen display. The case alone sells for [$500 on HYTE's website](https://zdcs.link/z64Yxd?object_uuid=e8301e6b-b985-44d6-abf4-4040afcde9f7&t=article).

The system is equipped with an AMD Ryzen 9 9800X3D CPU, GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GPU, 32GB of DDR5-6000MHz RAM, and a 2TB SSD. The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is one of the fastest gaming CPUs on the market, thanks to the 3D-V-Cache technology that's only found in AMD's X3D lineup. [On Passmark](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/top-gaming-cpus.html), the 9800X3D has the second highest gaming score, trailing a mere 300 points behind the considerably pricier 9900X3D.

The RTX 5070 Ti offers the best bang for your buck amongst the new Nvidia Blackwell cards in terms of 4K gaming performance. It performs neck-and-neck with the previous generation RTX 4080 Super and pulls ahead in any game that supports multi-frame generation, especially with the [recent DLSS 4.5 update](https://in.ign.com/tech/251831/feature/nvidia-here-is-why-i-chose-team-green-and-how-dlss-45-and-its-2nd-gen-transformer-model-changed-my-g). Since the RTX 5070 Ti GPU is non-existent as a standalone card, the only way to get one without paying a ridiculous markup is by getting a prebuilt computer.

### iBuypower Element AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D RTX 5070 Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)

The iBuypower Element is equipped with an AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU, GeForce RTX 5070 12GB GPU, 32GB of DDR5-5600MHz RAM, and a 2TB SSD. The 7800X3D might be a generation older, but it's still considered one of the best gaming CPUs you can get (it's within 1%-5% of the 9800X3D in gaming performance).

This system is a good fit for gamers who run QHD (2560x1440) or WQHD (3440x1440) monitors. The RTX 5070 performs a bit better than the RTX 4070 Super but with the added benefit of newer GDDR7 RAM and multi-frame generation. The 5070 is a superb card for 1080p or 1440p gaming, but it will also play most games just fine in 4K, especially if you're running older or less demanding games. I myself gamed on an RTX 3080 (which is inferior to the 5070) on a 4K monitor for years without any complaints until I finally upgraded last year.

## iBuypower GeForce RTX 5060 Ti Gaming PC for $1,579

### iBuypower Slate AMD Ryzen 7 9700X RTX 5060 Ti Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)

For comfortable 1080p gaming without overspending, the RTX 5060 Ti is the card you want. This system is equipped with an AMD Ryzen 7 9700X CPU, GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB GPU, 32GB of DDR5-6000MHz RAM, and a 1TB SSD.

RTX 5060 Ti GPUs comes in two variants: an excellent 16GB model and a ridiculously lame 8GB model. Fortunately, this system **is equipped with the 16GB model**. The RTX 5060 Ti (16GB) is a great GPU for 1080p gaming. It outperforms the RTX 4060 Ti by about 20% (greater if the game supports DLSS 4.5). The 16GB of VRAM also allows this GPU to hold its own in 1440p gaming. Check out our [RTX 5060 Ti review](https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-review) for more details.

### iBuypower Slate Intel Core i9-14900KF GeForce RTX 5080 Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)

If you're looking for a system that will run 4K games for at least a few years (and probably more) down the road, then the RTX 5080 is a good option for you. With this card, you can very easily skip the next generation of Nvidia GPUs. This system includes an Intel Core i9-14900KF CPU, RTX 5080 16GB CPU, 32GB of DDR5-6000MHz RAM, and a 2TB SSD.

The RTX 5080 is a powerhouse. It's one of the fastest cards on the market, bested only by the $2,000 RTX 5090 and the discontinued $1,600 RTX 4090. This is a phenomenal card for playing the latest, most demanding games in 4K resolution at high settings and ray tracing enabled. Check out our [GeForce RTX 5080 review](https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review) for our hands-on impressions.
