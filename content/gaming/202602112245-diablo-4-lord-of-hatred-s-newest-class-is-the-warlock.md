summary: "Blizzard reveals the new class coming in Diablo 4 Lord of Hatred: the Warlock, who is also coming to Diablo 2 Resurrected."
---
A brand-new class is coming to [_Diablo 4_](https://www.polygon.com/game/diablo-4/40629/) in April with the [_Lord of Hatred_ expansion](https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-expansion-lord-of-hatred-release-date-paladin-horadric-cube/): the demon-summoning Warlock. But Diablo fans won’t have to wait very long to get a first taste of what the Warlock is capable of, because the new class is also coming to [_Diablo 2: Resurrected_](https://www.polygon.com/game/diablo-2-resurrected/40820/) today.

The Warlock, a summoner, shares some similarities with previous classes like the Necromancer and Witch Doctor. But instead of summoning undead creatures or a swarm of pets to fight on their behalf, Warlocks tap the forces of Hell, unleashing demons to do their dirty work. That includes calling forth demon allies to engage in hand-to-hand combat, and in some cases, turning a group of demons into a fused wall of flesh that acts as an angry shield.

Blizzard describes the Warlock as the most “heavy metal” class to date for _Diablo 4_, where they will serve as a dark counterpart to [the game’s new Paladin class](https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-paladin-season-11-impressions/), also available through _Diablo 4_: _Lord of Hatred_. In [_Diablo 2: Resurrected_](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22701208/diablo-2-resurrected-review-ps5-xbox-series-x-pc-switch/), the Warlock is a bit more understated, reflecting the class’ evolution over the course of the Diablo story.

The Warlock is also coming to free-to-play mobile/PC game [_Diablo Immortal_](https://www.polygon.com/game/diablo-immortal/40450/), but that particular version of her — and the return of Lut Gholein, her home — won’t arrive until summer.

## The Warlock joins Diablo 2

In _Diablo 2: Resurrected_, the Warlock seems to really hate getting his hands dirty: In a version of the character that I played at Blizzard headquarters, the Warlock wouldn’t even touch his weapons, instead commanding them telekinetically to slash monsters or cast spells. In his off hand, he carried either a tome of spells or a shield.

In addition to casting spells and laying down sigils that debuff or damage foes, the Warlock can summon three types of demons: the Goatman, the Tainted, and the Defiler. They’ll fight alongside him, chasing down enemies and following the Warlock on his journey through Sanctuary. The Warlock can also “bind” a demon, allowing him to benefit from the demon’s unique abilities. Once he’s done with a demon, Warlocks can devour them, absorbing their lifeforce and gaining temporary buffs and traits, based on the demon consumed.

_Diablo 2: Resurrected_ developers likened the demon-devouring mechanic to lightly Pokémon-like, with different breeds of demon having their own characteristics.

Players can get access to the Warlock with _Diablo 2: Resurrected – Reign of the Warlock_ add-on, a paid expansion that will be released on Feb. 11 for the PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch versions of the game.

In addition to the Warlock, the _Reign of the Warlock_ DLC will bring with it enhanced Terror Zones that offer more challenge and greater rewards; new Heralds of Terror in Hell difficulty, which are “hunters who stalk players and become exponentially more dangerous with each encounter”; and a punishing new boss battle against the Colossal Ancients, which Blizzard describes as “the next evolution of endgame battles, designed to push your skills and builds to the next level.”

_Reign of the Warlock_ also introduces multiple quality of life updates, including loot filters, advanced stash tabs (now with item stacking!), and the Chronicle, which lets players track items they’ve collected, including uniques, sets, and runewords.

## The Warlock in Diablo 4 and Diablo Immortal

While the Warlock in _Diablo 2: Resurrected_ is a very capable summoner of Hell’s forces, its appearance in _Diablo 4_ will see the class “at the height of strength,” Blizzard says. The Warlock will command demons and hellfire’s destructive power, turning the wrath of Hell against itself, when _Diablo 4: Lord of Hatred_ launches on April 28.

Blizzard promises to reveal more details about the Warlock in _Diablo 4_ during a Developer Update on March 5 at 2 p.m. PST / 5 p.m. EST.

On Wednesday, in addition to officially revealing the Warlock, Blizzard also revealed more details about _Lord of Hatred_. The expansion will take _Diablo 4_ players to Skovos, the Mediterranean-inspired home of the Askari (aka the Amazons) where they’ll learn more about the birthplace of humanity and “secrets of the Askari, the Prime Evils, and the ancient wars that shaped Sanctuary.”

In terms of gameplay, _Diablo 4_ players will be able to take part in new War Plans, an endgame activity that effectively answers “What should I do next?” when you think you’re done with the game. War Plans are a playlist of activities that draw from core endgame modes (the Pit, Internal Hordes, Helltides, Whispers, Nightmare Dungeons, Lair Bosses, and the Undercity), giving players new rewards to chase.

Each activity in War Plans will let players progress through a unique activity, letting players “change rewards, tweak monster spawns, and even bring features from one activity into another,” Blizzard says.

There’s a new “hyper-rare” endgame event called Echoing Hatred, which sounds like _Diablo 4_’s version of Horde Mode. By collecting rare Traces of Echoes, players can battle against infinite waves of enemies with escalating difficulty in Echoing Hatred. The longer you stay alive, the better the loot you’ll earn.

_Diablo 4: Lord of Hatred_ will also include balance and quality of life changes, including an overhauled and expanded skill tree with customizable skills; the return of the Horadric Cube for forging rare items; and the long-awaited addition of fishing to the Diablo franchise.

In _Diablo Immortal_, players will get their hands on the Warlock sometime this summer. The mobile version of the new class will be centered around a demon known as the Soulgorger, which devours other demons and absorbs their traits. The Warlock herself can “spew fire, slash holes in reality, and summon and chain demons,” Blizzard says.

_Diablo Immortal_ will introduce the Warlock with a dedicated origin quest and a mission to take down The Maiden of Anguish, Andariel, who has seized control of Lut Gholein to torment its residents.

Suffice it to say, 2026 will be a big year for the Warlock and Diablo, which celebrates its [30th anniversary](https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24250353/witness-the-diablo-30th-anniversary-spotlight) this year. Expect more details on the future of the Warlock class on March 5, and a chance to experience it in [_Diablo 4_](https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-paladin-season-11-impressions/) in April.
