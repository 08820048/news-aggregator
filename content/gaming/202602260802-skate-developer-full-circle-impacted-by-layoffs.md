Skate developer Full Circle is changing its team structure, leading to an undisclosed number of layoffs.

In a [blog post](https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/full-circle/news/an-update-from-fullcircle?utm_campaign=skt_hd_ww_ic_ic_twt_fc-update-from-full-circle&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&cid=88627&ts=1772049883093), Full Circle – which is part of Electronic Arts' studio network – said it is "reshaping to better support Skate's long-term future and focus the team on the things that matter most" to players.

"The teammates affected are talented colleagues and friends who helped build the foundation of Skate," it said.

"Their creativity and dedication are deeply ingrained in what players experience today. This decision is not a reflection of their impact and we're committed to supporting them through this transition."

The developer added: "Our work on Skate continues. We look forward to working with you as we move faster, listen more closely, and deliver consistently for all \[players\]. Our commitment to Skate, and to the millions of players who believe in it, remains strong."

According to Full Circle's LinkedIn profile, the studio employs 200 staff. _GamesIndustry.biz_ has reached out to EA to clarify how many roles have been impacted.

Affected employees have shared the news on LinkedIn, including senior environment and material artist [Tyler De Block](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tylerdeblock_i-dont-usually-post-but-after-more-than-activity-7432642727495806976-qVUo?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABjWlJcBgWZd-6PIVw2G3DLSNO6r-Vf4WS0).

"After more than 20 years of survival in the games industry, I was impacted today by the recent layoffs at Full Circle," he wrote.

"My thoughts are with everyone affected. This one hits hard, skateboarding has been part of my life for years, and the Full Circle team was truly welcoming and supportive. It was a place where I genuinely felt like I belonged. It's another difficult day for game developers, and it's exhausting to see this cycle continue across the industry."

Skate 4 launched in early access last September. The free-to-play multiplayer [surpassed 15 million players](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/skate-4-surpasses-15m-players-news-in-brief) the following month.

In April 2025, [EA cut 200 jobs](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-cuts-another-200-jobs-in-service-of-driving-future-growth-bringing-total-job-losses-to-around-300) "in service of driving future growth." This came on top of [layoffs at Respawn Entertainment](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/respawn-cancels-two-early-stage-projects-and-cuts-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-teams-resulting-in-100-layoffs), which affected 100 people.

"As part of our continued focus on long-term strategic priorities, we've made select changes within our organisation that more effectively aligns teams and allocates resources in service of driving future growth," the publisher said.
