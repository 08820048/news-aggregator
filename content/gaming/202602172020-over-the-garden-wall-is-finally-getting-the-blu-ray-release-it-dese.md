Over the Garden Wall is one of those animated masterpieces that I find myself returning to every year. It only ran for one season on Cartoon Network, but it has everything I love in a cartoon. There's great characters, funny moments, and just enough darkness to hold your attention. It's got all of the appeal of Adventure Time, but neatly wrapped up into 10 wonderful episodes. And now, 12 years after its original release, it's getting the Blu-ray treatment.

Like [many other Cartoon Network favorites](https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-watch-every-cartoon-network-show-removed-from-hbo-max), Over the Garden Wall was removed from HBO Max years ago. You can still stream it on Hulu in the U.S., but there's no guarantee it will be available on streaming forever. This Blu-ray release is a great chance to own a physical copy that entertainment companies won't be able to take away from you.

### Over the Garden Wall - The Complete Series (Blu-ray)

This isn't the first time Over the Garden Wall has gotten a physical release, but it is the first Blu-ray to be released in the U.S. since the show aired back in 2014. There aren't yet any details available about what bonus features the Blu-ray will include, but we can look at the [UK-exclusive Blu-ray](https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Over-the-Garden-Wall-Blu-ray/256135/) to make some guesses about what you can expect. That version was released back in 2020 with additional commentary and a music-only track.

If you aren't already familiar with Over the Garden Wall, I highly recommend you check out the series. The story follows half-brothers Wirt (voiced by Elijah Wood) and Greg (voiced by Collin Dean) who get lost in a mysterious supernatural forest. The series was created by Patrick McHale, who served as a creative director in the early seasons of Adventure Time. It's got just the right amount of weirdness and heart to stick with you long after you watch it.

According to the Amazon listing, the Blu-ray is set to release on April 7, 2026. You can currently preorder it with Amazon's preorder price guarantee. I highly recommend picking up a copy while it's available and binging all of the episodes during the fall when the atmosphere fits the show's vibe.

### Where to Stream Online

[![Disney+ and Hulu](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/02/disneyhuluuuu-1748879730938.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/yA8Vw?object_uuid=6ae9fd73-105a-4385-ae29-9cc04bad57f5&t=article "Disney+ and Hulu")

### Disney+ and Hulu

$12.99/month with ads, $19.99/month ad-free.

Although it's no longer on HBO Max, you can still watch all 10 episodes of Over the Garden Wall on Hulu. It is still possible to get a standalone subscription of Hulu, but I'd recommend grabbing one of the [Disney+ bundles](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-disney-plus-deals) if you're going to take that route. It's already been announced that Hulu [will be merging with Disney+ in 2026](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-12-30/disney-to-integrate-hulu-disney-in-2026).
