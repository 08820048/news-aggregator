As Microsoft's position in the game console space seems increasingly diminished, the new CEO of Microsoft Gaming says she's fully committed to delivering a new [Xbox](https://www.polygon.com/xbox/) console. In an [email to employees](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2026/02/20/asha-sharma-named-evp-and-ceo-microsoft-gaming/) announcing her role [replacing outgoing Xbox boss Phil Spencer](https://www.polygon.com/xbox-phil-spencer-retiring-microsoft-ai-exec-asha-sharma-sarah-bond/), newly minted Microsoft Gaming CEO Asha Sharma says that the ["this is an Xbox"](https://www.polygon.com/xbox/481234/this-is-an-xbox-hands-on-cloud-gaming/) mantra applies to future dedicated console hardware, too.

Sharma heralded "the return of Xbox" during her tenure as Microsoft Gaming CEO, promising, "We will celebrate our roots with a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console which has shaped who we are. It connects us to the players and fans who invest in Xbox, and to the developers who build ambitious experiences for it."

That said, the [Xbox everywhere-and-anywhere plan](https://www.polygon.com/next-gen-xbox-backward-compatible-steam-playstation-games/) still applies. "Gaming now lives across devices, not within the limits of any single piece of hardware," Sharma wrote. "As we expand across PC, mobile, and cloud, Xbox should feel seamless, instant, and worthy of the communities we serve. We will break down barriers so developers can build once and reach players everywhere without compromise."

Sharma's promises to Xbox fans also include games that "take risks." Working with newly promoted Xbox chief content officer Matt Booty, "We will enter new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most."

"To meet the moment, we will invent new business models and new ways to play by leaning into what we already have: iconic teams, characters, and worlds that people love," Sharma said. "But we will not treat those worlds as static IP to milk and monetize. We will build a shared platform and tools that empower developers and players to create and share their own stories.

A promise that might just reassure longtime Xbox fans and generative AI haters is Sharma's pledge to "not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop." That's a big contrast from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's highly publicized bristling at the term "slop" when it comes to AI-produced content, [as outlined in a blog post from late 2025](https://snscratchpad.com/posts/looking-ahead-2026/), when Nadella argued that "we need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication."

But Sharma's position on generative AI seems pretty clear, at least when it comes to Xbox games: "Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us," she wrote.

As a relative newcomer to Microsoft and Xbox, Sharma faces an uphill battle in turning the Xbox brand around. But on paper at least, her direction seems clear, pledging to double down on Xbox console development, Xbox Game Studios, and established IP. Whether that ultimately happens remains to be seen, but the next generation of Xbox seems, at the very least, promising.
