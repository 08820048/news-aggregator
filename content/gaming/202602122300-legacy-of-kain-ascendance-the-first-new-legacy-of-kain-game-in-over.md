Crystal Dynamics has revealed the first brand new Legacy of Kain game in over two decades. It's called Legacy of Kain: Ascendance, and it's out sooner than you'd think: on March 31, 2026. That's next month!

Ascendance is admittedly a bit different in genre and viewpoint than past Legacy of Kain games. It's a retro pixel sidescroller platformer starring four characters familiar to Legacy of Kain fans: Kain himself, two different forms of Raziel (vampire and human as leader of the Sarafan) and Elaleth, who thus far has only appeared in the graphic novels. Players will spend roughly equal time playing as all four characters.

In addition to retro pixel art, Ascendance also includes hand-drawn, anime-style cinematics, and some sections of art intended to invoke the PS1-era 3D style of the original games. Ascendance will be scored by electronic rock musician Celldweller, who recorded the companion soundtrack for graphic novel Soul Reaver: The Dead Shall Rise. Crystal Dynamics has also confirmed that the original voice actors for Kain, Raziel, Ariel, and Moebius will all be returning to their roles for the game.

Upon its March 31 release, Legacy of Kain: Ascendance will launch on PS5 and PS4, Switch and Switch 2, Xbox, and PC via Steam, GOG, and Epic Games Store.

If you're antsy to play something Legacy of Kain-related in the lead-up to Ascendance, Crystal Dynamics also announced today it would be releasing a [remaster of Legacy of Kain: Defiance](https://www.ign.com/articles/legacy-of-kain-defiance-is-getting-a-proper-remaster-includes-a-demo-of-a-never-before-seen-canceled-game). What's more, the Deluxe Edition of the game will include a demo of the never-before-seen, cancelled Legacy of Kain 6, rumored to have been titled The Dark Prophecy.
