Full of Cats developer Devcats has expanded into publishing to "lend their expertise to indie developers." Its first published title is Feline Forensics and the Meowseum Mystery from Nobody Crown.

Brazilian company Devcats said is would use its "wealth of experience in marketing, community-building, and game development from its portfolio of successful titles," to expand opportunities for other indie teams, and stressed that it was willing to publish "more than just cat-centric games."

Devcats is open to all "cozy and wholesome" projects looking for assistance with marketing, localization, music, game direction, "and more." Contact the team via its [website](https://www.devcatsgames.com/) for further information.

"Our mission at Devcats is to raise awareness for cat adoption and rescue efforts through the fun, cozy, and wholesome games we create and support," says Fofiño, "an orange cat who designs games for Devcats."

"When developers join our team, they join this mission as well. We will continue contributing a portion of our profits, from our share of the project, to help animal causes in need."

It follows similar expansions from [Phasmophobia maker Kinetic Games, which launched Kinetic Publishing earlier this year](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/phasmophobia-developer-launches-kinetic-publishing-to-support-and-champion-creativity-within-the-indie-space), and [Among Us creator Innersloth](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/how-outersloth-is-turning-among-us-success-into-funding-for-indies).
