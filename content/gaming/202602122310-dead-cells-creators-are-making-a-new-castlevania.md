Konami announced a new Castlevania game during the February 2026 State of Play, and it's a 2D side-scroller made in partnership Evil Empire and Motion Twin, the makers of [_Dead Cells_](https://www.polygon.com/game/dead-cells/39826/). It's called _Castlevania: Belmont's Curse_, and Konami plans to launch it sometime in 2026.

Series producer Tsutomu Taniguchi said _Castlevania: Belmont's Curse_ is the first of several announcements Konami plans to make as part of the Castlevania series' 40th anniversary, but only teased a little about what to expect from the game. _Belmont's Curse_ follows Trevor Belmont's successor in a Paris under siege by monsters, and Konami's goal was turning this adventure into something fresh for newcomers and familiar for longtime fans.

"While staying true to the series, we've introduced fresh ideas and modern gameplay that make the characters' every move more dynamic and rewarding," Taniguchi said. "We're developing this title alongside the incredibly talented teams at Evil Empire and Motion Twin, studios fueled by creativity, pasion, and deep respect for what makes Castlevania special."

Trevor's whip, for example, is his most important weapon, but also functions as a mobility tool, letting him "move around freely like a trapeze artist" and even set up aerial ambushes on unsuspecting enemies. Konami also teased other Castlevania staples, like alternative weapons (you can see a large foe tossing a familiar-looking throwable weapon during the trailer) and a blend of new foes and classic enemies.

_Castlevania: Belmont's Curse_ seems like a natural fit for the series. Evil Empire and Motion Twin didn't just take some inspiration from it for their excellent Metroidvania _Dead Cells_. They even made a [brilliant Castlevania expansion](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23624279/dead-cells-return-to-castlevania-dlc-review-roguelike-release-date-switch-ps5-pc-xbox/) for it.
