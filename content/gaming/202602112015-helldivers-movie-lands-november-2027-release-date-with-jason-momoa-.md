Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions have picked Aquaman actor Jason Momoa to star in their upcoming [Helldivers movie](https://www.ign.com/movies/helldivers-ii-the-movie).

As reported by [Deadline](https://deadline.com/2026/02/jason-momoa-helldivers-release-date-1236715868/) and [confirmed by Sony](https://x.com/SonyPictures/status/2021637571651191023?s=20), the action film regular is now set to lead the adaptation of [Arrowhead Game Studios](https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-developers-dont-and-shouldnt-have-final-say-on-the-upcoming-movie)’ popular video game franchise. With the casting update comes news that Sony is charging forward in hopes of dropping into theaters November 10, 2027.

Momoa made a name for himself as Khal Drogo in Season 1 of Game of Thrones and has transitioned to become a leading name since. In addition to playing Aquaman for the DC universe for some years, he also appeared in movies like 2021’s Dune and Fast X, while also serving as the lead for the Apple TV+ show, See. Gaming fans will also recognize him from his part in last year’s A Minecraft Movie. Details about how exactly his character fits into the Helldivers movie, however, are unclear.

Additional casting and plot details remain under lock and key for now, but we do know some of the creative team handling the project. As [announced](https://www.ign.com/articles/fast-furious-justin-lin-to-direct-helldivers-movie) last December, Fast & Furious veteran Justin Lin has been tapped to direct the Helldivers movie. [The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/helldivers-movie-justin-lin-sony-1236438370/) reported the same month that It and Annabelle writer Gary Dauberman penned the film’s script.

On the production side, we know that Hutch Parker is in the mix, with PlayStation Productions’ Asad Qizilbash also attached. Lin is also involved as a producer via his Perfect Storm Entertainment banner.

Sony [announced](https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-helldivers-2-film-in-production) its plans to deliver a Helldivers movie following the surprise success of [Helldivers 2](https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii). The sequel, a third-person shooter that sees players group up and fight to defend Super Earth from giant bogs, cyborgs, and more, launched in February 2024 and became [PlayStation’s fastest-selling game of all time](https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-playstations-fastest-selling-game-of-all-time-with-over-12-million-sold-in-12-weeks).

As Sony locks down Momoa as its star and Lin as its director, it seems prep for the Helldivers movie is well underway.
