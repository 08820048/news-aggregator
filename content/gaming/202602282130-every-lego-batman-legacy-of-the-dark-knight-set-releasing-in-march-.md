LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, a new take on the classic LEGO game formula, doesn't launch until May 29. Luckily, to hold over all you ravenous Batfans out there, there are a handful of new LEGO sets you can buy that not only look great on your bookshelves lined with your favorite [Batman comics](https://www.ign.com/articles/absolute-batman-vol-2-is-out-this-week-and-is-already-discounted), but come with some pretty awesome, unique digital download codes you can use in the game. What do you get with the download code after scanning the QR code in the instructions? Well, it wouldn't be a LEGO Batman game without a ton of optional skins, and you'll get some fancy gold minifigure and Batmobile skins for your trouble.

There are four of these new sets are available starting on March 1, each of which can be purchased via Amazon or through LEGO directly.

## Every LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight Set

Check out detailed breakdowns of each new set below. The three Batmobile sets each celebrate different eras of iconic Batman films (minus the Christopher Nolan/Christian Bale era, which I am personally bummed about) and will run you $29.99. Each one is a faithful recreation of their onscreen counterparts, complete with a minifigure of that Batmobile's respective Batman.

### LEGO DC Batman: Batman Logo

Out March 1

### LEGO DC Batman: Batman Logo

Of the four available sets with digital bonuses for the game, the Batman Logo is an intricate-looking build made up of 678 pieces that stands fairly tall. It comes with a classic black-suited Batman, as well as a special gold Batman minifigure to help celebrate the 20th anniversary of our favorite Caped Crusader in brick form. The skin you'll get in-game from this set is the gold minifigure.

### LEGO DC Batman: Batman v Superman Batmobile

Out March 1

### LEGO DC Batman: Batman v Superman Batmobile

The Ben Affleck Batmobile is probably the most different out of any iteration of the car we've seen over the years, but it's still a pretty cool design nonetheless. At 220 pieces, it's the smallest of the bunch, but the plated armor details and Batman v Superman minifigure it comes with make up for it. You'll get a gold version of this Batmobile with the digital download code.

### LEGO DC Batman: The Batman Batmobile

Out March 1

### LEGO DC Batman: The Batman Batmobile

I'm partial to the Robert Pattinson version from [The Batman](https://www.ign.com/movies/the-batman) -- this Batmobile is a less exaggerated version of the car we all grew up with, and I love the all-black and off-road-like design. Redeeming the code from this set gets you a gold skin of the Pattinson's Batmobile in the game. This one is 330 pieces, the highest brick count of the three.

### LEGO DC Batman: Batman & Robin Batmobile

[![LEGO DC Batman: Batman & Robin Batmobile](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/09/2-1760028883267.png?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/QGrGGW?object_uuid=3bc0758e-a2e2-4af4-b863-8926317b4649&t=article "LEGO DC Batman: Batman & Robin Batmobile")

Out March 1

### LEGO DC Batman: Batman & Robin Batmobile

For you classic Batman fans, the George Clooney Batmobile from [Batman & Robin](https://www.ign.com/movies/batman-robin) is a 272-piece recreation of that film's vehicle. The red accents on the side are a nice added touch, but sadly the Batman minifigure does not include the [infamous Batnipples](https://www.ign.com/articles/tim-burton-has-strong-feelings-about-batsuit-nipples). And like the other two sets, the digital download code nets you a gold version of this car.
