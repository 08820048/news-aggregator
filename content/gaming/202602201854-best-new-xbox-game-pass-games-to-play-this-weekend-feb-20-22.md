It's no secret that Microsoft and Xbox Game Pass had a rocky end to 2025, with [a price increase](https://www.polygon.com/xbox-game-pass-update-2026-ultimate-price-increase/) signaling that [Game Pass' days of being the "best deal in gaming" were in the rearview](https://www.polygon.com/game-pass-era-best-deal-over/). On the other hand, subscribers who've stuck with it into 2026 have been greeted by an [influx of must-play games in January](https://www.polygon.com/best-xbox-game-pass-january-additions-jan-30/). February has been no different with a stacked line-up of games arriving on the streaming service.

With this week's recommendations of the best games to play on Xbox Game Pass, we wanted to spotlight some of those new additions, including a revitalized shooter, an all-time RPG, and an inventive new indie.

## Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora

I know I'm years late to the party but... _Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora_ kinda rips? The 2023 game, which is set in the same cinematic universe as James Cameron's films and casts you as a Na'vi, hews somewhat to the formulaic Ubisoft approach, but packaged with unrivaled production values. The movement speed and point of view of the player character conveys a sense that you're a ten-foot-tall feline humanoid, with all the strength and speed and grace that would entail. And the titular world remains jaw-droppingly gorgeous to this day. Ripping through its otherworldly forest — whether in first-person or, thanks a recent update, third-person — is a delight. —_Ari Notis_

## The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt — Complete Edition

Sometimes [finishing a game is a Herculean task](https://www.polygon.com/rpg-prcrastination-never-finish-99-percent/). Not because the game is bad, but because it's just so damn good we don't want the experience to come to an end. For me, that game is [_The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt_](https://www.polygon.com/the-witcher/). I love the series ([don't get me started about the books](https://www.polygon.com/the-witcher/600589/the-witcher-3-anniversary-read-the-books/); I'll talk your ear off about Geralt's scruples), and _The Witcher_ 3 is easily one of the best RPGs I've ever played, like it is for so many others. Yet... I haven't finished it! I've completed the main story and the _Hearts of Stone_ expansion, but haven't touched the _Blood and Wine_ DLC yet, saving it for when I'm really in need of a dose of monster hunting. But with [rumors of more _The Witcher 3_ DLC on the way](https://screenrant.com/witcher-3-expansion-2026-price-leak-rumor/), maybe now is the time I revisit an old favorite. And it's a favorite for good reason — the character writing is superb (even if you're not familiar with books), the world is fully fleshed out and lived-in, and the monster hunting gameplay ain't too shabby itself. With [_The Witcher 3_ now on Game Pass](https://www.polygon.com/xbox-game-pass-februry-2026-second-wave-the-witcher-3/), give it another whirl, or, if you've yet to experience Geralt's adventures, go see what the fuss is all about. —_Austin Manchester_

## Relooted

[We've played a lot of excellent new games in February](https://www.polygon.com/best-video-games-february-2025/), but none are as fascinating as [_Relooted_](https://www.polygon.com/relooted-impressions-xbox-game-pass-recommendation/). The 2D heist game combines puzzle-like planning and fluid parkour to create an inventive game that's worth checking out on gameplay alone. But what actually makes it special is its story, one grounded in real-world issues. _Relooted_ follows a team that's out to reclaim stolen African artifacts from Western museums and wealthy collectors. It's presented in a sci-fi Africanfuturist story, but that issue is a very real one. Filled with a wealth of real artifacts, _Relooted_ makes for a great history lesson just as much as a great heist game. Don't miss out on it, even if your February backlog is crying out in pain. —_Giovannia Colantonio_
