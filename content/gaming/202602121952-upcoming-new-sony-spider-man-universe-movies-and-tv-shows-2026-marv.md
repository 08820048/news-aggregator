Spider-Man is one of the few [Marvel heroes](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-top-marvel-mcu-heroes) with a supporting cast and rogues gallery wide enough to support an entire cinematic universe. Or so execs at Sony thought when they launched their Spider-Man Universe of spin-off movies and TV shows. But now there are only a handful of projects left on that slate, the most notable of course being Tom Holland next live-action Spidey movie, [Spider-Man: Brand New Day](https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-brand-new-day-release-date). Meanwhile, Madame Web, Morbius, and Kraven came, went, and will never be forgotten, the Venom trilogy has run its course, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is getting another sequel after Across the Spider-Verse, and the [Spider-Man Noir series](https://nordic.ign.com/news/63957/spider-man-noir-live-action-series-is-coming-to-amazon) is coming soon with [Nic Cage playing the title character](https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-noir-show-starring-nicolas-cage-officially-ordered-to-series-at-prime-video-and-mgm).

While the latest word is that [Sony is stepping on the brakes](https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-spider-man-universe-reportedly-done-as-kraven-the-hunter-targets-opening-worse-than-madame-web) on new Spider-Man villain spin-off movies, there are still some projects moving forward (and several that are in limbo).

To help make sense of the various Spider-Man-adjacent projects in development, we're breaking down every Sony Marvel movie or show that's either been officially announced or rumored to be in the works. Check out the slideshow gallery below or scroll down to get the scoop on Spidey's cinematic future.

## What Are the Next Spider-Man Spin-Off Movies and TV Shows Coming Out? 2026 Release Dates

Here's a quick bullet list of all the movies and TV shows that are in various stages of development:

-   **Spider-Noir Live-Action Series (In Post-Production) - May 25/27, 2026**
-   **Spider-Man: Brand New Day (In Post-Production) - July 31, 2026**

Read on for more details on each project.

### **Spider-Noir Live-Action Series (May 25/27, 2026)**

**Status: In Post-Production**

Following the announcement of Silk: Spider Society (see below), word came that [Spider-Man Noir](https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-noir-live-action-series-is-coming-to-amazon) is the second series to come about from Sony and Prime Video's new partnership. The Spider-Man Noir series is a live-action show set in this Depression-era version of the Marvel Universe, though Peter Parker himself reportedly won't be the main character. Nic Cage has been confirmed to be returning as a version of the character that he voiced in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, only here he's playing the Ben Parker Spider-Noir rather than Peter Parker.

Previously called simply Noir, and more recently Spider-Noir, the show comes from Into the Spider-Verse producers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller and 22 Jump Street writer Orien Uziel, who writes and executive produces. Steve Lightfoot (Netflix's The Punisher) was hired in December, 2023, as co-showrunner and executive producer with Uziel. Spider-Noir will debut in the U.S. on MGM+’s linear channel on May 25, followed by a global launch on Prime Video on May 27.

### **Spider-Man: Brand New Day (July 31, 2026)**

**Status: In Post-Production**

It was unclear after Spider-Man: No Way Home's release in 2021 when the next appearance of Tom Holland's wallcrawler would come. When Sony and Marvel made a new deal in 2019 to continue to share the character, which allowed No Way Home to be made, an [MCU crossover film](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/27/sony-marvel-studios-mcu-kevin-feige-spider-man-3-homecoming-disney-tom-holland) was also said to be part of that agreement. What that crossover film might be and what it's status is remains unclear, although it seems almost certain that Holland will appear in Avengers: Secret Wars at the very least.

In September, 2024, [THR](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/spider-man-4-finds-its-director-1235995984/) had the news that Destin Daniel Cretton (Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings) will be directing Spider-Man 4 with Holland returning as Peter Parker. Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers are writing the script and Kevin Feige is producing once again with Amy Pascal. That October, Holland confirmed that production would begin in Summer, 2025. A [release date](https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-4-gets-small-delay-to-move-clear-of-christopher-nolans-the-odyssey) of July 31, 2026, has since been confirmed, and Stranger Things' [Sadie Sink has been cast](https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-4-casts-stranger-things-sadie-sink-to-star-alongside-tom-holland-reportedly-as-either-x-men-favorite-jean-grey-or-mary-jane-watson) in an undisclosed but presumably major role.

During No Way Home's press tour, [Pascal said](https://www.ign.com/articles/tom-holland-spiderman-mcu-trilogy-marvel-sony) that the thinking is that there will be at least three more Spider-Man films starring Holland. It should be noted, however, that has not yet been confirmed by Sony or Marvel.

### **Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse (June 18, 2027)**

**Status: In Production**

The third Spider-Verse film is called Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse (dropping the Part One and Part Two from the Into the Spider-Verse sequels' titles that had previously been announced). Obviously Across the Spider-Verse, the second film in the series, leaves a lot of questions that will need to be answered in Beyond. Beyond the Spider-Verse was expected to be released on March 29, 2024, but in July of 2023, Sony changed several of its slate's release dates, including this film. It is now expected to be released on June 18, 2027. [Learn more about the Spider-Verse here](https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/10/spider-verse-explained-who-are-these-marvel-heroes).

### **Silk: Spider Society Series**

**Status: Unknown/Possibly Dead**

[

A more recent addition to Spider-Man's world, Silk is a heroine who was bitten by the same radioactive spider that gave Peter Parker his powers. Resurfacing after a decade spent locked in an underground bunker, Cindy Moon has followed the example of Spider-Man and become a costumed superhero. Cindy has actually made small appearances in Spider-Man: Homecoming and Avengers: Infinity War (played by Tiffany Espensen). But we assume the role will be recast for any new Silk project.

Silk was originally announced as a movie, but eventually evolved into a series that was meant to air on MGM+ and Prime Video (the first in a new partnership between Sony, MGM and Prime Video). Into the Spider-Verse's Angela Kang was to serve as showrunner, and the series would follow Cindy's origin story as she escapes imprisonment, comes to terms with her powers and seeks out her missing family. However, in May of 2024, [Variety](https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/silk-spider-society-live-action-series-canceled-amazon-1236006741/) reported that the show was dropped by Amazon/MGM+ and that Sony would be trying to shop it to other buyers. There has been no word on the show since then.

### **Untitled Female Cast Into the Spider-Verse Spin-Off**

**Status: Unknown/Possibly Dead**

[

An Into the Spider-Verse spin-off [featuring an all-female cast](https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/27/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-sequel-all-female-spinoff-reportedly-in-development) was said to be in the works at one point, with Spider-Gwen expected to make her return. Other characters like Spider-Girl, Spider-Woman, Madame Web, Silk and even Black Cat might've been featured. Not much has been heard of this project since it was first revealed in 2018, however, and it seems likely to have died on the vine (web?).

### **Unrealized Spider-Man Spin-Off Projects**

There has been a host of rumored or reported Spider-Man spinoff movies over the years that have never actually gotten made. Along with Venom, one of the earliest Spider-Man spinoff movies Sony pursued was Silver & Black, a team-up film featuring mercenary Silver Sable and master thief/occasional Spider-Man love interest Black Cat. While Sony went as far as hiring director Gina Prince-Bythewood (The Secret Life of Bees) and dating the film for a February 2019 release, it was eventually canceled. Last we heard, the studio was reworking Silver & Black into solo movies for the characters, though it's unclear if there's any movement on these projects at this point. In 2020, reports indicated that Black Cat and Silver Sable might become TV projects for Sony instead.

Variety reported in March 2018 that director Spike Lee was in talks to direct a Nightwatch film, though Lee has since said he is not attached. The vigilante hero wears a durable nanotechnology costume that enhances his strength by stimulating his adrenal glands, but apparently is not capable of getting him out of development hell.

Jackpot

Another fairly recent addition to the Spider-Man universe, Jackpot has often fought alongside Spider-Man in defense of New York City. When she was first introduced, readers were led to believe she was actually Mary Jane Watson in disguise. Instead, it was eventually revealed that Jackpot is an identity used by two different women - genetic researcher Sara Ehret and her admirer, Alana Jobson. It was reported in August 2018 that a Jackpot movie was in development, and in 2020 further news came that Marc Guggenheim was writing the screenplay. No cast or director have been revealed so far and this one also seems unlikely to happen at this point.

At CinemaCon 2022, Sony announced [El Muerto, a Spider-Man spin-off movie](https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-el-muerto-a-spider-man-spin-off-starring-bad-bunny-as-marvels-first-live-action-latino-lead) starring musician, producer, actor, and wrestler Bad Bunny as the title character. El Muerto is a wrestler with superpowers whose mask and abilities are passed down from generation to generation. The film was reported to have a release date of January 12, 2024, at that time, and yet as of April, 2023, [filming had still not begun](https://time.com/6266349/bad-bunny-cover-story/) and Bad Bunny's publicist said the film was "at a standstill," only to later clarify that it was "in development." On June 21, 2023, a Sony press release said that the film had moved to a TBD date. And in September, 2023, [Bad Bunny seemed to tell](https://www.ign.com/articles/bad-bunny-is-seemingly-out-of-spider-man-spinoff-el-muerto-but-film-still-in-the-works) Vanity Fair that he had dropped out of the film. Hmmm...

Sony Pictures Entertainment execs [clearly have plans](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/13/sony-teases-7-years-of-marvel-movies-and-tv) for the Marvel characters they have the rights to. “We have the next seven or eight years laid out as to what we’re going to do with that asset, and that will not only be on the film side -- it’ll be on the TV side,” said Sony Pictures Entertainment chairman Tony Vinciquerra. “Our television group will have its own set of characters from within that universe that we will seek to develop.” Of course, that was in 2019, so we're already six years into his seven...

Could the Olivia Wilde-directed Spider-Woman movie that was reported on in 2020 still be in the works? Or the [Roberto Orci-scripted Marvel project](https://www.ign.com/articles/amazing-spider-man-2-writer-roberto-orci-to-script-untitled-sonymarvel-movie) that was also rumored that year? How many of the projects already reported on fall under Vinciquerra's plans, or have been dropped by now? Madame Web probably already knows, but for the rest of us, time will tell.
