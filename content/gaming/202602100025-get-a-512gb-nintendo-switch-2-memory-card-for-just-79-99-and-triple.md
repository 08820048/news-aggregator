### Samsung P9 512GB MicroSD Express Card

More games have been released for the Switch 2 and some of them require an enormous amount of space. [Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade](https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-review-update) is the most gigabyte-hungry game to date, requiring 90-100GB all by itself. Other plus-sized games include [Split Fiction](https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review) (70GB), [Cyberpunk 2077](https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-review-update) (60GB), and [Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment](https://www.ign.com/articles/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review) (44GB). Nowadays it's completely possible to download just three or four games and find yourself completely out of onboard storage.

This Samsung P9 Express is guaranteed to be compatible with your Switch 2 console. In fact, Samsung is the company that manufactures [Nintendo's official Switch 2 memory card](https://zdcs.link/av8Pr0?object_uuid=47d548c1-2e2b-41f9-8b19-1c6c9a551fd6&t=article). It's very likely these two cards are identical.

The Switch 2 console will only accept MicroSD Express cards. If you have a standard MicroSD card from your previous Switch, you sadly won't be able to use it to store games in the Switch 2. Although the two might _look_ similar, MicroSD Express cards are much, much faster than their precedessors, with speeds of up to 800MB/s.
