Buckle up for a Dimension 20 marathon

## Dropout TV's latest experiment is giving millennials what they want — cable TV

Dropout is entering an era of nostalgia-fueled experimentation. After announcing earlier this month that it would [release two seasons of _Game Changer_ on Blu-ray](https://www.polygon.com/dropout-game-changer-blu-ray-announcement/) (which quickly sold out), the streaming platform is now doing something (ahem) game-changing: bringing back cable TV.

In a video posted to social media on Tuesday, [Dropout CEO Sam Reich](https://www.polygon.com/q-and-a/553902/game-changer-season-7-premiere-one-year-later-paraloubis-voice-mail-musical/) announced Dropout 24/7, a livestream channel that'll air Dropout content continuously. It'll begin on Feb. 18 at 3 p.m. EST with the streamer's flagship actual play series _Dimension 20_, from the very first episode through the latest season, [_Gladlands_](https://www.polygon.com/dimension-20-gladlands-interview-apocalypse/). The livestream channel will then move beyond [_Dimension 20_](https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/518018/dimension-20-ally-beardsley-zac-oyama-in-one-word/) to air the streamer's other shows, like [_Very Important People_](https://www.polygon.com/dropout-dimension-20-very-important-people-vic-michaelis-interview/) and [_Game Changer_](https://www.polygon.com/dropout-game-changer-jacob-wysocki-interview/). Also expect deep cuts like _Kingpin Katie_ or _Ultramechatron Team Go_.

As Reich points out, Dropout 24/7 is just like "regular TV." Way Back When, cable TV was perfect for mindlessly throwing on a _Top Chef_ marathon or getting sucked into yet another block of three back-to-back-to-back _Law & Order: SVU_ episodes, which somehow made for great comfort TV. (_SVU_ is currently airing its 27th season. Cable TV. Wild stuff!) Cable TV was also great for randomly discovering your next TV obsession, something that's easier to do when flipping through channels and stumbling upon something that piques your interest, rather than purposefully choosing to throw a show on the [boob tube](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/641152/why-is-television-called-boob-tube). Who knows, maybe this is how you discover [_Troopers_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvoJXBqLILM&pp=ygUQZHJvcG91dCB0cm9vcGVycw%3D%3D) is your next favorite series.

The video is short on details, but Dropout has posted a [24/7 FAQ](https://www.dropout.tv/24-7-faq), which answers some basic questions: The channel will only be available to Dropout subscribers through the Dropout.tv app, and will not (for now, at least) be available via YouTube. The FAQ also says subscribers have been asking for this channel, "for a way to watch Dropout like it’s broadcast TV." Sometimes, when [burdened by the glut of endless choices](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/streaming-users-overload-choices-1235125685/), what we really want is for someone else to program a marathon for us. [Cable TV, how we've missed you](https://www.fastcompany.com/91253191/you-have-enough-subscriptions-its-time-to-uncut-the-cord).

In the same way the _Game Changer_ Blu-ray announcement teased more physical media if the release was a success (which it obviously was), Reich teased more 24/7 channels for Dropout if people vibe with this first one. Special broadcasts, event weekend, and "bonus videos" are all on the table.

No word yet on [when _Avengers: Endgame_ is coming to the platform](https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkxw9mDHKMGlgorCFGI02T1EtX1ivk0DpuY), however. Alas.
