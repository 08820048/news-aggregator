[No Man's Sky](https://www.ign.com/games/no-mans-sky)'s next big update, Remnant, is here, introducing something developer Hello Games has "been wanting to give players since the very beginning": a gravity gun.

Called the Gravitino Coil, the powerful anti-gravity module for your multi-tool will turn the sci-fi game into "a physics playground," allowing you to "grab large objects and fling, toss, or carefully carry them around the world." It can also be used as a ballistic weapon, allowing you to grab sentinels or heavy objects, turning them into projectiles.

We'll now also be able to collect and recycle the salvage and debris found on planets, turning them into "highly prized" resources, and construct new trucks, tipping flatbeds, and haulers to transport resources back. By carefully sorting and depositing the materials you find — being careful not to accidentally blow yourself up with the "highly volatile" stuff, of course — you'll reap "great rewards."

"You can work alone or join a salvage crew with friends," Hello Games explained. "It creates this really fun and tactile new loop of searching for wrecks, loading trucks full of cargo and hauling across the alien landscape to industrial yards to gain new loot and rewards."

There's also other rewards up for grabs, as well as vehicle parts, a steampunk armor set, and vehicle customization to "create bespoke tracks and haulers for your needs."

Last but not least, there's a new limited-time community expedition on the way, where players can band together to clean up and salvage materials like a space-age trash collection crew.

"Last year was a big year for No Man’s Sky. Even we struggle to know how we pulled off so many large updates last year — Worlds Part II, a Switch 2 release, and Voyagers in the same year, interspersed with smaller but significant updates in Relics, Beacon and Breach," said Hello Games boss, Sean Murray. "As we head into our 10th year post release, our small team is excited for our first update of the year.

"2026 represents 10 years since we launched, and I couldn’t be prouder. For any game to reach such a milestone is a privilege. It wouldn’t be possible without your continued support and we genuinely appreciate it."

Despite being almost a decade on from launch, however, No Man's Sky recently celebrated its best-ever player numbers, following the launch of its [Breach](https://www.ign.com/articles/no-mans-skys-latest-update-breach-adds-space-wrecks-to-explore) and [Voyagers](https://www.ign.com/articles/no-mans-sky-voyagers-update-adds-corvette-ship-class-multiplayer-crew-and-tech-that-will-be-shared-with-hello-games-light-no-fire) updates last year. The Breach update lets players salvage wrecks, unlocking new ship-building parts along the way, while Voyagers added multiplayer ship crew capabilities and skydiving, among many other features.
