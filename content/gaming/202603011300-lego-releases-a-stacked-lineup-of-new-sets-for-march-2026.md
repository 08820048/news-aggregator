LEGO staggers its announcements for upcoming sets, so I don’t blame you if you’re not aware of just how stacked the LEGO release slate is for March 2026. It’s stacked higher than the Eiffel Tower LEGO set. It’s _stacked_, friends.

We’ve got the first Smart Play Star Wars sets. We’ve got Sauron’s helmet from The Lord of the Rings. We’ve got the final battle from Zelda: Ocarina of Time. We’ve got Winnie the Pooh and Batman and a famous painting from Claude Monet. And that’s just for starters, so let’s get to it.

## LEGO The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time - The Final Battle

[![LEGO The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time - The Final Battle](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/26/lego-zelda-ocarina-final-battle-1768576543946-1772128966245.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/QG8pZ8?object_uuid=d7fdb6a1-e443-406e-bbcd-e6fab3db0e7f&t=article "LEGO The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time - The Final Battle")

### LEGO The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time - The Final Battle

One of the most iconic matchups in video game history from one of the best games ever made? [This is what we needed](https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-final-battle-set-leaks-features-link-and-zelda-fighting-ganon), even if we didn’t know it.

## LEGO Icons The Lord of The Rings: Sauron's Helmet

[![LEGO Icons The Lord of The Rings: Sauron's Helmet](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/26/lego-saurons-helmet-1769440507728-1772129368330.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/znB6ml?object_uuid=d7fdb6a1-e443-406e-bbcd-e6fab3db0e7f&t=article "LEGO Icons The Lord of The Rings: Sauron's Helmet")

### LEGO Icons The Lord of The Rings: Sauron's Helmet

How much screen time did my dude Sauron have in the Lord of the Rings trilogy? Maybe a couple of minutes? However long it was, it was enough to turn the evil lord’s helmet into an iconic piece of fantasy armor. I love the look of this set, and I love the reasonable price even more.

## LEGO Project Hail Mary

[![LEGO Project Hail Mary](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/26/bltfe9034ee5bed08f3-11389-boxprod-v39-en-us-1770313722218-1772129271484.png?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/znBeob?object_uuid=d7fdb6a1-e443-406e-bbcd-e6fab3db0e7f&t=article "LEGO Project Hail Mary")

### LEGO Project Hail Mary

First it was a novel by Andy Weir, the writer of The Martian. Now [Project Hail Mary](https://www.ign.com/movies/project-hail-mary) is a LEGO set, just in time for the May 20 theatrical release of the film adaptation starring Ryan Gosling.

## Star Wars Smart Brick Sets

LEGO is introducing a new line of Smart Brick sets, centered around a [brand-new high-tech brick](https://www.ign.com/articles/legoreveals-the-smart-brick-a-technology-packed-toy-piece-dubbed-the-next-exciting-chapter-for-the-companys-future-launching-inside-new-star-wars-sets). Three of these sets come with at least one Smart Brick, which can light up and make sounds based on input from their many sensors. The first wave of these sets are all [Star Wars](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-lego-sets), so expect lots of Lightsaber sounds and lines from the movies.

## LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight Sets

It’s been over a decade since Rocksteady released the last Batman Arkham game. [LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight](https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition) is here to fill the hole left behind. It still has the silly and cute aesthetic of classic LEGO games, but it incorporates many of the fun combat ideas from the [Batman Arkham games](https://www.ign.com/articles/batman-arkham-games-in-order). It looks great, and if you buy any of these sets, you’ll get golden skins for Batman or the Batmobiles you can redeem in-game.

## LEGO Pokémon Sets

These sets technically came out February 27, on the 30th anniversary of the unstoppable franchise. But that’s close enough to March that I’m including them here anyway. Each one of these sets is stunning, so check out our We Build articles based on [LEGO Eevee](https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-lego-pokemon-eevee-set-72151), [LEGO Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise](https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-lego-pokemon-venusaur-charizard-and-blastoise-set-72153), and LEGO Pikachu and Poké Ball for details and photo slideshows on each one.

## Claude Monet – Bridge Over a Pond of Water Lilies

[![LEGO Art Claude Monet – Bridge Over a Pond of Water Lilies](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/26/monet-1772129144871.png?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/QK8gY3?object_uuid=d7fdb6a1-e443-406e-bbcd-e6fab3db0e7f&t=article "LEGO Art Claude Monet – Bridge Over a Pond of Water Lilies")

### LEGO Art Claude Monet – Bridge Over a Pond of Water Lilies

I love the [LEGO Art](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-lego-art-sets) series. It takes timeless works of art and turns them into buildable pieces you can display in your house. This one has you piece together a gorgeously textured version of Monet’s famous painting, complete with a plastic wall mount so you can actually hang it on your wall.

## New Car Sets

There have been plenty of [LEGO car sets](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-lego-car-sets), including some flashy new ones. But one of the most famous cars of all has been missing. No longer, because now you can build the car that made vehicle ownership possible for the middle class and helped shape the modern world. This set would look great as a display piece.

## New Disney Sets

Four new [LEGO Disney sets](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-lego-disney-sets) are out now, spearheaded by the fantastic Winnie the Pooh set. I just re-watched this movie with my kids, and despite being almost entirely plotless, it holds up brilliantly. The writing and acting are top notch, transporting you to the serene world of A.A. Milne’s creation. But the artwork, expertly re-created in LEGO bricks here, are what really draw you in.

## More New LEGO Sets

All those sets above? Not even the full list. There are otters. There’s an orange cat. There are Fifa builds and vehicles that go on land and on the sea. There are flowers and Ninjagos. And even these ones aren’t all that came out this month. You can find the [full list here](https://zdcs.link/aA8gn7?object_uuid=d7fdb6a1-e443-406e-bbcd-e6fab3db0e7f&t=article). A word of warning: use the list wisely, because unless you’re a secret billionaire, your wallet can’t handle it all. Happy LEGO hunting.
