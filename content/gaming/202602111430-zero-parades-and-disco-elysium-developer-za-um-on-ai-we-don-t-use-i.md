It’s pretty safe to say that generative artificial intelligence has become a divisive issue within the games industry and wider player community. As the technology becomes more prevalent, companies and studios are being pushed to offer clarity on their use of it. Within the past few months alone, [Baldur’s Gate 3 developer Larian has faced significant backlash against its use of generative AI](https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-developer-will-hold-fan-qa-about-dev-processes-following-ai-backlash-and-says-it-will-make-changes-to-processes-that-fail-to-align-with-who-we-are), and [RuneScape studio Jagex has promised no AI will be used for any assets a player can “touch, hear or feel.”](https://www.ign.com/articles/runescape-developer-jagex-insists-no-generative-ai-will-ever-be-present-in-any-asset-that-a-player-can-touch-hear-or-feel)

ZA/UM, the developer behind Disco Elysium and the upcoming Zero Parades: For Dead Spies, has offered its view on the issue, and it’s a pretty simple one: “No AI.”

Talking to IGN, ZA/UM’s head of studio, Allen Murray, offered his perspective on the situation: “I think about the world right now, where everybody's dealing with AI in a creative space, and what I see is there'll be a hunger for this singer-songwriter in a cafe. I want a really human experience, right? I don't want a computer-driven creation.”

“I think we'll see more of that,” he continued. “There's always this desire for storytelling and something created by humans that has meaning, that you can relate to. And so I think there'll be a resurgence in that.”

When pushed to clarify the studio’s stance on the technology, Murray gave a simple statement. “No AI,” he said. “As a stance, we don't use it.”

Jim Ashilevi, writer and VO director at ZA/UM, added, “It's all just us being messy and human all the way through. And if it's embarrassing, and if it's not as polished as it would be if you went and used AI or whatever, that's fine. Because all we really care about is just being ourselves, basically.”

“You can feel it when you play our games,” continued Ashilevi. “You can see and feel the fingerprints of real human beings when you exist in those worlds and when you read the stories that we like to tell. I think there's a certain rugged and kind of unpolished quality to the kinds of stories and worlds we like to create.”

Artificial intelligence and large language models (LLMs) were not particularly prevalent during the development of Disco Elysium, but during the creation of Zero Parades they have risen to become a major force in the world of tech. [Google’s new “Project Genie” AI tech has demonstrated a (very limited) ability to create playable worlds based on simple prompts](https://www.ign.com/articles/google-ai-project-genie-allows-you-to-create-playable-worlds-from-prompts-so-of-course-its-been-used-to-rip-off-nintendo-games-like-mario-and-zelda), while [Sony has patented AI systems that create podcasts hosted by PlayStation characters](https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-patents-system-to-generate-ai-podcasts-in-the-voices-of-your-favorite-playstation-characters) and [an assist function that can help players overcome challenges in video games](https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-patents-ai-assist-feature-that-can-take-over-if-you-get-stuck). Not every creative is convinced though, with [Rockstar’s co-founder Dan Houser suggesting that AI is akin to “when we fed cows with cows and got mad cow disease.”](https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-co-founder-and-former-gta-writer-dan-houser-says-ai-is-like-when-we-fed-cows-with-cows-and-got-mad-cow-disease)

ZA/UM’s vision for its new RPG is rooted in traditional development processes, through which it hopes to [create a story about “what it means to lose everything and then keep going regardless.”](https://www.ign.com/articles/power-comic-books-and-zero-parades-for-dead-spies-how-zaum-found-its-disco-elysium-successor)
