Capcom is working on a big [_Monster Hunter Wilds_](https://www.polygon.com/game/monster-hunter-wilds/40940/) expansion along the lines of what _Iceborne_ was to _World_ and _Sunbreak_ to [_Rise_](https://www.polygon.com/game/monster-hunter-rise/40732/). Series director Ryōzō Tsujimoto made the announcement in a trailer highlighting what's to come in _Wilds_ Title Update 4, but gave no indication about what the expansion might include — just that it's comparable to previous paid expansions in scope.

For reference, _Iceborne_ added a large new map to _World_ and what amounted to a post-game campaign, two dozen new monsters, and tempered (high-difficulty) versions of existing monsters. _Sunbreak_ also had a new (smaller) map and more quests, but even more monsters than _Iceborne_ started with. Both expansions featured a blend of brand-new beasts and some critters that existed in earlier games, usually popular ones like Astalos from _Monster Hunter Generations_ and Gore Magala from _Monster Hunter 4_. Capcom also kept both expansions updated for a long time after, with free content patches that added more monsters, higher difficulties, and fresh quests.

On the surface, the news is about as surprising as someone saying "water is wet, and monsters want to eat you." A paid expansion launching a while after the initial game is just how Monster Hunter goes. But given _Wilds_' shaky update history, it's still nice to have confirmation. The game launched with fewer monsters and less to do than its predecessors, and most of the Title Updates since then added less compared to similar updates for _World_ and _Rise_. Title Update 3, for example, added one new monster (Omega Planetes) while _Sunbreak_'s third free update introduced three.

Capcom also struggled to address [persistent performance issues on PC](https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1lvtxvo/is_monster_hunter_wilds_really_that_bad_on_pc/), until a fan [might've found the problem's root on their own](https://www.polygon.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-dlc/). Hence the unusual scenario where, despite _Wilds_ selling 10 million units at launch, [_Rise_ outpaced it a few months later](https://www.polygon.com/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-less-monster-hunter-rise/).

Tsujimoto said to expect more news about _Monster Hunter Wilds_' expansion this summer. Meanwhile, Capcom is celebrating _Wilds_' first anniversary with the free Title Update 4, which goes live on Feb. 18. Title Update 4 will add:

-   Arch-Tempered Arkveld and two new armor sets related to it
-   10-star quests for all four previous Arch-Tempered monsters
-   A 10-star "hunt-a-thon" featuring several Arch-Tempered monsters
-   Weekly event quests

Capcom is running an anniversary event from Feb. 18 through March 19 that includes a free item pack for anyone who logs in and a weekly rotation of hub events, where all previous seasonal events will return.

And since Capcom's data shows that everyone hates Rompopolo, Title Update 4 will add a new limited-time quest with a more challenging toxic bird and fresh armor on offer in a bid to make you want to fight it.
