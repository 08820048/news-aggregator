Glorious garbage

## In praise of the trash Pokémon

I like the trash [Pokémon](https://www.polygon.com/pokemon/). Not the dippy grinning ice cream cone or the [Bread Dog](https://www.polygon.com/pokemon/23290381/pokemon-scarlet-violet-fidough-fan-art/). I mean the _actual_ trash Pokémon, the ones made of sludge and refuse and municipal negligence. They fascinated me when I first encountered them and were a big reason why Pokémon captured my imagination.

Most Pokémon fall neatly into the animal, vegetable, or mineral category. A small subset doesn't, the weird humanoid-ish critters like Mewtwo and the Hitmon family of… whatever they are. Then there's a smaller group of inanimate objects like Klefki and Magnemite and an even smaller set that's none of those at all. These (gender indeterminate) guys:

-   [Grimer](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Grimer_\(Pok%C3%A9mon\))
-   [Muk](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Muk_\(Pok%C3%A9mon\))
-   [Trubbish](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Trubbish_\(Pok%C3%A9mon\))
-   [Garbodor](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Garbodor_\(Pok%C3%A9mon\))
-   [Koffing](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Koffing_\(Pok%C3%A9mon\))
-   [Weezing](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Weezing_\(Pok%C3%A9mon\))

A glimpse at the Pokedex entries shows just how different they are from their peers. Like Trubbish in _Pokémon White_: "The combination of garbage bags and industrial waste caused the chemical reaction that created this Pokémon." And Grimer in _Pokémon Yellow_: "Made of hardened sludge. It smells too putrid to touch. Even weeds won’t grow in its path." Even Koffing, who was just a ball of gas for years before the _Pokémon Alpha Sapphire_ Pokedex said yeah humans did this one too: "Koffing embodies toxic substances. It mixes the toxins with raw garbage to set off a chemical reaction that results in a terribly powerful poison gas. The higher the temperature, the more gas is concocted by this Pokémon."

They're what happen when natural forces mix with human-made elements, in other words. Usually bad elements. Then with a wave of some magic Pokémon wand, _life_ is born. Eat your heart out, Victor Frankenstein. And there's nothing else like them in all of Pokémon — not in the first generation, not in _Scarlet_ and _Violet_. Not even in [_Legends Z-A_](https://www.polygon.com/game/pokemon-legends-z-a/554934/), despite the fact that it takes place entirely in a crowded city.

This mystical in-between-ness captivated seven-year-old me when I first played _Pokémon Blue_ in the late 1990s. The unusual blend of earthy and urban, fantasy and sci-fi was unlike anything I'd seen or read before. Sure, I realize now the concept wasn't _that_ uncommon in media at the time (hello, _Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind_) but I was a kid! The only similar reference point I had was _Ferngully: The Last Rainforest_, and besides, its sentient poison cloud was clearly evil, not a weird evolutionary accident rooted in the natural world. I liked Pokémon for a lot of reasons at the time, but this imaginative take on biology was a big reason why it imprinted itself on my mind.

Game Freak might've moved on to food items and Stonehenge in recent years, leaving behind the sentient sludge and the unique force that gave them life. And my ardor for the series might've cooled as the decades wore on, too. But I'll always have a special place in my heart for the trash Pokémon.
