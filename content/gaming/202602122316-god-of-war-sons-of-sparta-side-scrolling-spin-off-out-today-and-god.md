Sony finished tonight's State of Play broadcast with confirmation of a [God of War Trilogy Remake](https://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-trilogy-remake) project, and the surprise shadow drop of a side-scrolling spinoff — [God of War Sons of Sparta](https://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta) — that launches today.

TC Carson, the original voice of Kratos, popped up to confirm the projects — and presumably his involvement in them. The original God of War launched back in 2005 for PS2, with its sequel arriving two years later. God of War 3, for PS3, then debuted in 2010.

No release date for the God of War Trilogy Remake was announced, and apparently work is still in its "early stages." Indeed, today's look at the game amounted to little more than a few logos — but for fans of Kratos' beloved Greek shenanigans, they are thrilling logos to see once more:

God of War Sons of Sparta, meanwhile, is a 2D action platformer and a "passion project" by indie retro game developer Mega Cat Studios that's available on PlayStation 5 right now, priced $29.99.

It's a canon story set in Kratos' youth during his time training alongside his brother Deimos, getting to grips with his spear, shield and divine artifacts that can be used in combat. Sons of Sparta's story is written by Sony Santa Monica, and narrated by TC Carson as adult Kratos.

Here's a first look:
