Out March 1

### LEGO Ideas Floating Sea Otters

Set #21366.

This adorable set certainly seems like a sweet display to have as well. Coming with 1,234 pieces, it sees you creating a mother otter relaxing in water, but it also comes with a removable brick-built otter pup that she can be posed snuggling with. Seriously, it's too cute.

The mother otter's head, mouth, arms, and flippers can be moved around and posed in different ways as well, so you can choose how you want to show her off once you've finished building. There's even a buildable clam that can be added into the environment. Have a look at this sweet set in closer detail below.

The Floating Sea Otters set is just one of many great new LEGO sets dropping in March, though. If you're curious to see what else is expected to arrive next month, [LEGO Winnie the Pooh and Piglet sets](https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-lego-winnie-the-pooh-piglet-sets) will be joining the party, along with the [set of Sauron’s Helmet](https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-lego-the-lord-of-the-rings-saurons-helmet) and the [LEGO Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Final Battle set](https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-final-battle-is-up-for-preorder).

And while these are looking ahead to next month, it doesn't mean February has been without its own exciting releases. [This month's release lineup is filled with great new sets](https://www.ign.com/articles/new-lego-sets-february-2026), including the [brand new Pokémon LEGO sets](https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-lego-sets-where-to-buy) which are going to be released toward the end of the month on February 27.
