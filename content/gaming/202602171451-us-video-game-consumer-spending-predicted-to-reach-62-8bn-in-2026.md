US consumer spending on video games is expected to rise 3% to $62.8 billion in 2026, according to [data from Circana](https://www.circana.com/post/circana-forecasts-a-transformative-year-for-video-games-in-2026).

Last year, total US consumer spending on video game hardware, content, and accessories reached $60.7 billion – a 1.4% rise from 2024.

The data firm predicts that 2026 could surpass the all-time high of $61.7 billion set in 2021, with growth attributed to Nintendo Switch 2, Grand Theft Auto 6, and subscription-based content.

Circana forecasts that the Switch 2 will continue its successful sales momentum. Following its launch in June 2025, the console became the [fastest-selling console in the US](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/us-video-game-spend-up-3-in-december-fuelled-in-part-by-24-increase-in-subscription-services-us-monthly-charts) after seven months on the market.

However, the data firm notes that rising pressure from component costs could negatively impact hardware sales this year.[](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/steam-deck-oled-stock-affected-by-component-shortages)

[Steam Deck OLED stock has already been affected in some regions](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/steam-deck-oled-stock-affected-by-component-shortages), and reports suggest [Sony could delay the PlayStation 6 to 2028 or 2029](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-could-delay-ps6-release-to-2028-or-2029-as-ai-driven-shortage-sends-consumer-tech-companies-scrambling-for-memory-chips) due to constraints on memory and storage availability.

As for software, Circana forecasts that Grand Theft Auto 6 will play a major role in driving sales across hardware, accessories, and subscriptions – an expected outcome given the title's popularity.

Other highly anticipated games, including Resident Evil: Requiem, Pokémon: Pokopia, and Marvel's Wolverine, are also expected to contribute substantially to revenue growth.

"The 2026 US video game market brings great opportunity – and risk," said Circana's Mat Piscatella.

"While overall hardware faces headwinds, a stellar slate of software and strong subscription engagement suggests a particularly exciting year."
