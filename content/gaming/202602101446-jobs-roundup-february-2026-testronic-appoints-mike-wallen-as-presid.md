"We have been working on this transition of responsibilities for over a year, and I am confident he will lead this game to even greater heights. I will let him introduce himself in his new role below."

Mills added: "It has been an incredible journey to get to this point. I’ve had the honour of representing Rainbow over the past four years and working alongside one of my favourite people: Alexander Karpazis.

"Thank you to all my mentors, friends and of course, my family for supporting me through all the long hours, business trips, and let’s be honest – almost obsession – to my work. I look forward to continuing to put everything I can into Siege and to continue to entertain and enrich others’ lives through the medium that has given me so much."
