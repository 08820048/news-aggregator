Some weeks feel curated. This one feels dangerous for anyone pretending they are done buying games for a while. I have played most of these, paid full freight for a few, and seeing them at these prices stings in the best way.

## **This Day in Gaming 🎂**

In retro news, I'm using a brazier-lit stick to light a 24-candle cake baked for **Shadow of the Colossus**. One of the most critically acclaimed and adored games of all time, SotC was an early games-as-art milestone, thanks to its minimalist landscape designs and the emotional weight of Wander's journey. Core memories for me: marvelling at the PS2-era "fur shell" tech and clocking the game 4 times to get into that Secret Garden.

I'd wager his crippling weakpoint is up a bit more and slightly to the right.

Aussie birthdays for notable games.

## Nice Savings for Nintendo Switch

-   [FC 26 (NS2)](https://www.amazon.com.au/EA-SPORTS-FC-26/dp/B0FHTJBS29?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-46%) - **A$59.50** The football is still slick and surprisingly tactical on Switch, with Career Mode depth intact. Visual compromises are real, but at this price it is a portable time sink.
-   [Metroid Prime 4: Beyond](https://www.amazon.com.au/Metroid-Prime-4-Beyond/dp/B0FR3ZSVZD?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-28%) - **A$65** A confident return to first person isolation and scanning everything that moves. It is deliberate, sometimes slow, but that tension is the point.
-   [Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes](https://www.amazon.com.au/Fire-Emblem-Warriors-Three-Hopes/dp/B09S6D8PS1?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-40%) - **A$47.80** Musou chaos layered over Three Houses politics works better than it should. Repetition creeps in, yet the character writing carries it.
-   [DOOM Eternal](https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/bundles/70070000011030) (-80%) - **A$10.90** Still the most aggressive rhythm shooter around, even on scaled back hardware. Demands focus, punishes panic, rewards flow.
-   [Mortal Kombat 11 Ult.](https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/bundles/70070000011192) (-88%) - **A$10.70** A ridiculous amount of content for loose change. It is messy, loud, and mechanically sharp once you push past the tutorials.

Or gift a [**Nintendo eShop Card**](https://zdcs.link/V0MbJ?object_uuid=1d3bbabf-24ee-4f96-95d4-ce84a9e7b5cd&t=article).

-   [Ride 6](https://www.amazon.com.au/Milestone-Ride-Day-One-Xbox/dp/B0G2KHQSSF?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-10%) - **A$89** Sim leaning bike racing with serious handling depth. Not friendly to newcomers, very rewarding if you commit.
-   [Diablo IV](https://www.amazon.com.au/Diablo-IV/dp/B0BPW7VF2C?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-73%) - **A$30** Loot grind done with polish and constant seasonal tweaks. Endgame balance still shifts, but value here is undeniable.
-   [Star Wars Jedi: Survivor](https://www.amazon.com.au/STAR-WARS-Jedi-Survivor/dp/B0BP5L9VLH?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-67%) - **A$36** Weighty lightsaber combat and proper planet hopping spectacle. Performance patches helped, though it still pushes the hardware.
-   [Battlefield 6](https://www.amazon.com.au/Battlefield-6/dp/B0FKLN96CB?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-55%) - **A$49** A back to basics reset with tighter maps and cleaner class roles. Launch scars linger, yet the gunplay feels right again.

**Xbox One**

-   [Mafia Def. Ed.](https://www.amazon.com.au/Mafia-Definitive-Edition/dp/B088X15G7Y?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-46%) - **A$38** A lovingly rebuilt crime drama with deliberate pacing. Driving feels old school, story still lands.
-   [Elden Ring](https://www.amazon.com.au/ELDEN-RING-NIGHTREIGN-SEEKERS-Xbox/dp/B0DXKNDDLB?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-38%) - **A$34** Vast, cryptic and quietly generous if you pay attention. Still punishing, still unmatched in atmosphere.
-   [SoulCalibur VI](https://www.xbox.com/en-au/games/store/soulcalibur-vi/c3v22fqd8n84) (-85%) - **A$14.90** Weapon based fighting with sharp footsies and flashy supers. Story mode drags, versus remains strong.

Or just invest in an [**Xbox Card**](https://zdcs.link/glwRb?object_uuid=1d3bbabf-24ee-4f96-95d4-ce84a9e7b5cd&t=article).

-   [Battlefield 6](https://www.amazon.com.au/Battlefield-6/dp/B0FKM1JM89?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-55%) - **A$49** Cleaner combat loops and less chaos than its predecessor. Needs a squad to truly sing.
-   [Lost Sphear](https://www.amazon.com.au/LOST-SPHEAR/dp/B077GW52XW?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-68%) - **A$22.70** A nostalgic JRPG with classic turn based systems. Safe, sometimes overly familiar, but comforting.
-   [Stray](https://www.amazon.com.au/Stray/dp/B0B69SG993?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-29%) - **A$28.20** Short, focused and powered by feline curiosity. Puzzle design is light, atmosphere does the heavy lifting.
-   [Diablo IV](https://www.amazon.com.au/Diablo-IV/dp/B0BPMTWL3Y?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-40%) - **A$66.30** Same addictive loot chase, smoother on current gen. Price is higher here, but couch co op helps.
-   [Stellar Blade](https://www.amazon.com.au/Stellar-Blade/dp/B0CTZVLDM7?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-12%) - **A$109.90** Stylish, combat first action with demanding parry windows. Story wobbles, boss fights absolutely deliver.

**PS4**

-   [Assetto Corsa Competizione](https://www.amazon.com.au/Assetto-Corsa-Competizione/dp/B08639KXLY?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-48%) - **A$40.30** Hardcore racing sim with obsessive physics modelling. Not casual friendly, deeply satisfying for purists.
-   [Mortal Kombat 11 Ult.](https://store.playstation.com/en-au/product/EP1018-PPSA01619_00-MK11ULTIMATEKOLL) (-90%) - **A$8.90** Almost everything NetherRealm built in one package. Story is bonkers, mechanics remain tight.
-   [Lost Judgment](https://www.amazon.com.au/Lost-Judgment/dp/B094F3BGL2?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-65%) - **A$35.10** A detective drama stuffed with side cases and minigames. Combat is crunchy, pacing occasionally indulgent.

Or purchase a [**PS Store Card.**](https://zdcs.link/kn6Ww?object_uuid=1d3bbabf-24ee-4f96-95d4-ce84a9e7b5cd&t=article)

## Purchase Cheap for PC

[

-   [Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii](https://zdcs.link/zE8yo4?object_uuid=1d3bbabf-24ee-4f96-95d4-ce84a9e7b5cd&t=article) (-73%) - **A$27.40** Ridiculous premise, earnest heart and turn based brawling. It is long, proudly weird, and worth it.
-   [Dark Souls Rem.](https://zdcs.link/9YR0wj?object_uuid=1d3bbabf-24ee-4f96-95d4-ce84a9e7b5cd&t=article) (-50%) - **A$28.40** The blueprint for modern action RPG tension. Clunky edges remain, design brilliance overshadows them.
-   [Dark Souls II SotFS](https://zdcs.link/98ABpw?object_uuid=1d3bbabf-24ee-4f96-95d4-ce84a9e7b5cd&t=article) (-54%) - **A$29.40** The odd one out, yet full of bold ideas. Enemy placement can frustrate, build variety shines.
-   [Persona 4 Golden](https://zdcs.link/QPxy2O?object_uuid=1d3bbabf-24ee-4f96-95d4-ce84a9e7b5cd&t=article) (-65%) - **A$13.40** A slow burn school year that sneaks up emotionally. Dungeons are repetitive, characters carry it.
-   [Monster Hunter Rise + Sunbreak](https://store.steampowered.com/sub/692569/) (-84%) - **A$14.50** Fast, vertical hunting with endless build tinkering. Grind is real, loop is addictive.

Or just get a [**Steam Wallet Card**](https://zdcs.link/vdlm8?object_uuid=1d3bbabf-24ee-4f96-95d4-ce84a9e7b5cd&t=article)
