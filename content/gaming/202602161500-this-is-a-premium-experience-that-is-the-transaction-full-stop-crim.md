The developer of [Crimson Desert](https://www.ign.com/games/crimson-desert) has confirmed that the upcoming open world action adventure game does not have a cosmetic cash shop or microtransactions of any kind.

Crimson Desert, due out March 19 priced $69.99, is set in a huge and seamless open world packed with enemies, NPCs, and all sorts of things to do. But one thing players won’t have to contend with is a cosmetic cash shop.

“I can say that definitively: there is not a cosmetic cash shop,” Will Powers, director of marketing at Pearl Abyss America, told weekly talk show [Dropped Frames](https://youtu.be/MR9QMXJuGx4?si=JPSch4-nwZYHCeDv) (via [@Okami13\_](https://x.com/Okami13_/status/2023176928870662217)). “This is made to be a premium experience that you buy and you enjoy the world, and not something for microtransactions.

“It’s a monetization model. If you do free-to-play then you need to make up the revenue in a different way. This is a premium experience. That is the transaction. Full stop.”

So, that’s microtransactions ruled out, which is sure to go down well with gamers who are hoping for a traditional single-player experience from Crimson Desert. The game has been slowly gaining hype over recent years, but that’s ramped up significantly in the last few months as Pearl Abyss shared more gameplay footage.

Crimson Desert’s huge open world has been a topic of debate recently. Pywel is divided into five distinct regions: Hernand; Pailune; Demeniss; Delesyia; and the Crimson Desert itself. The main quest revolves around protagonist Kliff’s journey, but you’re free to explore the world in any order, taking faction-driven quests, large-scale battles, fortress sieges and smaller, character-focused missions.

Pearl Abyss confirmed that as the story progresses, two additional playable characters become available, each with unique combat styles, skills and weapons. Exploration is a big part of the game — you travel on horseback, climb terrain, glide across distances, and later access advanced traversal options such as a missile-firing mech and a dragon. [You can even ride a bear](https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-reveals-more-about-combat-and-progression-confirms-dual-wielding-and-a-bear-you-can-actually-ride-on).

Pearl Abyss said the world is filled with hidden treasures, ancient mechanisms, puzzles and points of interest “designed to reward curiosity and discovery.” As for combat, expect to face enemy soldiers, sorcerers, beasts and machines.

[Powers has called Crimson Desert’s open world “absolutely massive,”](https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-deserts-open-world-is-at-least-twice-as-big-as-skyrims-and-larger-than-the-red-dead-redemption-2-map) bigger even than that of Bethesda’s Skyrim and Rockstar’s Red Dead Redemption 2.

Speaking on [the Gaming Interviews YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/aEX6hjTSlOk?si=Ei_PQfEUiBEH5A6F), Powers said that describing the size of Crimson Desert’s world in terms of numbers doesn’t do it justice, because doing so fails to capture the scope and scale of the game. But he did go as far as to compare it to two of the biggest open-world games around.

"I don't think numbers really do it justice because, how big is that in terms of scope and scale?” he said. “But what we can say is that the world's at least twice as big as the open world, the playable area, of Skyrim. It's larger than the map of Red Dead Redemption 2."

Powers went on to insist that the size of Crimson Desert’s open world wouldn't determine its quality. Rather, what you actually do in it is the key factor. "The continent of Pywel is absolutely massive, but size doesn't really matter if there's nothing to do,” he said. “Open-world games are about doing things, having activities, having distractions. So we wanted to create a world that's not only massive, but is also incredibly interactive."

Last month, Powers said [the developers were doubling down on the "optimization phase”](https://www.ign.com/articles/after-going-gold-crimson-desert-developer-deep-in-optimization-phase-to-make-the-game-run-as-good-as-it-possibly-can-before-launch) in a bid to get performance as smooth as possible across all platforms ahead of Crimson Desert's release date.
