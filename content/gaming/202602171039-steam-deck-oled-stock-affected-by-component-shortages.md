Valve has confirmed that the Steam Deck OLED may be "intermittently" unavailable in some regions due to the ongoing RAM shortage.

The company added a note to its store page for the Steam Deck after [reports that the hardware was out of stock in the US and Japan](https://www.techradar.com/gaming/steam-deck/valves-steam-deck-oled-is-out-of-stock-in-the-us-and-i-think-we-can-guess-why).

Earlier this month, [Valve delayed the launch of its upcoming hardware](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/valve-updates-hardware-launch-timing-due-to-component-pricing) due to memory and storage shortages.

It still aims to ship the Steam Machine, Steam Frame VR headset, and Steam controller in early 2026, but is cautious about the availability and pricing of these components.

Valve is not the only company currently affected the ongoing RAM crisis.

Yesterday, Bloomberg reported that [Sony could delay the PlayStation 6's release to 2028 or 2029](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-could-delay-ps6-release-to-2028-or-2029-as-ai-driven-shortage-sends-consumer-tech-companies-scrambling-for-memory-chips) due to ongoing shortages. It may also lead Nintendo to raise the Switch 2's price later this year.

Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa [addressed the situation following its latest financial results](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-working-to-secure-stable-supplies-of-memory-components-to-avoid-hardware-price-rises), stating that shortages "may put pressure on profitability."

"Any decision to change the price will be determined comprehensively, taking into consideration not only profitability, but also other factors like the platform's installed base, sales trends, and the market environment," said Furukawa.

"If the rise in memory prices continues longer than expected, it may start to have an effect on hardware profitability. In this case, we will examine various factors to determine how to handle the situation."
