Fighting game was in development for a decade, but has underperformed

## Riot Games' 2XKO layoffs confirm its struggle to move into new genres

Riot Games has cut the development team of its free-to-play fighting game _2XKO_ by half, laying off around 80 staff, according to a report by [Game Developer](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/riot-games-lays-off-roughly-80-employees-from-2xko-team). In an [official statement](https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/an-update-on-2xko), executive producer Tom Cannon said that the game had not reached enough players.

_2XKO_, which is set within the _League of Legends_ universe and shares characters with Riot’s massive MOBA, was a passion project at Riot that went through an epic, 10-year development, including multiple reboots. The cuts come just three weeks after its Jan. 20 launch.

“I want you to know that decision wasn’t made lightly,” Cannon said. “As we expanded from PC to console, we saw consistent trends in how players were engaging with _2XKO_. The game has resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term.”

Cannon said that a “smaller, focused team” would continue to make “key improvements” to the game, and support tournament organizers and the 2026 Competitive Series.

“I want to be clear about something that matters deeply to me,” Cannon said. “The people who helped ship _2XKO_ poured years of creativity, care, and belief into this game. Taking creative risks like this is hard, and the work they did is real and meaningful.”

“Ten years on _2XKO_, 12 at Riot and I got laid off with 30min notice lol,” designer and producer Patrick Miller [posted on BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/pattheflip.bsky.social/post/3meh7ko2g2k2g). “Gonna take some time.”

The layoffs illustrate the immense difficulty of breaking into fighting games, even for a developer with Riot’s huge resources and the expertise of the _2XKO_ team (Cannon, with his brother Tony, founded Evo, the dominant esports tournament for fighting games). Fighting games have a passionate following, and major titles like Tekken, Street Fighter, and Mortal Kombat sell well. But the subculture surrounding them is niche and fiercely defensive, and the genre has been dominated for decades by a tiny handful of specialist developers like Capcom, Bandai Namco, Arc System Works, and NetherRealm.

Riot [acquired the Cannons’ studio Radiant Entertainment](https://www.polygon.com/2016/3/8/11181204/riot-games-acquires-radiant-entertainment/) in 2016, and [first unveiled](https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/15/20915736/league-of-legends-fighting-game-project-l-riot-games/) its _LoL_\-themed fighting game in 2019. Riot spent years iterating on the game’s look and design before _2XKO_ launched, but it still came under fire from fighting game fans for its arcane mechanics and limited roster of characters.

Riot has long struggled to break out of its MOBA lane, or to translate _League of Legends_’ popularity into different genres. Some spinoffs like auto-battler _Teamfight Tactics_ and shooter _Valorant_ have worked to a greater or lesser degree, but several other projects have been canceled, have languished in development hell, or both. Riot [announced an MMO](https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/17/22187930/riot-games-mmo-league-of-legends/) set in the _LoL_ universe in 2020, after many years of rumored work, but then “[reset](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/riot-hits-the-development-reset-button-for-its-league-of-legends-mmo-the-initial-vision-just-wasnt-different-enough-from-what-you-can-play-today/)” the project in 2024. In 2020, Riot acquired _Minecraft_ competitor _Hytale_, before canceling it in 2025 after 10 years of development. [_Hytale_ was bought back by its original developers](https://www.polygon.com/what-is-hytale-and-wasnt-it-cancelled-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-latest-minecraft-killer/) and released in early access in January.

At least _2XKO_ still exists, and there is still a (much smaller) team working on it at Riot. The studio’s quest to expand its repertoire continues.
