## What Is Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2?

Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 2 is a collection of the previously PS3-exclusive 2008 game [Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots](https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots), as well as the HD Collection version of the 2010 PSP game [Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker](https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-peace-walker). And for good measure, it also contains the non-canon 2000 Game Boy game Metal Gear: Ghost Babel.

This collection represents the first time MGS 4 has been available on any platform other than PlayStation 3. With Konami’s thin release schedule over the past decade or so, many fans wondered if the series’ fourth main assignment would _ever_ be released from its PS3 prison. I, for one, am extremely glad to see that happen, because my PS3 is in some box somewhere in my basement.

And just like with Vol. 1, you don’t have to buy the whole collection if you only want one game. You can buy each of the included games individually on all the platforms’ digital storefronts.
