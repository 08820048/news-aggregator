We already knew that [Overwatch](https://www.ign.com/games/overwatch) fans were returning in their thousands with the advent of [its new name](https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-ditching-the-2-amid-launch-of-new-story-driven-era-with-10-new-heroes) and "story-driven era," but Overwatch hasn't just matched its original Steam release-day fervor, it has _smashed_ it, more than doubling the platform's concurrent peak set back in 2023.

You'll remember that Blizzard's sequel unfortunately [stumbled out of the gate](https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-blizzard-apologizes-for-shaky-launch-promises-fixes-for-queues-and-more), and while it saw a [massive surge of players at the start](https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-has-reached-over-25-million-players-in-its-first-10-days-35-million-in-its-first-month), those numbers [dropped in the following year](https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-engagement-and-player-investment-is-declining-activision-blizzard-admits). As time went on, [user reviews complained](https://www.ign.com/articles/after-becoming-the-worst-user-reviewed-game-ever-on-steam-overwatch-2s-recent-reviews-jump-to-mixed) about a [number of issues](https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-becomes-worst-user-reviewed-game-on-steam-ever-even-as-tens-of-thousands-turn-up-to-play) such as monetization and controversies around the [cancellation of the game's long-awaited PvE Hero mode](https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-pve-hero-mode-canceled-a-difficult-choice).

Now, however, with the launch of yesterday's (February 10) [first year-long storyline, The Reign of Talon](https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-ditching-the-2-amid-launch-of-new-story-driven-era-with-10-new-heroes), Overwatch — the game formerly known as Overwatch 2 — smashed its original concurrent Steam peak of 75,608. And while we'd [already seen a spike in players over the weekend](https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatchs-promise-of-a-new-era-tempts-back-thousands-of-players-giving-the-sequel-its-biggest-month-since-launch), Sunday's peak of 69,135 simultaneous gamers has been almost tripled, with [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/app/2357570/charts/#max) recording 165,651 concurrent Steam players overnight, marking an excellent start for the rebooted hero shooter.

The Reign of Talon focuses on the antagonistic faction Talon as it takes over around the world, while Overwatch continues to fight back. In-game events, hero trailers, animated comics, short stories, and map updates will tell a story across six seasons rolled out throughout the entire year, beginning with the launch of five new heroes as the new season kicked off yesterday.

New heroes include Domina (tank), Emre (damage), Mizuki (support), Anran (damage) — [who some of us met over the weekend](https://www.ign.com/articles/this-is-a-hill-worth-dying-on-overwatch-actor-supports-potential-redesign-of-criticized-character) — and Jetpack Cat (support). More heroes will join in the future, with a new hero added in each of Season 2-6 to come. A new story arc is planned to begin with another Season 1 in 2027.

We're also getting a Hello Kitty-themed in-game event from February 10-23, a new Meta Event called Conquest, where players choose to align with either Overwatch or Talon over five weeks to compete for rewards including lootboxes, skins, and titles. There's also a major UI and UX overhaul with a new hero lobby and a promise of faster navigation on the way.
