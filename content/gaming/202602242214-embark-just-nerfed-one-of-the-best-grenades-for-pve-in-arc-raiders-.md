The [Arc Raiders](https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders) Shrouded Sky update is here, but instead of Hurricanes and new cosmetics, all players can talk about are how it nerfs one of the best grenades for PvE.

Fans expected to see details about all of the new content when developer Embark Studios published lengthy [patch notes](https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-update-patch-notes-reveal-nerfs-for-pvp-and-pve-players-as-shrouded-sky-brings-new-threats-to-the-rust-belt) for update version 1.17.0 earlier today. Information about playable pianos and beard cosmetics was all there, but what they also found was that the studio behind the massively popular multiplayer game had upped the crafting requirements for one of its most iconic tools: the Wolfpack.

As outlined in Shrouded Sky’s accompanying patch notes, the Wolfpack, a throwable equipment that showers Arc enemies with homing explosives, now requires one Rocketeer Driver to craft. Now, players will need the component, as well as two Arc motion cores and an explosive compound, to make just one Wolfpack.

The changes fall in line with a series of new adjustments to resource requirements, which see Arc components also added to the recipes for the Deadline mine, Trailblazer, Showstopper, and Vita Spray. It’s the Wolfpack tweak that has Raiders up in arms, though, mostly because Rocketeer Drivers are infamously rare and hard to collect. The most consistent way to find one of these epic items is to kill a Rocketeer – a task that currently takes two Wolfpacks to accomplish.

Although [some believe the change is understandable considering the previous recipe asked relatively little from players](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rditsw/hot_take_wolfpacks_were_too_easy_to_craft_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), much of the community online has already started voicing their concerns.

“Let me just kill a rocketeer to get 1 wolfpack that can half kill another rocketeer,” one Reddit user [teased](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rdd2f7/comment/o746rwv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

“I don’t even want the blueprint anymore,” another player [replied](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rddfxo/comment/o74jteq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

“First time I’ve said this but if they keep going in this direction people will stop playing,” a X/Twitter user [added](https://x.com/gmanskiyoutube/status/2026377384056725559?s=20). “It’s hard enough to gather some of these resources.”

The grenade can’t lock on to other players but can tear through hordes of small Arc, making it one of the best PvE tools Raiders have at their disposal. It can also quickly dismantle the armor featured on large Arc, such as the Matriarch, Queen, Leaper, and Bastion, but it’s the math asking players for two Wolfpacks to kill one Rocketeer that has fans questioning Embark's judgement. While showing concern about how update 1.17.0 asks players to work harder for crafting materials, some have started chiming in with their own recommendations for how to fix the issue.

“If rocketeers start consistently dropping more than 1x driver, we can talk,” one player [suggested](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rddfxo/comment/o74eo6f/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

“They need to up the drop odds on drivers,” another [added](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rddfxo/comment/o74ffry/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). “Right now you’re lucky if you get two. Make two the base with higher odds of 3+. Otherwise wolfpacks will basically just be used when looted on the map.”

Some players are asking for more rewarding Rocketeer loot and reduced requirements for the Wolfpack, but others are still exploring all Shrouded Sky has to offer. The February update launched today, focusing on [map changes for Dam Battlegrounds and the new Firefly and Comet Arc threats](https://www.ign.com/articles/embark-shows-off-arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-update-with-first-look-at-two-new-threatsand-beards) as its latest additions.

Embark CEO Patrick Söderlund shared more about how the studio plans to continue building on Arc Raiders in the months ahead during [an interview with IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-arc-raiders-interview-embark-boss-patrick-sderlund-talks-live-service-plans-banning-cheaters-and-the-secret-sauce-of-pve) earlier this month. While sharing information about [how its recent success has allowed the team to feel secure about their future](https://www.ign.com/articles/huge-success-of-arc-raiders-gives-embark-financial-security-and-employment-stability-75-million-budget-estimate-not-too-far-off), he also discussed how Embark reacts to player feedback.
