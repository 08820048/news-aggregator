A young Yautja must prove himself worthy of his clan by defeating an unkillable monster in [_Predator: Badlands_](https://www.polygon.com/predator-badlands-alien-crossover-synths-weyland-yutani/), which connects the Predator and Alien movies without requiring knowledge of either. You can hunt it down on Hulu. Fans of [_Sinners_](https://www.polygon.com/horror/556489/sinners-review-ryan-coogler-vampire-black-panther/) should check out Ryan Prows’ [_Night Patrol_](https://www.polygon.com/night-patrol-sinners-director-interview-vampire-lapd-movie/)_,_ which also uses extremely bloody horror to explore white supremacy.

For a campier spin on horror, rent Johannes Roberts’ chimp slasher film [_Primate_](https://www.polygon.com/primate-horror-movie-ending-rewrite-director-interview/). You can also chase down Timothée Chalamet on VOD, where he plays a 1950s table tennis hustler (and [potential vampire slayer](https://www.polygon.com/marty-supreme-vampire/)) in _Marty Supreme_. The tense film received nine Oscar nominations.

Here's a rundown of the most notable new releases on streaming and VOD, including the biggest, best, and most popular new movies you can watch at home right now.

## New on Hulu

### Predator: Badlands

The young Yautja Dek (Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi) is sentenced to death for being too weak, and his only chance to prove himself involves traveling to the “death planet” Genna to kill its apex predator. Teaming up with a badly damaged android (Elle Fanning), Dek learns how to navigate the hostile terrain and claim his birthright.

From our [review](https://www.polygon.com/predator-badlands-review/):

> Badlands feels less like a Predator movie and more like part of the Avatar franchise, another property Disney got in the Fox merger. It deals with the same themes of questioning what you will sacrifice for your family — biological or found — and environmental exploitation, richly rewarding characters who appreciate the beauty of nature and learn to use it in a respectful fashion. Just like in Avatar, none of these themes are especially deep, and the villains are cartoonishly evil. But while Avatar delves further into its exploration of grief and loss, Badlands quickly moves on to more whimsical fare. There’s a whole fight scene involving Thia’s disembodied legs that adds a distinctly cheesy beat to what’s otherwise the film’s best action sequence.

### Primitive War

-   **Run time:** 2h 15m
-   **Director:** Luke Sparke
