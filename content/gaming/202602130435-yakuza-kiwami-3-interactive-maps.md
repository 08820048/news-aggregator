Kiryu might know the streets and alleys of Kamurocho in [_Yakuza Kiwami 3_](https://www.polygon.com/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-review/) like few others, but that doesn't mean you do too. The winding maze of shops, side streets, parks, and entertainment centers is overwhelming initially (and often for a while after that) if only because it's all so crammed with _stuff_. Side stories, locker keys, weapon stores, pools, baseball cages, briefcases, casinos — it's a lot to keep track of. And then you've got Downtown Ryukyu and the (admittedly much smaller) Morning Glory Orphanage to learn the layout of as well. Even if you're familiar with the original _Yakuza 3_, Ryu Ga Gotoku's remake includes fresh additions for side modes like Bad Boy Dragon.

Our **_Yakuza Kiwami 3_ interactive maps** help you find your way with every collectible, quest, and point of interest for all of Kamurocho, Ryukyu, and the orphanage. Our latest update on February 12 has added all locker key locations in Downtown Ryukyu. Kamurocho's map now includes all briefcase and love box spawn locations as well.

Kamurocho never changes, except it kind of does. Despite being the same city as in _Yakuza 2_, you'll find subtle differences in stores and things to do around town and, more importantly, plenty of hidden collectibles like locker keys.

## Yakuza Kiwami 3 Downtown Ryukyu interactive map

Downtown Ryukyu makes up for its comparatively small size with a lot of points of interest and several fresh sub-stories that weren't present in the original _Yakuza 3_.

The orphanage may be small, but there's still a lot to find here throughout Kiryu's time as everyone's dad, including new minigames.
