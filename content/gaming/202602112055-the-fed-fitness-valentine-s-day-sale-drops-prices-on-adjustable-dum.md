[FED Fitness](https://zdcs.link/av8bMx?object_uuid=aec4eb42-b7fe-442b-b823-bd592a42c8a3&t=article), one of Amazon's biggest marketplace sellers of fitness equipment, is hosting a Valentine's Day Sale on its own site, with prices lower than what you can get from Amazon. Currently there are two coupons: a 15% off code "**FEDLOVED15**" and a stackable 5% code "**IGN**" for a total of 20% off sitewide.

This sweetens the deal on top of already reasonable retail pricing compared to brands like Peloton, Bowflex, and NordicTrack. FED's product selection is pretty diverse and includes adjustable dumbbells, power towers, folding treadmills, rowers, ellipticals and more. We all know how heavy fitness equipment can get, but fortunately all orders ship free.

## DB1 52.5-Pound Adjustable Dumbbells (Pair)

There's no need to pay $500 for the [Bowflex SelectTech](https://zdcs.link/zj8ngM?object_uuid=aec4eb42-b7fe-442b-b823-bd592a42c8a3&t=article) adjustable dumbbells when there are equally well-built options at a much lower price point. For a limited time, FED Fitness is offering its own [DB1 Adjustable Dumbbells](https://zdcs.link/QK8m6y?object_uuid=aec4eb42-b7fe-442b-b823-bd592a42c8a3&t=article) (52.5 pounds each or 105 pounds total) for about $315 with free delivery.

Each FED Fitness DB1 dumbbell is adjustable from 5 pounds all the way up to 52.5 pounds. The adjustment mechanism works similarly to the Bowflex SelectTech series; you turn a dial in 2.5 or 5 pound increments which locks in a specific combination of plates that add up to the desired weight. Unlike traditional free weights that take up a decent chunk of space, these adjustable dumbbells are neatly contained in a compact package that measures just 16" square.

The Flybird WB6 weight bench would make a great complement to the dumbbells. It's 96% pre-assembled out of the box so you can set it up in just a few minutes.

The Sportsroyal PT4 is FED's highest end and most feature-rich power tower, yet it still comes in at under $300 after coupons are applied. It's the perfect way to work on your pull-ups, dips, and leg raises. If you can't do several pull-ups in quick succession, this power tower will help you get there thanks to weight assistance for pull-ups and dips. The counter-balance is provided by a nylon rope system; each rope offers 22 pounds of weight and they can be added or removed to adjust the total amount of resistance. This pull-up machine also offers ample adjustment options to cater to different sizes.

## Yosuda TM2 Foldable Brushless Treadmill

_Foldable and Easy-to-Assemble_

### Yosuda TM2 Foldable Treadmill

Also use 5% off code "IGN"

Nothing beats the convenience of a treadmill when you're trying to get your steps in. FED's Yosuda TM2 model goes a step further by offering a steel unibody z-frame design that can fold flat and easily stows away when you're not using it. The 1.25HP brushless motor is smooth and silent and offers a top speed of 8.7 miles and up to 18% motorized incline. The 18" wide track has shock absorbing pads to keep your joints in check, since running is harder on your knees than other forms of cardio. Many people shudder at the thought of installing a treadmill, but fortunately FED states that the Yosuda TM2 assembles in eight easy steps with a grand total of just 14 screws. Talk about a relief!
