### Iniu 3-in-1 Qi2-Certified Wireless Charging Station

The Iniu 3-in-1 charging station has three separate sections reserved for wireless charging your (1) iPhone, (2) Apple Watch, and (3) AirPods. Obviously all three devices need to be MagSafe compatible for this to work. Only a single USB-C cable is needed for all three devices, saving you a couple of outlets and a rats nest of cables. The iPhone charger is QI2 certified, capable of delivery up to 15W of wireless inductive charging. Other smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy Ultra should work as well, as long as they are wireless charging compatible. The other sections support 5W of wireless charging.

The charging station works great at home by your bed, but it's also an excellent traveler. The entire unit folds into a small brick that measures a mere 4" long x 2.4" wide x 0.8" thin. It can easily be stowed away in any small bag or even a pocket. Better yet, a wall charger and USB cable are included in the package.
