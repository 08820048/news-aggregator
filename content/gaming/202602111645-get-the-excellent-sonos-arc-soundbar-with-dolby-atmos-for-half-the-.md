Sonos currently has a President's Day Sale going on right now that takes up to 20% off sitewide, including a $200 discount on the Arc Ultra that drops it to $899. However, if that's still a bit rich for your blood, there's an even better going on right now. The [certified refurbished Sonos Arc](https://zdcs.link/9YMqEr?object_uuid=3a282268-8b9f-406d-b194-cf4a693e38a7&t=article) has just dropped in price to $449 with free delivery. That's half the price compared to getting the Arc Ultra _on sale_ and an excellent deal for anyone looking for a Dolby Atmos capable soundbar.

Sonos refurbished products go through rigorous testing; they come with all accessories, manuals, and documentation and are reshipped in "pristine" packaging. Most importantly, **Sonos includes the same 1-year warranty as buying new**.

## Sonos Arc Soundbar (Refurbished)

[![Sonos Arc (Refurbished)](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/20/sonosarcultra-1763659623846.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/9YMqEr?object_uuid=3a282268-8b9f-406d-b194-cf4a693e38a7&t=article "Sonos Arc (Refurbished)")

### Sonos Arc (Refurbished)

The release of the Arc Ultra doesn't make the Arc any less of a great speaker. The 45" soundbar houses eleven precisely engineered internal speakers, including three tweeters and eight midwoofers each paired with Class-D amplifiers. It's capable of room filling audio by itself, but you'd still benefit from a separate subwoofer to round out the low end. Unlike the Sonos Beam, which only has virtual height channels, the Arc has two physical height channels for **true** Dolby Atmos support. The Arc also has a built-in microphone for smart assistant compatiblity, including voice control.

### Pair it with a subwoofer to round out the low end

### Sonos Sub 4

### Sonos Sub Mini

The audio savvy knows that a single speaker isn't enough to reproduce an entire soundstage. If you could pick only one other speaker to supplement your existing one, then a subwoofer would make the most meaningful impact.

### The Sonos Arc Ultra soundbar is discounted by $200

The Arc Ultra is Sonos' best soundbar speaker, replacing last year's Arc model. Although it is a lot more expensive, you can say that the price premium is justified. Whereas the Sonos Arc was a 5.0.2 channel soundbar, the Arc Ultra ups the ante to 9.1.4 channels. It now has a built in four-motor, dual-membrane Sound Motion woofer to help fill out the low end if you don't want to add in a discrete sub.

## Why Sonos?

If you're looking for an easy solution to add great sound to your home, then you've probably already heard of Sonos. Sonos speakers are very easy to set up, don't take a large amount of space, and most importantly, offer distortion-free room-filling audio. They're definitely pricier than budget options, but the sound quality is comparable to speakers that cost hundreds more or take up much more space.
