Ryan Gosling will notch his fourth Saturday Night Live hosting gig next month, and with him will be the first ever SNL performance of Gorillaz, [NBC Universal](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/ryan-gosling-hosting-snl-march-snl-episode-schedule) announced.

The show will take place on March 7, just days after the band releases its new album, [The Mountain](https://gorillaz.bandcamp.com/album/the-mountain). In typical Gorillaz fashion, the album will feature a lot of guest performers, including Sparks, Black Thought, Dennis Hopper, and IDLES.

As for Gosling, he'll be there ahead of [Project Hail Mary](https://www.ign.com/videos/project-hail-mary-official-final-trailer), a sci-fi movie based on a book by Andy Weir (author of The Martian) in which Gosling plays an astronaut who wakes up alone on a space ship, with the realization he's meant to find a solution to a terrible event that happened on Earth. Also, he makes friends with a little alien rock guy.

In more SNL news, [Heated Rivalry's Connor Storrie](https://www.ign.com/articles/hudson-williams-and-connor-storrie-to-present-at-golden-globes-following-success-of-heated-rivalry) was announced to host as a first-timer on February 28, following the global popularity of the Crave original series which debuted on HBO Max for US audiences, and [continues to break streaming records](https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/heated-rivalry-warner-bros-discovery-record-winter-olympics-streaming-numbers-1236659554/).
