Toy Story 5's official trailer has arrived and, alongside revealing more of the battle between toys and tech, we also learn a bit more about how Woody is reunited with his friends after the events of Toy Story 4.

Toy Story 5 is set to be released in theaters on June 19, 2026, and our favorite toys are going up against their biggest foe yet, technology. In Bonnie's house, this is seen in the form of a new tablet named Lilypad that threatens to change playtime forever.

This is obviously a big deal for the toys as they exist to make their kids happy, so Jessie uses a walkie talkie to talk to Woody and tell him they need help. As it turns out, Woody is seeing many more abandoned toys in the wild as well due to this tech takeover. We all knew Woody would come to the rescue, but it felt like the deal was sealed when Jessie said, "I'm losing Bonnie to this device..."

We see Woody's grand return after he went off with Bo Peep and the lost toys at the end of the last film, and he is now sporting both a poncho and a bald spot that is very shiny. What follows is a glimpse of the adventures to come, including Buzz getting backup in the form of an army of newer Buzz Lightyears.

Oh, and I also want to shout out the beginning of the trailer, where we get to see Bonnie's very stylized version in her mind of the wedding between Forky and a new plastic knife character named Karen Beverly. And yes, Jessie does say, "I now pronounce you husband and knife." It's different from the way we saw Andy play with his toys, and that's kind of beautiful!

We also learned of a few new voices that will be part of Toy Story 5, and they include "Craig Robinson as Atlas, a cheerful talking GPS hippo toy; Shelby Rabara as the excitable camera toy Snappy; Scarlett Spears as the sweet and shy 8-year-old Bonnie; Mykal-Michelle Harris as Blaze, an independent 8-year-old girl who loves animals; and Matty Matheson as the tech-fearing toy Dr. Nutcase." And for those wondering, Keanu Reeves _will_ be back as the Canadian daredevil toy Duke Caboom.
