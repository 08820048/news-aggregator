Xbox has acknowledged widespread issues with the rollout of its enforced age verification process in the UK, leaving many users unable to fully access games and online features.

Overnight, a flood of complaints has arisen on reddit and social media from users who say they have been booted out of games to perform the console's age verification check — which in some cases is taking hours to complete, and for others is not completing at all.

In the meantime, users say they are unable to use apps such as Discord, or use Xbox voice chat in games with non-friends. An [Xbox support page](https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/help/family-online-safety/online-safety/UK-age-verification) for the process now lists an error message, with a note from Microsoft saying it is "aware of the issue and working to fix it."

[Microsoft first announced plans to implement mandatory age verification on Xbox in the UK last year](https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-begins-rolling-out-age-verification-checks-with-social-features-disabled-or-limited-to-friends-in-uk-from-early-2026-unless-you-provide-id-live-photo-mobile-number-or-credit-card), in compliance with the company's UK Online Safety Act. The legislation must be followed by all companies that facilitate online communication — and prompted the early rollout of [Discord's similar age verification requirement that's soon to be made global](https://www.ign.com/articles/weve-seen-some-questions-as-age-verification-backlash-grows-discord-insists-changes-wont-impact-majority-of-adult-users).

UK Xbox users have been able to opt-in to age verification over the past few monhts to get ahead of the moment it is fully enforced, with warning messages on consoles flagging the fact that it will soon become mandatory. Now, a large wave of UK accounts appear to have had age verification made a requirement, with numerous reports appearing online since yesterday evening of users struggling to get the process working.

"This has to be one of the worst implemented things of all time," wrote SymbioticAxehead in a lengthy thread of complaints on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1r1drae/megathread_uk_age_verification_update_causing/). "In the middle of a Helldivers 2 game I get booted right back to the sign-in screen, to be told upon signing in that communication outside of Xbox is now restricted."

The user said they then attempted multiple methods for proving their age, including providing a mobile number, ID and then an age estimation via live video to continued errors.

Various users have flagged the fact that their Xbox accounts are more than 18 years old, but still have been caught up in the verification process. Others, meanwhile, say they made it through the process but still remain locked out of various bits of online functionality, with no suggestion of what to do next other than contact Xbox support.

"The amount of times I've tried to do any method of the verification tonight is stupid," wrote PdoubleEB. "Can't change privacy settings on my Xbox to allow me to see mods on games too. Can't chat on Discord. Utterly broken."

"Been trying to verify my ID for the past few hours," added ColossalNova. "It finally worked but I can't access anything still. No Discord access at all."

"Kicked out of Overwatch game, signed out of Xbox, forced to verify my age or else I can't socialize with people, now got an hour ban on Overwatch," wrote Warlock\_Worm of their experience.

While Xbox is the first of the major console platform holders to discuss its plans to comply with the UK's Online Safety Act, it seems only a matter of time before PlayStation, Nintendo and other gaming companies publish similar requirements. IGN has contacted Xbox today for more on the current issues.
