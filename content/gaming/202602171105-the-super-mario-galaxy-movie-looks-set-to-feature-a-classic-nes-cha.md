Nintendo looks set to feature another deep-cut character in [The Super Mario Galaxy Movie](https://www.ign.com/movies/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie), as seen in a newly-revealed tie-in playset.

The [Super Mario Galaxy Movie Jakks Gateway Galaxy Playset](https://www.ign.com/articles/jakks-pacific-reveals-new-toys-and-figures-for-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie) features figurines of Peach, Toad and... a miniature 2D version of Nintendo's infamous NES robot accessory R.O.B. (Robotic Operating Buddy). Originally released as a physical add-on in 1985, the character has since popped up in a slew of other Nintendo games.

R.O.B.'s appearance here seems to place his presence within the film in the same subplot as Peach, Toad and several more niche Nintendo favorites — such as Birdo and Mouser who were revealed as part of the most recent [Super Mario Galaxy Nintendo Direct broadcast](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-nintendo-direct-everything-announced).

If you're wondering who or what R.O.B. is, then here's a quick explainer. Designed as an accessory for the Famicom and NES, this robot helped win over US audiences to Nintendo's first home console, even if his actual abilities were rather limited.

In the years since, R.O.B. has cameoed in numerous Nintendo games, most notably as a playable character in Mario Kart DS, and as a part of the Super Smash Bros. fighter roster since the days of Wii installment Brawl.

While there was no sign of R.O.B. in the actual Super Mario Galaxy games (so we have little clue as to what he'll do in the movie), increasingly it feels like Nintendo's Super Mario Galaxy Movie is less of an actual Mario Galaxy movie than perhaps it first appeared. Outside of introducing Rosalina, recent trailers have leant on characters and worlds from earlier Mario platformers, as well as the more recent Super Mario Odyssey. Oh, and we've seen Yoshi [eating someone and pooping them out as an egg](https://www.ign.com/articles/new-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-finally-shows-yoshi-eating-someone-and-pooping-out-an-egg).

The Super Mario Galaxy Movie stars Brie Larsen as Rosalina and Benny Safdie as Bowser Jr., alongside the returning cast from the first film: Chris Pratt as Mario, Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach, Charlie Day as Luigi, Jack Black as Bowser, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, and Kevin Michael Richardson as Kamek.

Will R.O.B. have a major role in the movie or simply be a two-second cameo? All will be revealed when The Super Mario Galaxy Movie lands in theaters on April 1.
