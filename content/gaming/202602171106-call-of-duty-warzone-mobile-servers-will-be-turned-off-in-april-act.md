Activision has confirmed [Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile](https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile) will go dark on April 17, 2026.

[We already knew](https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-game-closures-and-a-declining-audience-call-of-duty-is-in-a-rough-spot-so-whats-next) that Activision had decided to walk away from Warzone Mobile — the publisher admitted last May that it "unfortunately has not met \[Activision's\] expectations" — but now we have a specific date as to when the smartphone battle royale will be taken offline.

In a brief [statement](https://support.activision.com/warzone-mobile/articles/warzone-mobile-service-changes) posted to its official website, the team thanked players for their "dedication and passion," and said "as a final step in the previously communicated service changes to Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile, the servers for Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile will go offline on April 17, 2026, after which the game will no longer be available for play."

Up until that time, players can still play and "engage with existing content," but refunds are not available for any unused COD Points or previously purchased in-game content, so you're advised to use them up before the game shutdowns in April.

Mobile fans are encouraged to migrate to the free-to-play [Call of Duty: Mobile](https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-mobile) — a different game, albeit with a confusingly similar title — "which offers franchise-favorite game modes, including Battle Royale, Multiplayer, and Zombies, as well as the new extraction-based DMZ: Recon.

"The standalone Call of Duty: Mobile delivers frequent seasonal content updates that include Ranked Play, Events, and the tier-based Battle Pass rewards system offering," the team explained. "Call of Duty: Mobile is available to download through Google Play and Apple’s App Store. Additionally, Call of Duty: Warzone is available on PC and console and is also free to play."

Warzone Mobile launched in March 2024 on iOS and Android as a Warzone-specific Call of Duty mobile experience that offered battle royale for up to 120 players, with cross-progression to the PC and console versions of Warzone, Modern Warfare 2 and 3, and, later in the year, [Black Ops 6](https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6). It struggled right out of the gate, though, and failed to make a mark with "mobile-first players like it has with PC and console audiences," leading to Activision's decision to cull it just a little over a year later.

IGN's [Call of Duty Warzone Mobile review](https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-review) returned an 8/10. We said: "Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile includes all the best elements of Warzone, while speeding up and streamlining matches and using cross-progression to make this a meaningful extension of the traditional experience."
