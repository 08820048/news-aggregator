LG's OLED line is its best, and this Presidents Day, you can save up to 40% off select models. First up, the 77-inch LG OLED C5 is an excellent choice for movies or gaming. This unit supports a 144Hz refresh rate, with features like NVIDIA G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium baked in. PlayStation 5 Pro and Nintendo Switch 2 will be able to make use of these features quite a bit. We gave the C5 [an 8/10 in our review](https://www.ign.com/articles/lg-c5-review), writing, "LG brings all the strengths of modern OLED with the C5: vibrant colors, incredible contrast, and top-tier high refresh rate gaming."

Next, if you're looking for your next feature TV, this 83-inch B5 OLED TV could make an excellent addition to your living room or media room. You've got everything you need to watch the latest movies with Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and Filmmaker Mode support, plus there's also support for a 120Hz refresh rate for gaming. You save $1800 off the B5 this weekend, which is quite a good deal overall.

Finally, the LG 77-inch G5 OLED TV is another great deal, with the model marked $1000 off this weekend. [In our 8/10 review](https://www.ign.com/articles/lg-g5-review), we wrote, "The G5 is excellent at displaying bright, clean, neutral picture quality. Unlike other televisions, saturation and highlights are not overly juiced, so it’s easier to see a game how the developers intended. Shadow balance is outstanding, too, and if you need to boost shadows a bit to make it easier to see what might be hiding there, LG provides that option in its gaming hub via the Black Stabilizer."

## LG QNED TV Presidents Day Deals

Beyond OLED TVs, LG also has five different QNED models on sale. QNED differs from OLED as it uses an LCD panel, which means individual pixels do not emit their own light. Still, these TVs look excellent, and many of these models will look incredible in any room.

You can pick up a 65-inch QNED TV for $699.99 or 86-inch QNED TV for $1299.99. Both of these are great deals for their respective price ranges, as you get the LG webOS platform for navigation and the picture quality LG is known for. The 65-inch model in particular is one of my favorite TVs on sale, as it's discounted $599 and utilizes Mini LED technology.

Another great deal is the 86-inch MiniLED QNED99T, which is an 8K TV! This model normally retails for $3499, but you can pick one up for $2299.99 this weekend. The Mini LED technology also is a plus for high brightness, local dimming, and contrast. You'll get less blooming than with an edge-lit LED TV, which is a necessity for a huge TV like this one.
