Fantagraphics recently kicked off a new line of hardcover graphic novels called Lost Marvels. As the name suggests, these books reprint some of the more obscure, hidden gems in Marvel Comics' vast back catalog. Next up is Lost Marvels No. 3: Savage Tales of the 1980s, and we've got an exclusive preview of a classic story from Wolverine co-creator Herb Trimpe.

Check out the slideshow gallery below for a closer look at Lost Marvels No. 3: Savage Tales of the 1980s:

The original Savage Tales series was the brainchild of editor Larry Hama (G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero), who brought together major Marvel creators like Trimpe, John Severin, and John Buscema to tell darker, grittier adventure stories. This book marks the first time since 1986 that this eight-issue series will be in print.

The full creative lineup on Lost Marvel No. 3 includes artists John Severin, John Buscema, Sam Glanzman, Val Mayerik, Ron Wagner, Gray Morrow, Wayne Vansant, Herb Trimpe, Michael Golden, Joe Jusko, Mary Wilshire, Arthur Suydam, Will Jungkuntz, Vincent Waller, and Ken Steacy, and writers Chuck Dixon, Bill Wray, Don Kraar, Robert Kanigher, Denny O’Neil, Doug Murray, and Archie Goodwin.
