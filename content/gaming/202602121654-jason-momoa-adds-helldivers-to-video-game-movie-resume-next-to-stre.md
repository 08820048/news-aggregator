In his bid to be in every franchise, Jason Momoa strikes again. The star of [_A Minecraft Movie_](https://www.polygon.com/review/551004/minecraft-movie-jack-black-jason-momoa/) (and [_Aquaman_](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24010892/aquaman-lost-kingdom-review/), and [_Supergirl_](https://www.polygon.com/supergirls-composer-change-ramin-djawadi-tom-holkenborg/), and [_Fast X_](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23725992/fast-x-review-fast-furious-10/), and the upcoming [_Street Fighter_)](https://www.polygon.com/street-fighter-2026-movie-release-date-story-cast/) just can't stay busy enough, so he's adding a third video game adaptation to his plate. Momoa will next star in an adaptation of [_Helldivers_](https://www.polygon.com/game/helldivers/14560/) from Sony Pictures and [PlayStation](https://www.polygon.com/playstation/) Studios.

The news comes from [Deadline](https://deadline.com/2026/02/jason-momoa-helldivers-release-date-1236715868/), which reports that Momoa will reunite with _Fast X_ director Justin Lin on the project, with a release date of Nov. 10, 2027. Launched as a PlayStation exclusive in early 2015 — before coming to [PC](https://www.polygon.com/pc/) at the end of the year — _Helldivers_, from [Arrowhead Games](https://www.polygon.com/gaming/599453/helldivers-2-dev-new-game-in-progress/), follows an elite group of soldiers in a battle against alien creatures to save Super Earth, a fictionalized future version of Earth.

A sequel set a hundred years after the first game, [_Helldivers 2_](https://www.polygon.com/game/helldivers-2/40933/), launched on PS5 and PC in early 2024, before coming to [Xbox Series X](https://www.polygon.com/xbox/) last year. Since then, it's sold over [20 million copies across](https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/helldivers-2-sells-20m-copies) its various platforms. When compared to the reported [4 million copies](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/arrowhead-games-we-want-to-be-the-next-from-software-or-blizzard) of the first _Helldivers_, it's hard to overstate the impact the sequel made.

Unlike his other video game adaptation roles, there isn't a specific character for Momoa to play, as _Helldivers_' protagonist is unnamed. In [_A Minecraft Movie_](https://www.polygon.com/analysis/554060/minecraft-movie-ending-explained-plot-hole/), Momoa played an original character and _very_ cool elder gamer, Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison, but co-star Jack Black took on the lead role of Steve, the primary default character from the game. Additionally, a [post-credits scene](https://www.polygon.com/gaming/552514/a-minecraft-movie-post-credit-scenes/) teased the arrival of Alex, a female default character, in the sequel. Meanwhile, Momoa's taking on the iconic role of the mutated [Blanka in the upcoming _Street Fighter_ movie](https://www.polygon.com/street-fighter-movie-trailer-the-game-awards/).

Next, you'll see [Momoa in Supergirl](https://www.polygon.com/supergirl-trailer-jason-momoa-lobo/), though not in the DC universe role you're used to. Momoa hung up Aquaman's trident after last playing the role in 2023's [_The Flash_](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23751219/the-flash-movie-review-ezra-miller-michael-keaton-batman/). In the new James Gunn-led DC Studios films, he's taking on the part of the impossibly cool alien mercenary Lobo. Based on what we've seen thus far in the trailers for _Supergirl_ — he's loud, brash, kills people with a massive hook, and smokes while driving through explosions — he fits the part well.

While you won't be able to see Momoa in the _Helldivers_ movie until Nov. 10, 2027, _Supergirl_ flies into theaters this summer on June 26. Seeing Momoa as the weirdly charismatic baddie Dante in the next Fast & Furious movie — _Fast Forever_ — is going to take some time, though. That movie has been delayed until March 17, 2028.
