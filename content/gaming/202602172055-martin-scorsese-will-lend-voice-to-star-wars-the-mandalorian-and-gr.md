Beloved director Martin Scorcese is getting a small voice cameo role in The Mandalorian and Grogu, as heard in a new trailer released today.

The trailer shows, among other things, Mando and Grogu visiting an Ardennian street food vendor and asking for information while the Ardennian stacks up a sandwich. Mando lays down a coin marked with the New Republic symbol, to which the vendor replies, "Woah! For this price I'll tell you whatever you want!" Mando says he's "looking for a Hutt," which prompts the vendor to immediately slam down the shutter over his stand. "Closed for the night! Thank you!"

That's it for Scorcese, at least in the trailer. His role [was confirmed by the official Star Wars account](https://x.com/starwars/status/2023811131912118493?s=20) on Twitter/X which referenced a popular Scorcese meme: "[absolute cinema](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/absolute-cinema)," the post reads.

The Mandalorian and Grogu is a follow-up to the Disney+ series, The Mandalorian, continuing the story of the titular Mandalorian, Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal), and Grogu (formerly known as Baby Yoda), in the period after the fall of the Galactic Empire. Other cast members include Sigourney Weaver, Jeremy Allen White, and Jonny Coyne. White in particular is voicing Jabba the Hutt's son, who presumably has some feelings given everything that's went down with his dad years prior.

Though a legendary director for films such as Goodfellas, Raging Bull, The Wolf of Wall Street, The Irishman, and _so_ many more, this isn't Scorcese's first voiceover or acting rodeo either. He's appeared in Shark Tale, Killers of the Flower Moon, and a number of other roles including voice work in several of his own films. While in the past, Scorcese has been critical of franchise films, specifically sparking the aforementioned "absolute cinema" meme by stating that Marvel movies were "[not cinema](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/04/the-irishman-director-martin-scorsese-claims-marvel-movies-are-not-cinema)," he has since [clarified his remarks](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/27/martin-scorsese-now-says-marvel-movies-are-a-new-art-form-mcu-disney-the-irishman-james-gunn-samuel-l-jackson-natalie-portman) and appears to have come around on films such as Star Wars, if this appearance is anything to go by.

The Mandalorian and Grogu will arrive in theaters on May 22, 2026.
