## What Do We Expect to See From Today's State of Play?

IGN's Simon Cardy wrote all about [what to expect from today's PlayStation State of Play,](https://www.ign.com/articles/what-to-expect-from-this-weeks-playstation-state-of-play) but we'll recap some of the biggest ones right here as well.

On the PlayStation Studios front, Insomniac Games may have confirmed it _won't_ be at today's show as they responded to someone asking when we'd get more info on [Marvel's Wolverine](https://www.ign.com/games/marvels-wolverine) by saying 'Spring 2026.'

As for what we may see, [Marathon](https://www.ign.com/games/marathon) has good chance of being there as it is set to debut on March 5, as does Housemarque's [Saros.](https://www.ign.com/games/saros) Saros is a bit farther out is it got delayed to April 30, but that's a big one for PlayStation this year.

It would obviously be great to see more from Naughty Dog's [Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet,](https://www.ign.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet) as well as what God of War developer Sony Santa monica is up to! Oh, and some more on Guerrilla Games' [Horizon Hunters Gathering](https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-horizon-hunters-gathering-guerrillas-new-co-op-action-game-for-ps5-and-pc) or the next adventure of Team Asobi's Astro Bot wouldn't hurt either.

On the multiplatform front, many will be clamoring to see [Grand Theft Auto 6](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi&ved=2ahUKEwj9x9ntztSSAxUy78kDHRN7Ha4QFnoECAwQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3yMiWFu1uILG8Jt2iuKA1i) at the State of Play, but it's more likely we'll get another look at [Resident Evil Requiem,](https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem) [Pragmata,](https://www.ign.com/games/pragmata) [Onimusha: Way of the Sword,](https://www.ign.com/games/onimusha-way-of-the-sword) [007 First Light,](https://www.ign.com/games/007-first-light) [LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight,](https://www.ign.com/games/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight) [Crimson Desert,](https://www.ign.com/games/crimson-desert) and/or more. It would also be pretty exciting to learn more about the next chapter of the Final Fantasy VII Remake saga.

There's also [Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra,](https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra) [Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis,](https://www.ign.com/games/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis) [Control: Resonant,](https://www.ign.com/games/control-resonant) [Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser,](https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-galactic-racer) [Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls,](https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls) [Phantom Blade Zero,](https://www.ign.com/games/phantom-blade-zero) [4:Loop,](https://www.ign.com/games/4loop) and many more.
