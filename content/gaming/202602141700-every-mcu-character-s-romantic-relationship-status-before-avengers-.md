Happy Valentine's Day from Earth-616

   ![Steve Rogers and Peggy Carter have their dance](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marvel-couples-_-compilation-6-25-screenshot.png?&fit=crop&w=1600&h=900)Image: Marvel Entertainment

Before [Doctor Doom](https://www.polygon.com/marvel/506586/doctor-doom-mcu-one-world-under-crossover-ryan-north/) arrives and (probably?) starts [stealing babies](https://www.polygon.com/marvel/615924/fantastic-four-post-credits-doomsday-avengers-doctor-doom/) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in Avengers: Doomsday, it’s important for you to know who’s doing the baby-making these days in the MCU. The franchise has gotten extremely complicated over the course of 37 movies and 17 shows, not to mention an entire multiverse of character variants and alternate realities. So keeping track of everyone’s romantic pursuits has become increasingly more challenging. But never fear, if you’re wondering about the relationship status of your favorite Marvel heroes this Valentine’s Day, we’ve got you covered.

Given the nature of various branching realities and the bonkers speculation at play in [_What If…?_](https://www.polygon.com/tv/501626/marvel-what-if-season-3-review/), we’re also going to limit the scope of this to the main Earth-616 universe and the characters from it. (So no, we are not going to talk about how Darcy Lewis and Howard the Duck got married and how she [birthed an egg](https://www.polygon.com/marvel/504425/what-if-best-worst-episode-howard-duck-season-3/).) We’re also going to narrow the scope to more or less just heroes and the occasional villain or anti-hero. We’ll stick to hero names for the most part as well to keep things simple. With that said, here’s a comprehensive breakdown of every MCU character’s totally official relationship status.

## Single and Unavailable

_Loki, White Vision, Rocket Raccoon, Groot, Nebula, Sentry_

Here, we’re looking at characters that either have never expressed an interest in romance whatsoever or who are functionally incapable of it. Groot is a tree and is inherently a nonsexual entity. Full stop. Rocket and Nebula are victims of extreme experimentation that have never really expressed any interest in a romantic partner. It’s possible for them! But highly unlikely. As for Sentry, after [_Thunderbolts\*_](https://www.polygon.com/marvel/566333/thunderbolts-review-marvel-florence-pugh-sebastian-stan/), it’s hard to imagine Bob connecting significantly with anyone when he’s plagued by the Void.

    ![Loki sits holding together the various timelines of the MCU](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/4k-loki-the-finale-_-end-of-time-_-s2e6-ending-_-marvel-studios-_-disney-4-13-screenshot.png?q=49&fit=crop&w=1300&dpr=2)Image: Marvel Entertainment

Heading into _Avengers: Doomsday_, Loki is in an extreme position. Though he had a charming romance with his gender-bent variant Sylvie in _Loki_ season 1, the show mostly moved on from their connection. By the end of season 2, Loki has sacrificed any chance at personal happiness, taking his place at the center of the multiverse as its living anchor. He holds the branching timelines together alone — powerful beyond measure, and completely separated from potential romantic interests.

White Vision is functionally the bleached reanimated corpse of the original, and toward the end of WandaVision, the Vision that Wanda had created inside the Westview Anomaly transferred his memories into that body. It’s a deeply weird situation, but White Vision declared himself to be Vision before flying away. With his Wanda presumably dead after the events of _Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness_, this Vision probably won’t ever find love again, at least not until Marvel reboots the X-Men and we get a new Wanda Maximoff.

## Single and Ready to Mingle

_Winter Soldier, Spider-Man, Daredevil, Ms. Marvel, Valkyrie, Shang-Chi, Kate Bishop, Yelena Belova, Wolverine, The Human Torch, The Thing, Kingo_

Here’s the fun category. Every character listed here is currently single and has dated, flirted, or expressed interest in doing so. Bucky Barnes plays the straight man as the de facto leader of the New Avengers, but don’t forget he tried dating in [_Falcon and the Winter Soldier_](https://www.polygon.com/22333905/falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-captain-america/). He also flirted shamelessly with Sam Wilson’s sister.

   ![spider man and mj far from home](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/spider-man-and-mj-far-from-home.jpg?q=70&fit=crop&w=1280&dpr=1)

MJ and Spider-Man at the end of _Spider-Man: Far From Home_.

Youngsters like Peter Parker and Kamala Khan always seem to be harboring crushes. While Peter may have lost MJ in [_Spider-Man: No Way Home_](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22833733/spider-man-no-way-home-review/), Sadie Sink is playing a mysterious character in the upcoming [_Spider-Man: Brand New Day_](https://www.polygon.com/spider-man-4-brand-new-day-teaser-marvel-movie-new-suit/) — so there’s likely romance in his future.

Valkyrie came across as very flirty in _Thor: Ragnarok_ and is canonically [bisexual](https://www.polygon.com/23205840/thor-love-and-thunder-valkyrie-cheated/). As the king of New Asgard, she seems to take her responsibilities seriously and doesn’t have much time for love, but there’s always a chance. As for [Shang-Chi](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22633102/shang-chi-review/)? He’s got tons of rizz even if he doesn’t really forge any romantic connections. Same deal for Eternals member Kingo.

Though we really don’t know much about the version of Wolverine introduced in [_Deadpool & Wolverine_](https://www.polygon.com/review/24204724/deadpool-and-wolverine-review-mcu-x-men/), Logan is almost always depicted as deeply romantic with many great loves. Jean Grey, Mariko Yashida, Kayla Silverfox, etc. And let’s not forget the scene from X-Men: Days of Future Past when Future Logan is sent back in time to the body of his younger self only to find that he’d just spent the night with a mob boss’ daughter. Likewise, Matt Murdock has had more romantic partners than perhaps any single character in the MCU across three different shows. The Human Torch, aka Johnny Storm, is also canonically girl-crazy, pining after the Silver Surfer in _The Fantastic Four: First Steps_. And his teammate, The Thing always feels a bit desperate for human connection in love — because he’s a sad and lonely rock guy.

   ![johnny storm falling](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/johnny-storm-falling.jpeg?q=49&fit=crop&w=1300&dpr=2)

Here's Johnny Storm literally falling for the Silver Surfer.

Image: Marvel Entertainment

As for Yelena and Kate, who can forget their electric chemistry in the _Hawkeye_ series, which is something I desperately hope we see more of in the MCU moving forward. Even if it’s not romantic between them, their energy is undeniable.

## Single

_Thor, War Machine, Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Kraglin, Doctor Strange, Wong, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Claire Temple, Captain Marvel, Monica Rambeau, Punisher, Okoye, Shuri, Ironheart, Red Guardian, Echo, Ava Starr, Jennifer Kale, Namor, Cassie Lang, America Chavez, Thaddeus Ross, Pepper Potts, Nakia Shauku, Sprite, Thena, Happy Hogan_

There are a lot of characters in the MCU that are just straight-up single (as far as we know). Having lost Jane Foster, Thor is in his sad space dad era. Stephen Strange only ever had eyes for Dr. Christine Palmer, and she’s married now. Drax’s family was killed by Thanos at some point before the MCU even started, and despite a charming dynamic with Mantis at different points over the years, that never developed into anything. None of the other Guardians developed romance either (aside from Quill and Gamora, of course).

We have a few widows here, namely President Thaddeus Ross, Pepper Potts, and Nakia (don’t forget she’s raising T’Challa’s son!). Some of these characters lost the great love of their lives and never really moved on. Others haven’t really been given the screen time or depth to humanize them with romance at all. Which is to say the MCU has a lot of potential to explore more connections moving forward.

## It’s Complicated

   ![she hulk banner son](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/she-hulk-banner-son.jpg?q=70&fit=crop&w=800&dpr=1)

Who is that green boy's mother?

Image: Marvel Entertainment

Bruce Banner had a very complicated relationship with Natasha Romanov through the events depicted in _Avengers: Age of Ultron_, but after Hulk flew into outer space and disappeared for about two years, their romance fizzled out. Things were awkward in _Infinity War_, and perhaps even more awkward after her death in _Endgame_ and the eventual revelation at the end of _She-Hulk: Attorney At Law_ that he sired a son at some point. Who’s the mother?

### She-Hulk & Daredevil

“That's what Hulks do: we smash things,” Jennifer Walters says toward the end of She-Hulk. “Bruce smashes buildings. I smash fourth walls and bad endings…and sometimes [Matt Murdock](https://www.polygon.com/23390785/daredevil-she-hulk-episode-born-again-marvel/)." Walters and Murdock had a charming romance in _She-Hulk: Attorney at Law_ that will probably be left forgotten in the MCU, especially since _Daredevil: Born Again_ remains ongoing. Mark this one as a casual situationship.

### Daredevil & Karen Page

Matt Murdock and Karen Page have a very complicated romantic past, and it’s deeply human. There was always something of a love triangle between them and Foggy Nelson that was grounded in a deep friendship. In the wake of Foggy’s death at the start of _Daredevil: Born Again_, a rift formed between them. Things remain strained, but with a new season starting on March 24, 2026, there’s a chance the romance could rekindle.

### Star-Lord & Gamora

   ![gamora and quill vol 3](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gamora-and-quill-vol-3-1.jpeg?q=49&fit=crop&w=1300&dpr=2)

Gamora and Peter Quill in _Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3_.

Image: Marvel Entertainment

Both living versions of these characters in the MCU are technically single, but there’s no other relationship in the multiverse you could qualify as more complicated. Thanos sacrificed the original Gamora to claim the Soul Stone in _Infinity War_, and even though a new version of Gamora was brought from the past in _Endgame_, it became apparent in [_Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3_](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23702588/guardians-of-the-galaxy-3-review/) that Peter Quill couldn’t force his feelings on her. His Gamora is gone.

### Moon Knight & Scarlet Scarab

On second thought, there _is_ an MCU relationship more complicated than Star-Lord and Gamora, and it’s Moon Knight and Scarlet Scarab. Marc Spector is legally married to Layla El-Faouly, who eventually becomes the Scarlet Scarab, but their relationship survives secrets, separation, and multiple Egyptian gods. Steven Grant, Marc’s alternate identity, also develops feelings for Layla, turning the marriage into something closer to a strange metaphysical love triangle. By the [end of _Moon Knight_](https://www.polygon.com/23056819/moon-knight-ending-explained-credits-scene-layla-scarlet-scarab-jake-lockley/), Marc and Layla reconcile and fight side by side, but the reveal of a third personality leaves their future uncertain (assuming we ever see either of them again in the MCU).

### Deadpool & Vanessa Carlysle

For a character as unhinged as Deadpool, he sure does have a somewhat stable romantic life. Wade Wilson and Vanessa Carlysle survive cancer, assassins, time travel, and at least one detour through the multiverse. When _Deadpool 2_ briefly killed her off, Wade literally rewrote the timeline just to save her. (What’s more romantic than that?) Their relationship was strained by the time _Deadpool & Wolverine_ happened, leading to their separation, but the movie ends on a positive note with Logan encouraging Wade to try and win her back.

## In a Relationship

### Ant-Man & Wasp

Scott Lang and Hope van Dyne had electric chemistry in the first _Ant-Man_, and by the end of its sequel, _Ant-Man and the Wasp_, they emerged as the MCU’s most stable power couple. Through _Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania_ and beyond, their relationship remains strong. Paul Rudd is already confirmed as part of the _Doomsday_ cast, but it remains to be seen whether his scene partner will join him.

### Sersi & Dane Whitman

We probably should list this one as complicated, but emotionally, the love between Sersi, one of the Eternals, and regular guy Dane Whitman seems really stable at the end of _Eternals_. What a bummer that the massive Celestial Arishem the Judge kidnapped Sersi, Kingo, and Phastos. Further complicating this mess, the movie’s post-credits scene sees Whitman about to pick up the Ebony Blade, making him the Black Knight from the comics, while also introducing the vampire Blade offscreen. All of the above makes for the MCU’s biggest dangling plot thread — and it’s one that might never get resolved.

### Phastos & Ben

Speaking of stable relationships to emerge from _Eternals_, during the movie we see that the inventor Phastos is married to a man named Ben. Together they’ve raised a son named Jack. With Phastos abducted, that certainly causes some marital strain, however.

### Druig & Makkari

The one true relationship that survived Eternals unscathed was Druig and Makkari. The two share an on-screen kiss in the movie’s final act and then leave Earth aboard the Domo with Thena to warn other Eternals about the Celestials’ true purpose: seeding worlds with embryos for new Celestials that eventually destroy entire planets.

### Danny Rand & Colleen Wing

   ![iron fist danny rand and colleen wing](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/iron-fist-danny-rand-and-colleen-wing.jpg?q=70&fit=crop&w=1300&dpr=1)

Danny Rand and Colleen Wing in _Iron Fist_.

Image: Marvel Entertainment

One of the few Netflix-era romances that remains canon, Danny Rand and Colleen Wing ended _Iron Fist_ season 2 together — but it’s admittedly a bit complicated. After two seasons of fighting Hand ninjas and grappling with the Iron Fist legacy, Colleen becomes the new Iron Fist, while Danny leaves New York to find his own path. There’s no dramatic breakup or final kiss goodbye, just an open-ended separation, but these kids seem very much in love still.

### Wiccan & Eddie

Wanda Maximoff created twin sons in WandaVision, and somehow Billy used his own reality-warping powers to transfer his and his brother Tommy’s souls into the very real bodies of two boys on the brink of death. In _Agatha All Along_, we eventually learn that Billy inhabits the body of William Kaplan. He falls in love with a boy named Eddie, and though Billy’s identity and sense of self become increasingly more complex throughout the course of the show, it’s safe to assume that he and Eddie remain together.

## Married

### Nick Fury & Priscilla Fury

For a man who built his life on secrets, Nick Fury’s most surprising secret of all is that he has a wife. In _Secret Invasion_, it’s revealed Fury has been married for years to Priscilla, who’s actually a shapeshifting Skrull called Varra. Their relationship involves a lot of espionage and long absences, but it’s also genuine. Fury knew she was a Skrull. She knew the cost of loving him. Even amid a global alien conspiracy, their marriage survives.

### Captain America & Peggy Carter

Ah, now this is the romance we all aspire to, and the happy ending that Cap deserves. After Thanos is defeated and the heroes mourn the loss of Tony Stark at the end of _Avengers: Endgame_, Steve Rogers travels through time to return their borrowed Infinity Stones. But he takes the long way ‘round to come back, starting a new life with Peggy in the past before eventually appearing as an elderly man in the present to give Sam Wilson the Captain America shield. The movie’s final scene shows Steve and Peggy finally getting that dance he owed her for all those years. A recent [teaser for _Doomsday_](https://www.polygon.com/chris-evans-steve-rogers-avengers-doomsday-teaser/) even confirms that the two now have a baby.

### Hawkeye & Laura Barton

Despite the tragedy of having to watch his entire family turn to dust, Clint Barton eventually enjoyed a quiet retirement as a family man after _Endgame_ — after five years killing criminals as Ronin. He had to pick up the bow again in the _Hawkeye_ series for a brief stint but has passed the torch on to Kate Bishop as the new Hawkeye now. In a franchise full of tragic love stories, the Bartons are quietly bulletproof.

### Hank Pym & Janet van Dyne

The MCU’s longest-running marriage survived a Quantum Realm disappearance, the Snap, and decades of secrets. In _Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania_, Janet’s hidden past with Kang strains their relationship, but it doesn’t break it. Hank and Janet argue, reconcile, and fight side by side like seasoned partners. They may be retired from frontline heroics, but they remain one of the MCU’s most stable couples.

### U.S. Agent & Olivia Walker

John Walker’s redemption arc may be messy, but his marriage isn’t. Introduced in _The Falcon and the Winter Soldier_, Olivia Walker stands by him even after his very public fall from grace. As he transitions into his new role as U.S. Agent, she remains supportive and steady opposite his volatility. It’s not flashy, but it’s functional. In a universe of gods and super-soldiers, sometimes the most radical thing is a spouse who simply stays.

### Kingpin & Vanessa Fisk

   ![kingpin and vanessa](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/kingpin-and-vanessa.jpeg?q=70&fit=crop&w=1300&dpr=1)

Wilson and Vanessa Fisk in _Daredevil: Born Again_ share a tender look at one another.

Image: Marvel Entertainment

Somehow, it’s very easy to hear the way Wilson Fisk says his wife’s name “Vanessa…” with a growl. If love languages include organized crime and political consolidation, Wilson and Vanessa Fisk are hashtag-thriving. Their relationship is intense, loyal, and morally pitch-black. Vanessa ultimately orchestrates Foggy Nelson’s murder to protect their empire, cementing them as one of the MCU’s most united (and most dangerous) married couples.

### Mr. Fantastic & The Invisible Woman

The marriage at the heart of Marvel’s first family is, oddly enough, one of its newest. 2025’s _Fantastic Four: First Steps_ begins four years after Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Ben Grimm, and Johnny Storm became the Fantastic Four thanks to exposure to cosmic radiation. Reed and Sue are already married, and they announce Sue’s pregnancy early on. So the movie drops us into a partnership that’s already tested by fame, danger, and Reed’s scientific ambition. Sue is the emotional center of the team and balances Reed’s cosmic-scale thinking with something far more grounded. In a cinematic universe that often tears couples apart, the MCU’s Reed and Sue are defined by their commitment — to each other, their child, and their entire family.
