Contractor management platform Mellow has launched a support program for indie developers to reduce operational costs.

Mellow's Indie Launchpad includes the company's Contractor Management platform, which covers hiring, contracting, legal paperwork, and invoicing.

It is offering six months of full access to its Indie Launchpad, which will enable indie studios to "hire and work with remote talent across more than 100 countries worldwide."

The program is "intended for aspiring studios" of up to 15 people across desktop, mobile, and web development.

Mellow aims to support up to 50 indie studios through this program and will accept applications through 2026. Full access is provided "at a symbolic $1 per contractor per month for legal formalities."

Developers that would like to participate in the program [can do so here](https://mellow.io/contractor-of-record/indie-launchpad).

Mellow shared internal data showing that operational overhead accounts for 5% to 15% of studio budgets. It also found that manual contractor management costs indie studios between 100 and 300 hours and $5,000 and $15,000 per quarter for administrative work.

"Working closely with numerous indie studios, we've seen firsthand the heavy financial pressure they face. In today's volatile market, it's only getting harder," said Mellow VP of growth Alexander Norovyatkin.

"We cannot change market turbulence, but we can provide a safe space where studios can manage their teams, eliminate paperwork, and reduce administrative costs. Our goal is to free up resources for what matters most: creating new worlds."
