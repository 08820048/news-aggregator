Thank your own personal deity--possibly Athena of _God of War: Sons of Sparta_ fame--it's Friday. Some sales are noisy. This one is curated. These are games I have played, finished, stress tested, and would still recommend at these prices without hesitation. And now I'm off to play some Resi. Weekend well. See you Monday.

## **This Day in Gaming 🎂**

In retro news, I'm celebrating the 23rd birthday of **Rez**, Tetsuya Mizuguchi's synesthesia masterpiece. One part **Panzer Dragoon** on-rails shooting and another part LSD degrees of "ohhh, I can _seeee_ the muuuusic," this Dreamcast must-own stands up today, particularly inside of a PS VR2 headset.

## Nice Savings for Nintendo Switch

[

-   [Red Dead Redemption](https://www.amazon.com.au/Red-Dead-Redemption-CIB-Switch/dp/B0FMD74GMR?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-48%) - **A$25.00** The writing is still razor sharp and the world holds up surprisingly well on Switch. Gunplay shows its age, yet the pacing and tone remain worth every cent.
-   [Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope](https://www.amazon.com.au/Mario-plus-Rabbids-Sparks-of-Hope/dp/B0B5LSVNKP?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-40%) - **A$47.80** Tactical combat without rigid grids gives this sequel real personality. The Rabbids humour can grate, but the systems underneath are smarter than they look.
-   [Dead Cells](https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000007705) (-50%) - **A$18.70** Still one of the tightest action loops around. It is punishing but fair, and every run feels earned. At half price, it is dangerously easy to justify.
-   [Unravel Two](https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000015566) (-70%) - **A$8.90** A gentle co-op puzzle platformer built around coordination rather than chaos. It is short and simple, yet quietly charming at this price point.
-   [Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered](https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000029275) (-80%) - **A$11.90** Loud arcade racing that knows exactly what it is. Structure is old school, but the chases still feel good and the discount softens repetition.

Or gift a [**Nintendo eShop Card**](https://zdcs.link/V0MbJ?object_uuid=73b5a948-8476-4bd5-ab5e-04d383c9a986&t=article).

## Exciting Bargains for Xbox

[

](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/11/16/ac-mirage-1700094378357.png)

-   [Assassin's Creed Mirage](https://www.amazon.com.au/Assassins-Creed-Mirage/dp/B0BDRK6JHY?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-70%) - **A$24** Mirage trims the RPG excess and restores rooftop stalking. Smaller scope works in its favour, especially at this price.
-   [Sonic Frontiers](https://www.amazon.com.au/Sonic-Frontiers/dp/B0BBRZMFDD?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-66%) - **A$33.70** Ambitious open zones give Sonic room to breathe. It is uneven, but the spectacle and soundtrack carry more weight than expected.
-   [Hogwarts Legacy](https://www.amazon.com.au/Hogwarts-Legacy/dp/B08JQMCVV2?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-65%) - **A$39** Hogwarts itself is absurdly detailed and worth exploring slowly. The main story drags occasionally, but the fantasy rarely falters.
-   [Call of Duty: Black Ops 7](https://www.amazon.com.au/Call-of-Duty-Black-Ops-7/dp/B0FMXW3BGT?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-33%) - **A$55.90** Predictable but polished, with campaign set pieces that still flex technical muscle. Multiplayer value depends entirely on your squad staying active.
-   [Mortal Kombat 1](https://www.amazon.com.au/Mortal-Kombat-1/dp/B0C5S85H6K?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-62%) - **A$29** Visceral and visually absurd in motion. Live service elements divide opinion, but the core fighting remains satisfyingly sharp.

**Xbox One**

-   [Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy](https://www.amazon.com.au/Marvels-Guardians-of-the-Galaxy/dp/B09CZT15ZP?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-51%) - **A$49.10** Combat repeats itself, yet the writing and cast chemistry carry the experience comfortably at this discount.
-   [Mass Effect Legendary Edition](https://www.amazon.com.au/Mass-Effect-Legendary-Edition/dp/B08PLH2349?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-70%) - **A$30.30** Three sprawling RPGs and almost all DLC in one package. The first game shows its age, but the character work remains elite.
-   [LEGO Worlds](https://www.amazon.com.au/LEGO-Worlds/dp/B01N2QSE4X?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-42%) - **A$28.90** Freeform creativity with minimal structure. It lacks modern LEGO polish, though younger builders will not mind at this price.

Or just invest in an [**Xbox Card**](https://zdcs.link/glwRb?object_uuid=73b5a948-8476-4bd5-ab5e-04d383c9a986&t=article).

## **Pure Scores for PlayStation**

[

](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/04/codthumb-1770230343966.png)

-   [CoD: Black Ops 7](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B0FMXW8HQF?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-64%) - **A$40** Faster load times and steady performance help here. It does not reinvent anything. CoD is CoD. You know this.
-   [Crimson Desert](https://www.amazon.com.au/Crimson-Desert-Day-One-PlayStation/dp/B0FSQFV4VM?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-19%) - **A$89** Large scale combat and open world ambition headline this one. It is not a small investment, but early scope looks substantial.
-   [Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales](https://www.amazon.com.au/Marvels-Spider-Man-Miles-Morales/dp/B08RFC9DRQ?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-48%) - **A$48.90** Shorter than the original, tighter because of it. Swinging across New York still feels clean and confident.
-   [Alan Wake II](https://www.amazon.com.au/Alan-Wake-2-Deluxe-PS5/dp/B0D69Z7SQR?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-44%) - **A$50.30** A bold horror sequel that trusts you to keep up. Combat can feel deliberate, but the structure and atmosphere linger.
-   [Assassin's Creed Shadows](https://www.amazon.com.au/Assassins-Creed-Shadows/dp/B0D44YLP3H?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-55%) - **A$49** Dual protagonists and feudal Japan finally align. Open world fatigue is possible, yet the setting does heavy lifting.

**PS4**

-   [Trials of Mana](https://www.amazon.com.au/Trials-of-Mana/dp/B07XMG7JVM?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-44%) - **A$43.20** A bright remake that keeps its classic bones. Story is simple, but the combat system retains genuine charm.
-   [It Takes Two](https://store.playstation.com/en-au/product/EP0006-PPSA02343_00-ITTAKESTWORETAIL) (-80%) - **A$11.90** One of the smartest co-op designs in years. You will need a reliable partner, which is sometimes the real challenge.
-   [Disco Elysium - The Final Cut](https://store.playstation.com/en-au/product/EP6757-PPSA03329_00-0902745586622586) (-75%) - **A$14.90** Dialogue as combat, and still unmatched. It is dense and uncompromising, but essential at this price.

Or purchase a [**PS Store Card.**](https://zdcs.link/kn6Ww?object_uuid=73b5a948-8476-4bd5-ab5e-04d383c9a986&t=article)

## Purchase Cheap for PC

[

](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/07/snakethumb-1762555245224.png)

-   [Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater](https://zdcs.link/9l8wv0?object_uuid=73b5a948-8476-4bd5-ab5e-04d383c9a986&t=article) (-53%) - **A$54.90** A stealth classic rebuilt with modern presentation. Pacing is theatrical, but jungle tension still grips.
-   [It Takes Two](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1426210/It_Takes_Two) (-80%) - **A$9.90** Runs beautifully on PC and remains a co-op benchmark. You do need someone equally committed on the other controller.
-   [Death Stranding Director's Cut](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850570/DEATH_STRANDING_DIRECTORS_CUT/) (-75%) - **A$13.70** A strange, contemplative trek about connection and cargo. It commits fully to its tone, which is precisely why it works.
-   [Metaphor: ReFantazio](https://zdcs.link/aD8VNW?object_uuid=73b5a948-8476-4bd5-ab5e-04d383c9a986&t=article) (-55%) - **A$51.70** Persona lineage meets high fantasy politics. It is dense and stylish, though newcomers should expect a long commitment.
-   [Spiritfarer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/972660/Spiritfarer_Farewell_Edition) (-85%) - **A$6.50** Gentle management wrapped around grief and goodbyes. It moves slowly, but the emotional payoff is quietly powerful.

Or just get a [**Steam Wallet Card**](https://zdcs.link/vdlm8?object_uuid=73b5a948-8476-4bd5-ab5e-04d383c9a986&t=article)
