The most brooding Spidey of them all makes his debut

Our first real look at the [Spider-Man Noir live-action show](https://www.polygon.com/23592796/spider-man-noir-live-action-series-amazon/) is here. Amazon just released a pair of trailers for _Spider-Noir_, which premieres May 27 on Prime Video. (It's the same trailer, just released in both "[authentic black and white](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgMbkitzhEM&feature=youtu.be)" to mimic a period noir film, and "[True-Hue Color](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-Blr0_koQA&feature=youtu.be)" to mimic a colorized version of a noir classic. The show itself will similarly be released in both versions.) The Spider-Verse spin-off, starring Nicolas Cage in live action as a 1930s private investigator, channels classic film noir with a dose of [_Sin City_](https://www.polygon.com/2015/10/9/9488345/frank-miller-confirms-new-sin-city/) — especially if you watch it in the black-and-white version.

The trailer introduces Cage as Ben Reilly, who becomes a crime-fighting vigilante. While this first look is light on plot details, it also introduces the rest of the cast, which includes:

-   **Lamorne Morris as Robbie Robertson**, a journalist and Ben's close friend
-   **Li Jun Li as Cat Hardy**, the requisite femme fatale: a nightclub singer with ties to organized crime
-   **Karen Rodriguez as Janet**, Ben's secretary
-   **Brendan Gleeson as Silvermane**, a mob boss with a connection to Ben

In addition to showing off Cage's talent for playing unhinged characters, the trailer also offers some classic Spider-Man web-slinging, confirming that _Spider-Noir_ won't deviate too far from the classic formula. That said, it also offers up a dark subversion of Spidey's catchphrase: "With _no_ power comes _no_ responsibilities."

Excitement for _Spider-Noir_ has been slowly ramping up since it was first announced in 2023, but now that excitement has reached a fever pitch. Only recently did we get solid confirmation — via a constructed setup design [advertising _Spider-Noir_ in the halls of CCXP](https://collider.com/spider-noir-poster-nicolas-cage-playing-ben-reilly-not-peter-parker/) — that Noir's alter ego wouldn't be Peter Parker, but "B. Reilly." In previous iterations, Noir is meant to be a grizzled, down-on-his-luck, deeply cynical variant of Parker. But it looks like showrunner Oren Uziel is taking this show somewhere different.

We've had a great run with Tom Holland's take on Spider-Man, and not enough positive things can be said about _[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse](https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/28/18105326/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-review),_ but fans have been champing at the bit for a new live-action Spider-Man that offers something fresh. And from the looks of this latest trailer, Nicolas Cage's _Spider-Noir_ is set to deliver.
