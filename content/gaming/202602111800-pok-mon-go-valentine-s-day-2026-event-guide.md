[_Pokémon Go_](https://www.polygon.com/game/pokemon-go/38713)’s "**Valentine's Day 2026**" event runs from **Feb. 10-15**, features a bunch of paired-up or pink Pokémon, and brings back the crown-wearing versions of Nidoqueen and Nidoking to raids.

The event also features doubled XP for catching Pokémon, doubled Stardust from opening gifts, and a global challenge that'll reward Spinda Timed Research, extra XP on curveball catches, and a chance to get Rare Candy from gifts. Additionally, any Kirlia evolved into Gardevoir or Gallade during this event will know its legacy move, **Synchronoise**.

Notably during this event, you can change your **[Furfrou's trim](https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/22686412/furfrou-forms-change-form-event-trims-heart-matron-dandy-debutante-diamond-star-la-reine-kabuki/) to the heart form**, so you should do that if you don't have one already.

While it's not technically part of this event, remember that **Therian Forme Enamorus Raid Day** will take place on Feb. 14 from 2-5 p.m. in your local time. During that period, Furfrou and Luvdisc will have increased shiny chances from raids, so keep that in mind if you're hunting down a special Furfrou.

We list the other perks for _Pokémon Go_'s "Valentine's Day 2026" event below, including the Field Research, shiny boosts, and spawns.
