[Magic: The Gathering](https://www.ign.com/games/magic-the-gathering-trading-card-game) launched its first set of 2026, [Lorwyn Eclipsed](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-lorwyn-eclipsed-where-to-buy-updated-2026), and early signs are it’s a great return to in-universe cards.

As we do regularly, we’re looking at how the latest set has affected pricing across the cardboard game we love so much, leaning on data from our friends at [TCGplayer](https://www.tcgplayer.com/content/article/The-Biggest-Price-Spikes-in-Magic-The-Gathering-This-Week-01-24-2026/94235908-d3d2-4a36-931c-f99edfc5e342/). Spoiler alert: Black and Blue cards are in vogue this season, it seems.

## Climbers

Kicking off with an Elemental that makes for a nifty inclusion for upgrading the Dance of the Elementals precon, [Sunderflock](https://zdcs.link/QxeJVx?object_uuid=37160cad-2b22-47ae-a26e-e4b6224cef84&t=article) is a nine-cost card that gets cheaper the more Elementals you have in play.

### Sunderflock

It also puts non-Elementals back in their owners’ hands, and is a 5/5 with Flying for good measure. It’s selling for around $10, having gone for (according to TCGplayer data) a single cent in recent months.

[![Eddymurk Crab](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/06/eddymurk-crab-1770375799425.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/z7R6AG?object_uuid=37160cad-2b22-47ae-a26e-e4b6224cef84&t=article "Eddymurk Crab")

### Eddymurk Crab

Next up, [Eddymurk Crab](https://zdcs.link/z7R6AG?object_uuid=37160cad-2b22-47ae-a26e-e4b6224cef84&t=article). Another Elemental (Crab), this one has Flash and costs less to cast for instants and sorceries in your graveyard. It also taps target creatures and is a 5/5 in its own right. It’s sitting at under a dollar right now, but has spiked from being worth next to nothing not long ago.

[![Doomsday Excruciator](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/06/doomsday-excruciator-1770375810870.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/9wBVbb?object_uuid=37160cad-2b22-47ae-a26e-e4b6224cef84&t=article "Doomsday Excruciator")

### Doomsday Excruciator

Moving from Blue to Black, and Elementals to something a little more demonic, [Doomsday Excruciator](https://zdcs.link/9wBVbb?object_uuid=37160cad-2b22-47ae-a26e-e4b6224cef84&t=article) is a card that’s “spiked” to around two dollars. Not a lot, sure, but this six-cost, 6/6 with Flying was half of that last week. It exiles all but six of everyone’s cards, and dares you to finish a match more quickly by giving you an extra draw.

[![Insatiable Avarice](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/06/insatiable-avarice-1770375821793.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/922XOE?object_uuid=37160cad-2b22-47ae-a26e-e4b6224cef84&t=article "Insatiable Avarice")

### Insatiable Avarice

Pairing nicely with that is [Insatiable Avarice](https://zdcs.link/922XOE?object_uuid=37160cad-2b22-47ae-a26e-e4b6224cef84&t=article), which forces a player to lose life and draw three cards. This one is up to around $15 at the time of writing, but was $2 just a couple of weeks ago.

[![Harvester of Misery](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/06/harvester-of-misery-1770375830933.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/QOjMpn?object_uuid=37160cad-2b22-47ae-a26e-e4b6224cef84&t=article "Harvester of Misery")

### Harvester of Misery

[Harvester of Misery](https://zdcs.link/QOjMpn?object_uuid=37160cad-2b22-47ae-a26e-e4b6224cef84&t=article) jumped from $3 to around $18 (with some sellers shipping it for much more). This 5/4 with Menace dishes out -2/-2 to other creatures, and that might be enough to trigger a big with the Blight Curse precon.

## Crashers

Now that Lorwyn has been released, we’ve got a few Crashers from the latest set that are worth a pickup.

[![Hexing Squelcher](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/06/hexing-squelcher-1770375922643.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/aA8rNw?object_uuid=37160cad-2b22-47ae-a26e-e4b6224cef84&t=article "Hexing Squelcher")

### Hexing Squelcher

Everyone went mad for [Hexing Squelcher](https://zdcs.link/aA8rNw?object_uuid=37160cad-2b22-47ae-a26e-e4b6224cef84&t=article), with the Goblin Sorcerer preventing counters and dishing out Ward. It’s not around $18, down from $50 before launch.

[![Spinerock Tyrant](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/06/spinerock-tyrant-1770375942378.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/aN3yq2?object_uuid=37160cad-2b22-47ae-a26e-e4b6224cef84&t=article "Spinerock Tyrant")

### Spinerock Tyrant

Another big drop is the 6/6 dragon, [Spinerock Tyrant](https://zdcs.link/aN3yq2?object_uuid=37160cad-2b22-47ae-a26e-e4b6224cef84&t=article). It deals damage as -1/-1 (making it a Blighter’s dream), and doubles up spells. Now, it’s under $3, having been close to $30 at pre-launch prices.

[![Curious Colossus](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/06/curious-colossus-1770375951096.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/aD80NW?object_uuid=37160cad-2b22-47ae-a26e-e4b6224cef84&t=article "Curious Colossus")

### Curious Colossus

Sticking with big numbers, [Curious Colossus](https://zdcs.link/aD80NW?object_uuid=37160cad-2b22-47ae-a26e-e4b6224cef84&t=article) is a 7/7 that makes everyone else’s creature a 1/1. If you can pair that with a Massacre Wurm or something similar, you can board wipe an entire table in the late game. It’s now under $3.

[![Ashling, Rekindled](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/06/ashling-rekindled-1770375961082.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/av8bkE?object_uuid=37160cad-2b22-47ae-a26e-e4b6224cef84&t=article "Ashling, Rekindled")

### Ashling, Rekindled

Finally, [Ashling, Rekindled](https://zdcs.link/av8bkE?object_uuid=37160cad-2b22-47ae-a26e-e4b6224cef84&t=article) is a 1/3 that transforms into Ashling, Rimebound to generate more mana. It’s a cheap card in terms of mana cost, but it’s now just $2 - down from $15.
