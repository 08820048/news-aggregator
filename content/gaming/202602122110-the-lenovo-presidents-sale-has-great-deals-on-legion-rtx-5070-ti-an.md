Lenovo is kicking off its [Presidents Day sale](https://zdcs.link/QOjGo2?object_uuid=18d8d5d5-ccb7-4756-a74c-771caa9d3087&t=article) this week, and it looks like gamers haven't been forgotten. The deals prioritize quality over quantity, because while there are really only three major gaming desktop that are on sale, the prices are competitive with the ones I saw during Black Friday.

With the [rising prices of GPUs and RAM](https://www.ign.com/articles/2026-is-going-to-suck-for-pc-gaming), you don't want to miss out on this rare opportunity to score a hefty discount on an RTX 5070 Ti or RTX 5080 GPU.

## Lenovo Legion Tower 5 RTX 5070 Ti Gaming PC for $1,860

First on the list is a Lenovo Legion Tower 5 Gen 10 GeForce RTX 5070 Ti gaming PC, which drops down to just $1,859.99 after you apply two stackable coupon codes: "**EXTRAFIVE**" and "**BUYMORELENOVO**". That's a total of $1,530 in savings.

Something to note is that this PC is equipped with an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU on a customized Intel HM870 mATX motherboard. The 275HX is traditionally a laptop CPU, and laptop CPUs are permanently soldered onto the motherboard. That means you won't be able to swap out the CPU for a better one in the future. If you don't intend on swapping the CPU (and let's face it, most of us who buy prebuilts probably never will), then you'll get excellent performance out of this chip.

The [RTX 5070 Ti](https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-review) offers the best bang for your buck amongst the new Nvidia Blackwell cards in terms of 4K gaming performance. It performs neck-and-neck with the previous generation [RTX 4080 Super](https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-super-review) and pulls ahead in any game that supports multi-frame generation, especially with the [recent DLSS 4.5 update](https://in.ign.com/tech/251831/feature/nvidia-here-is-why-i-chose-team-green-and-how-dlss-45-and-its-2nd-gen-transformer-model-changed-my-g). Since the RTX 5070 Ti GPU is non-existent as a standalone card, the only way to get one without paying a ridiculous markup is by getting a prebuilt computer.

If you don't like the idea of a soldered-on CPU, Lenovo is offering a noteworthy deal on another 5070 Ti gaming PC. This time it's equipped with a desktop-class Intel Core Ultra 9 285K processor. This is Intel's best consumer CPU at the moment, featuring a max turbo frequency of 5.6GHz and a whopping 24 cores, excelling at any task. This is a pricier configuration at $1,990, but the superior, upgradeable CPU isn't the only perk that you get. The system is housed in a roomier Legion Tower 7 chassis that includes more fans for airflow and an enthusiast-grade 360mm AIO liquid cooler.

## Lenovo Legion Tower 7 RTX 5080 Gaming PC for $2,370

Lenovo notes that this "doorbuster" deal is nearly sold out. That's not surprising, since this is one of the better prices I've seen this year for an RTX 5080 gaming PC. Technically, [Alienware has an even less expensive RTX 5080 config for $2,180](https://www.ign.com/articles/alienware-aurora-geforce-rtx-5080-gaming-pc-deal-dell-presidents-day-sale), but the Lenovo prebuilt is much better equipped. It features a liquid-cooled Intel Core Ultra 9 258K CPU, GeForce RTX 5080 16GB GPU, 32GB of DDR5-5600MHz RAM, and a 2TB SSD.

The GeForce RTX 5080 will set you up for 4K gaming for at least a few years. It's one of the [fastest cards on the market](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-graphics-card), bested only by the $2,000 RTX 5090 and the discontinued $1,600 RTX 4090. This is a phenomenal card for playing the latest, most demanding games in 4K resolution at high settings and ray tracing enabled. The recent [DLSS 4.5 update](https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidias-dlss-45-is-here-with-better-image-quality-now-and-6x-multi-frame-generation-coming-soon) has further optimized multi-frame gen and upscaling so you can push really high framerates even in 4K.
