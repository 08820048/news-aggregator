Presidents Day may not be one of the [biggest sales of the year](https://www.ign.com/articles/all-upcoming-sales-events), but it _is_ one of the first. Pretty much every major retailer will have some sort of sale this weekend and Amazon has already launched its own. And although the discounts don't look quite as inviting as you'd expect from a Prime Day or a Black Friday sale, right now is still a pretty good time to find some savings.

Amazon has had various sales going on in the lead-up to Valentine's Day, but today is the first day the official [**Presidents Day sale page has gone live**](https://zdcs.link/98A4pq?object_uuid=e1b93a1f-a313-419c-a7e4-0a567e79fc11&t=article). Some of the featured deals include an Apple Watch, Beats wireless headphones, and various household appliances.

## The Amazon Presidents Day Sale Is Live for 2026

### Amazon Presidents Day Sale

See all of today's featured deals.

Amazon's Presidents Day sale will run from now until actual Presidents Day, which lands on February 16 this year. You'll be able to find all of the discounts via Amazon's official landing page, which can be sorted by all categories to find what you're looking for. The only thing you won't find on this page is a specific tab for coupons. For whatever reason, any time Amazon switches from its regular deals landing page to a specific event one, it always makes its [coupons harder to find](https://www.ign.com/wikis/amazon-prime/How_to_Find_Amazon_Coupons).

### There's a buy 1, get 1 half off sale

One such promotion you _won't_ find featured on this landing page is Amazon's ['Buy 2, get 1 50%' off sale](https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-has-a-buy-1-get-1-half-price-sale-on-4k-blu-ray-movies-board-games-february-2026) it kicked off earlier this week. That promo includes books, 4K movies, and even some popular board games. It's definitely worth checking out if you're hoping to save on a [Valentine's Day gift](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-valentines-day-gift-ideas-for-2026) ahead of Saturday.

### Do you need to be an Amazon Prime member to shop the sale?

Unlike some of [Amazon's exclusive sales events](https://www.ign.com/wikis/amazon-prime/Exclusive_Sales_Events), **you don't need to have a Prime membership to access the savings**. You do still need an Amazon account to actually buy anything, but the majority of the discounts are for anyone. There are, of course, still some Prime-exclusive coupons that are only available to Prime members, but those will be clearly marked.

If you want to grab an Amazon Prime membership before you do some shopping, there is currently a [30-day free trial available](https://www.ign.com/wikis/amazon-prime/Free_Trials) for new subscribers. There are quite a few benefits to a subscription, but the most important ones are access to fast and free shipping and Amazon's [Prime Video streaming service](https://www.ign.com/wikis/prime-video). With Amazon just wrapping up [season 2 of Fallout](https://www.ign.com/wikis/fallout-tv-series/Season_2_Episodes), now is a great time to grab a free trial and binge the whole season while enjoying the shopping benefits.
