Details on the upcoming, PlayStation-published [Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls](https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls) have appeared online, just days ahead of [this week's big State of Play broadcast](https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-playstation-state-of-play-broadcast-for-this-week).

The highly-anticipated Marvel fighting game will feature 20 characters at launch, and also include a single-player "Episode Mode." That's according to a Steam page description of the game briefly seen before it was pulled (but not before the leak was spotted and shared on [social media](https://x.com/Wario64)).

Marvel Tokon's roster is described as "expanding" — so it sounds like we should expect further heroes from the Marvel universe to turn up in future.

Online, there's mention of 64-player online lobbies, including standard VS modes. PC players will require a PlayStation account, meanwhile.

Developed by Guilty Gear Strive maker Arc System Works, the game has currently been announced for PlayStation 5 and PC with a vague "2026" launch window. But the timing of this week's leak, just days ahead of Sony's hour-long State of Play showcase, suggests we may hear more on all of that pretty soon.

Currently, only eight characters have been officially confirmed for the game: Captain America (Steve Rogers), Doctor Doom, Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes), Iron Man, Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan), Spider-Man (Peter Parker), Star-Lord and Storm. We'd bet this number will grow in the next few days...

"Assemble your team of legendary Marvel characters in the ultimate 4v4 tag team fighter from PlayStation Studios, Arc System Works and Marvel Games," the game's leaked description read. "It's time to build your dream team and break some spirits in blistering 4v4 fighting action. Choose from an expanding roster of 20 iconic Marvel characters at launch, each rendered in a bold new anime-inspired art style and members of their own unique teams of equally impressive heroes and villains.

"Experiment with team compositions to discover new combos, synergies, and strategies. Blast your way through dynamic stages based on iconic Marvel Universe locales, some featuring interactive stage transitions. Fighting is both immersive and intuitive, with a range of unique move sets, combos, and strategies to master. Adjustable controls, both traditional and quick inputs, plus easy chain combos make diving right in a breeze.

"Face off against a friend locally or join the fray with up to 64 players in the online\* lobby, including standard VS modes. Plus, dive deep on each team with the single player Episode Mode to learn more about team dynamics and lore. Internet connection and account for PlayStation required."

Sony is set to hold its State of Play this Thursday, February 12 at 2pm Pacific / 5pm Eastern / 10pm UK time — and as ever, IGN will be reporting live.
