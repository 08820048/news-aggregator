Plus, you get solid ergonomics, a colorful 120Hz IPS display, and Windows.

### Donkey Kong Bananza - Nintendo Switch 2

The Amazon-owned Woot has Donkey Kong Bananza for only $59.99 today. Prime members can even enjoy free shipping. This [best game of 2025](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-game-of-2025) runner-up is rarely on sale, so it’s nice to see about $10 taken off the price tag. Earning a rare 10/10 rating in [our review](https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review), Logan Plant even went on to say, “Donkey Kong Bananza is a truly groundbreaking 3D platformer, with satisfying movement, powerful abilities, impressive destructible environments, and clever challenges that all come together in complete harmony to create Nintendo’s first Switch 2 masterpiece.”

## Refurbished Ninja Luxe Café 3-in-1 Espresso, Drip Coffee, and Cold Brew Machine

Refurbished

### Ninja Luxe Café 3-in-1 Espresso, Drip Coffee and Cold Brew Machine

My favorite semi-automatic espresso machine I’ve ever reviewed, the Ninja Luxe Café 3-in-1 Espresso, Drip Coffee and Cold Brew Machine, is only $249.99 at the Amazon-owned Woot, and Prime members enjoy free shipping. It’s a refurbished model but comes with a 90-day limited warranty for added peace of mind. The same machine is going for $599 new or $449.49 for a refurbished model on [Amazon](https://zdcs.link/QrJddE?object_uuid=02c286ba-8e7c-444e-b450-deff0b57ff02&t=article) right now, meaning you’re in for some epic savings.

I absolutely love this machine, as it's great for beginners who are just getting into espresso. It automatically tells you of the ideal grind settings, grinds the perfect amount of coffee beans into the portafilter, and then brews a solid espresso. It can even steam and froth milk to your liking for coffeehouse drinks at home. It’s not only espresso, this machine also brews individual cups of drip coffee of various sizes; all that's required is a grind size setting change.
