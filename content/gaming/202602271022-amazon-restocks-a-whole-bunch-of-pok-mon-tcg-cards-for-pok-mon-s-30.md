There's a whole bunch of great [Pokémon deals](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-day-deals-2026) available right now online as part of Pokémon Day and the 30th Anniversary celebrations. That includes [Pokémon TCG](https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-full-release-schedule-2026) as well, with Amazon going through something of a massive restocking mission this week, and at just the right time.

The biggest highlights from Amazon's selection include the Journey Together Booster Bundle, now back in stock, and scoring a sizable reduction. It's now just [$34.97 at Amazon](https://zdcs.link/QLp88b?object_uuid=7445e5bc-c2e9-45b1-a816-e4d312e34bac&t=article), but I can see these selling out _fast_ today, so snap one up ASAP.

[Ascended Heroes - Elite Trainer Box](https://zdcs.link/Qb8xdJ?object_uuid=7445e5bc-c2e9-45b1-a816-e4d312e34bac&t=article), now available and in stock for trainers, matching market price at $119,99 as well, alongside the [Pokémon Day 2026 Collection](https://zdcs.link/QV5X2x?object_uuid=7445e5bc-c2e9-45b1-a816-e4d312e34bac&t=article), which, considering the ongoing 30th anniversary celebration, should absolutely be at the top of your buy list right now.

This [features a specially stamped foil Pikachu promo card](https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-30th-anniversary-tcg-collection-where-to-buy-updated), a metallic coin featuring the 30th anniversary logo, and a random variety of three booster packs from Phantasmal Flames and Mega Evolution.

While the stamped foil promo card of Pikachu isn’t a unique illustration, its status as the first official 30th-anniversary product might be worth something to completionists in a few years. I’d recommend picking up two if you’ve got the space - one to hold onto as an investment, one to rip.

You can also secure both of these at TCGplayer right now at slightly reduced prices (without considering delivery), but I'll leave it up to you to decide where you want to buy today.

Beyond the headliners, it’s also worth flagging last year’s Prismatic Evolution-themed [Pokémon Day 2025 collection](https://zdcs.link/ak1K3X?object_uuid=7445e5bc-c2e9-45b1-a816-e4d312e34bac&t=article), which Amazon has quietly restocked at $40.64.

The set comes with two Prismatic boosters, a metallic Eevee coin, and a foil Eevee promo stamped with the Pokémon Day 2025 logo. It pairs nicely with the new 2026 collection if you’re looking to bulk out a themed pickup.

Stock has also resurfaced on a few other notable bits, including the [Phantasmal Flames Three-Pack Blister at $32](https://zdcs.link/Q451rd?object_uuid=7445e5bc-c2e9-45b1-a816-e4d312e34bac&t=article), the Mega Lucario ex Figure Collection, and several Scarlet & Violet Unova-era items like the Poster Box, assorted tins, and the Illustration Collection.
