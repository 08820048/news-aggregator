## Samsung Galaxy S26 Phones: Release Date on March 11

Samsung's Galaxy S26 comes with all of the improvements we would expect from an iterative release. The S26 is the base model and is equipped with an Exynos 2600 APU that's more powerful than the Snapdragon 8 Elite found on the previous generation's S25. Additional features include 60W of wired fast-charging, privacy function for the display, and new AI features. The S26+ has a larger 6.7" 3120x1440 QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X display and bigger battery capacity.

The S26 Ultra is the flagship model and features the even more powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 NPU, the largest screen size (6.9") and biggest battery across all three models, sharper 50MP telephoto and ultra-wide lenses, included S-Pen stylus, a more scratch resistant Gorilla Glass Armor display, and enhanced Google Gemini AI integration. If you can afford it, the S26 Ultra is easily worth the upgrades and should allow you to skip more than a few generations.
