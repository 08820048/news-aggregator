2026 is looking to be a big year for mummy fans

## The Mummy Returns is coming back to theaters for its 25th anniversary, but there's a catch

The Mummy is dusting off all of that sand in its unmentionables and returning to the cinema. But we're not talking about the new horror flick by _Evil Dead Rise_ director [Lee Cronin](https://www.polygon.com/lee-cronin-the-mummy-movie-trailer/) (or the ill-fated [Tom Cruise reboot](https://www.polygon.com/2017/6/7/15753440/the-mummy-review/)). No, we're talking about Stephen Sommers' 2001 fantasy action-adventure film, _[The Mummy Returns](https://www.polygon.com/new-mummy-movie-brendan-fraser-rachel-weisz/),_ the sequel to the much-beloved 1999 film, _The Mummy_.

If your theater of choice just so happens to be [AMC](https://www.amctheatres.com/movies/the-mummy-returns-25th-anniversary-82818), then you're in luck: The thrilling sequel is scheduled to appear on AMC screens on March 27 this year.

Set seven years after the defeat of Arnold Vosloo's ancient antagonist Imhotep, Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz reprise their roles as Rick O'Connell and Evelyn. Now married with a son, Alex (Freddie Boath), the two are once more put to the test when Alex accidentally awakens Imhotep. The high priest, understandably a little steamed after his deadly schemes were thwarted in the last movie, begins yet another campaign of fear and terror against humanity.

The Mummy franchise has continued to delight and enchant viewers since 1999, and now, with _The Mummy Returns'_ 25th anniversary coming up, fans will have the chance to watch Rick, Evelyn, Alex, and several returning characters such as John Hannah as Evelyn's brother Jonathan, Oded Fehr as Medjai warrior Ardeth, and Patricia Velasquez as Anck-su-namun on the big screen. Fun fact: Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson also appears as The Scorpion King, his first ever acting role (just don't bother watching his spinoff movie).

This celebration of _The Mummy Returns'_ 25th anniversary comes at the most opportune time: there's a [_Mummy 4_](https://www.polygon.com/new-mummy-movie-brendan-fraser-rachel-weisz/) in the works, something which fans (alongside [Brendan Fraser](https://www.polygon.com/the-mummy-4-brendan-fraser/)) have been waiting years for. It will supposedly (and wisely) ignore the third installment, _Tomb of the Dragon Emperor_, to instead cook up something new.
