Feed these critters their favorite foods to increase your bond with them

In [_Heartopia_](https://www.polygon.com/heartopia/), there are **wild animals** found around the island who you can befriend, as long as you feed them. Each animal has its own **trough** to be filled with its **favorite food**, but finding the troughs at first can be somewhat annoying, as they're pretty spaced out. If you want to win over the hearts of the animals (and get some free loot for doing so), you'll want to make sure to feed them every day.

Below we explain what animals do in _Heartopia_, where to find the **animal troughs**, and what the **animal's favorite foods** are.

## What do animals do in Heartopia?

There are **eight animals** scattered around the map in _Heartopia_ with each congregating around their respective trough (more on that below). If you feed the animals every day, you'll increase your bond with them, which you can check via the "Animal" menu. As you level up your bond, the animals will leave you gifts more frequently, you'll unlock more interactions with them, and they may even visit your home. (Though yes, the alpaca will spit in your home. Gross.)

Upgrading your bond with each animal will also unlock special decorations, like little figurines and puzzles. You can also earn Wishing Stars from ranking up your relationship with the animals, so there's no harm in filling up those troughs every day.

## Where to find animal troughs in Heartopia

    ![A map in Heartopia showing where to find the eight animal troughs around the island](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/jlee_260213_1001_heartopia_animal_locations.jpg?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2)Graphic: Julia Lee/Polygon | Source images: XD via Polygon

The troughs are spread out, but you can make a lap around the island on your vehicle to hit them all fairly quickly. The animals are in the following locations:

-   **Panda**: Southern Forest
-   **Capybara**: Western Onsen Mountain
-   **Bunny**: Western Suburbs
-   **Fox**: Central Flower Field
-   **Sea Otter**: Central Fishing Village
-   **Ferret**: North-western housing area
-   **Sika Deer**: Central Forest
-   **Alpaca**: Southern Flower Field (close to Fishing Village border)

Once you find the animal trough for the first time, you can track its location via the "Animal" menu screen.

## Each animal's favorite food in Heartopia

All the animals can be fed a bunch of different foods, but there will be three they prefer the most. Each animal can also eat the "universal animal food" bought from the pet shop. Here's a list of foods that we can confirm that animals love, as well as foods we know they can be fed. We'll update this as we discover more foods that the animals love.
