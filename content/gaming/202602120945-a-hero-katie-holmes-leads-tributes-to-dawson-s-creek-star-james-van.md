[Dawson's Creek](https://www.ign.com/tv/dawsons-creek) actress Katie Holmes has paid tribute to her former co-star James Van Der Beek, [who passed away yesterday aged just 48](https://www.ign.com/articles/james-van-der-beek-of-dawsons-creek-fame-has-died) after living with bowel cancer.

Holmes, who played the best friend and sometimes girlfriend of Van Der Beek's lead character Dawson Leery, posted a hand-written note on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/DUplHUFgemh/?hl=en) where she described her on-screen partner as "a hero."

"Bravery, compassion, selflessness, strength," Holmes wrote. "An appreciation for life and the action taken to live life with the integrity that life is art — creating a beautiful marriage, six loving children — the journey of a hero."

Fellow Dawson's Creek actress Busy Philipps also posted to [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/DUoddB8jsSC/), where she described Van Der Beek as "one in a billion." Philipps added: "He will be forever missed and I don't know what else to say. I am just so so sad."

Van Der Beek was initially diagnosed with cancer in late 2023, and went public with his condition a year later. Also writing on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/DUobrPskvfG/), The Fresh Prince of Bel Air star Alfonso Ribeiro shared that he had been one of many friends to visit Van Der Beek in recent days to say goodbye, following a "roller coaster" of a battle.

"I was with him through this horrible journey to beat cancer," Riberiro said, describing Van Der Beek as a "true friend, brother and life guide." He added: "His family and friends went on this roller coaster ride. The highs when it looked like he had it beat to the breaking lows of it coming back."

"Rarely am I at a loss for words," shared Dawson's Creek actress Mary-Margaret Humes, who played Van Der Beek's on-screen mother. "Today would be the exception. James, my gracious warrior, you fought a hard battle against all odds with such quiet strength and dignity."

Chad Michael Murray, who appeared in the show in a recurring role, wrote that Van Der Beek had been "a giant" whose "words, art and humanity inspired all of us."

The Dawson's Creek cast remained close following the show's 2003 finale, and reunited for a cancer fundraiser last September — though Van Der Beek was only able to appear via video message due to illness. The event was ultimately hosted by Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, who also has now paid tribute — saying his "whole heart" was with the actor's family.

Van Der Beek is survived by his wife Kimberly Van Der Beek and their children Olivia, Joshua, Annabel, Emilia, Gwendolyn and Jeremiah.
