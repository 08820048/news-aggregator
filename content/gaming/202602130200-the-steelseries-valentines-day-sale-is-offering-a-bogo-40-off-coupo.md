SteelSeries has continued to deliver some of the best gaming accessories for quite some time. I've been using [the incredible Arctis Nova Pro Wireless headset](https://www.ign.com/articles/steelseries-arctis-nova-pro-wireless) for years, with only a routine ear cushion replacement or two needed to keep them in tip-top shape. If you're on the hunt for a new headset, gaming mouse, or keyboard, SteelSeries is the place to shop this week with its Valentines Day sale.

Through Saturday, get 40% off a second product at the SteelSeries store when you purchase two, with the BOGO 40% promotion going on now. This deal [excludes](https://steelseries.com/policies/terms) Arctis Nova Elite, bundles, and blemished boxes, but is open to anything else available on the site. Here are our top picks for the SteelSeries Valentines Day sale.

## Buy One, Get One 40% Off During the SteelSeries Valentine's Sale

SteelSeries is best known for its [headsets](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-headset), and this is the time to bundle and save if you're buying for you and a friend or partner. The Arctis Nova Pro Wireless can be purchased with this deal, featuring ANC support, swappable batteries, and more. Grab two and save 40% off one pair, or you can throw in another SteelSeries headset and save 40% off.

If you're in need of upgrading accessories other than a headset, it would be worthwhile to grab both a keyboard and mouse, too. You can score the Apex Pro Gen 3 and the Aerox 5 Wireless together and save 40% off the latter. In our [Apex Pro review](https://www.ign.com/articles/steelseries-apex-pro-tkl-gen-3-gaming-keyboard-review), Michael Higham wrote that "Rarely do I pull a piece of tech out of the box and become immediately enamored with it. As soon as I got my fingertips on the OmniPoint 3.0 Hall Effect switches, I knew I was in for a great typing and gaming experience in both my favorite competitive shooters and intense MMORPGs. Being able to customize their actuation and reset point is a novelty that could make a difference in gaming while offering the flexibility needed to adjust for a work-type setting. The OLED control panel is a nice cherry on top."

Other SteelSeries accessories like the GameBuds for PS5 are also included with the Valentine's Sale, or you can pick up a premium mousepad, wireless speakers, microphones, and more. This sale only has a few more days left, so don't miss your chance to save on almost any SteelSeries product!
