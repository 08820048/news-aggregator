## PlayStation is courting younger players again, and that's the big-brain move it needs

Last week, PlayStation aired a super-sized [State of Play](https://www.polygon.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026/) stream that showed exactly what to expect from the PlayStation 5 in 2026 and beyond. It was an illuminating hour filled with genuine surprises, from a sequel to indie hit _Kena: Bridge of Spirits_ to a full remake of the original God of War trilogy. But the biggest takeaway from the show wasn’t any one game. Rather, it’s that a big-picture strategy is coming into focus: PlayStation is all in on courting younger audiences.

That becomes clear when you start connecting some disparate dots. It first seemed like a push towards family-friendly games could be emerging in 2024 with the release of _Astro Bot_ and _Lego Horizon Adventures_, though PlayStation didn’t follow that up with much in 2025. Now there’s much more evidence to suggest that those games were the start of a trend. [_Kena: Scars of Kosmora_](https://www.polygon.com/kena-scars-of-kosmora-bridge-of-spirits-sequel/) opened last week’s State of Play, a whimsical action-adventure sequel that calls back to the days of classic Sony series like Jak and Daxter. Notably, Sony is handling publishing duties for indie developer Ember Labs this time around. It’s a big investment in an IP that skews younger than many of Sony’s current heavy hitters.

Even those big players are getting an age adjustment, though. The recently revealed _[Horizon Hunters Gathering](https://www.polygon.com/horizon-hunters-gathering-co-op-game-announced/)_ finds Guerrilla Games once again trying to make a Horizon game geared towards younger players. The upcoming co-op multiplayer game looks like Monster Hunter by way of _Fortnite_ with its cheery visuals and colorful action, and certainly seems geared toward a similar audience as _Lego Horizon Adventures_.

Meanwhile, the infamously adult-oriented God of War series just turned into a boyhood coming-of-age story thanks to [_God of War Sons of Sparta_](https://www.polygon.com/god-of-war-greek-trilogy-remake-son-of-sparta/). The surprise-released Metroidvania still has a bit of blood, but the brutality has been dialed down to a T-rated level for the first time ever and it's filled with young heroes (much to the chagrin of former series director David Jaffe). Currently, there’s a sense that Sony is trying to find new ways to expand the appeal of mature, story-driven series to younger players who will grow into the mainline games soon enough.

To understand why that’s significant, you have to go back to the earliest days of the PlayStation brand. When you heard the word PlayStation in the ‘90s, it immediately conjured images of cartoon mascots like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon. Sony was publishing plenty of mature games like _Syphon Filter_ — a third-person shooter powered by political intrigue — but it was very much building on the groundwork laid by Nintendo and Sega. Kids and teens were a major focus and they were being served in several ways.

PlayStation’s efforts have changed significantly over the years. As the company’s first-party publishing efforts have tightened up with fewer games per year, Sony has often focused its attention on its adult audience. We’ve seen fewer cartoon mascots and more mature, cinematic games like _The Last of Us_ and _Ghost of Yōtei_. Sony was still making games for younger players before 2024 (_Sackboy: A Big Adventure_ and _Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart_ were two of the PS5’s earliest games), but you could count them on one hand. We’re beginning to see that number tick up as Sony’s upcoming game slate is looking much more diverse than it has in years.

It’s a wise strategy for a platform-holder like Sony. If your goal is to turn players into lifelong PlayStation owners, you need to get kids interested in video games at a young age. Players need to build up a literacy with the medium early so they can graduate to mechanically involved and narratively complex games like _God of War Ragnarök_ later. (I recently [praised Square Enix’s](https://www.polygon.com/dragon-quest-7-reimagained-art-style/) _[Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined](https://www.polygon.com/dragon-quest-7-reimagained-art-style/)_ for pulling that trick off with finesse.) I’m not sure if I’d be as invested in the medium today if I hadn't been welcomed in by the likes of Crash Bandicoot growing up. Many publishers, outside of Nintendo, seemed to have forgotten that in recent years, ceding ground to juggernauts like _Roblox_ and _Fortnite_.

Sony’s upcoming slate of games is a push in the right direction, and it could stand to go even further. Turning Horizon and God of War into kid- and teen-friendly games makes sense on a business level, but the PS5 could still use some original games and characters that belong to younger generations. (Astro Bot and Kena both feel like pushes towards that goal.) I want today’s kids to have their own Spyros and PaRappas. Those are the kinds of games that can inspire curiosity in players of all ages, and give them reasons to graduate to the bloody stuff later.
