[One Piece](https://www.ign.com/tv/one-piece) fans, it’s your time. The latest trailer for season 2 of Netflix's [live-action adaptation TV show](https://www.ign.com/tv/one-piece-live-action) is here, and it’s full of fan-favorite moments.

Luffy and the Straw Hat Pirates are still on their search for the One Piece treasure [in this new sneak peek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-XxKVxZ2fU), which sees the characters leave East Blue and start their first adventure in the Grand Line — which is fitting for the season's full title, One Piece: Into the Grand Line.

During this portion of their journey toward the treasure, they [stop in Loguetown](https://www.ign.com/articles/one-piece-season-2-exclusive-new-images-of-loguetown) and also meet the Baroque Works, a criminal syndicate who appear to have sinister intentions for Luffy and his gang.

The new trailer also gives fans a glimpse of some really cool recognizable elements in the series that will get the TV treatment this season, like Zoro’s fight with members of the Baroque Works from the Whiskey Peak story arc, the Straw Hat Pirates getting eaten by a whale named Laboon, and Luffy’s group finding dinosaurs among the Baroque Works members they stumble upon on the Little Garden island.

The visual also highlights some new characters and actors being added in season 2, namely David Dastmalchian as Mr. 3, Charithra Chandran as Miss Wednesday, and Lera Abova as Miss All Sunday. Mikaela Hoover will also voice Chopper, a talking reindeer who serves as a doctor in the Straw Hat Pirates.

The show is an adaptation of the 1997 manga series by Eiichiro Oda and stars Iñaki Godoy as Luffy. Season 2 of the series is set to premiere on March 10 — and Netflix has [already greenlit a third season](https://www.ign.com/articles/one-piece-season-2-trailer-includes-season-3-confirmation-from-netflix), so we’re excited to jump back into the quest.
