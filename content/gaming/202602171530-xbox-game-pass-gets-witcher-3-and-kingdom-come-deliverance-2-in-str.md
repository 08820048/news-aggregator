Too many RPGs to play, too little time

Xbox Game Pass subscribers have plenty of new options to play this month, especially if they're on the (wild) hunt for their next RPG. Games like _Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora_ and _Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza_ [were added to kick off February](https://www.polygon.com/xbox-game-pass-february-2026-avatar-yakuza/), and now _The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt — Complete Edition_ and _Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2_, among others, are set to join them.

2015's [_The Witcher 3_](https://www.polygon.com/the-witcher/) is often regarded as one of the greatest RPGs of all time, and for good reason. It presents a strong central narrative as the monster hunter Geralt travels in search of his adopted daughter Ciri, as well as plenty of side quests and monster hunting bounties to keep you distracted (as any great RPG should). If you haven't yet checked out _The Witcher 3_, there's no time like the present, as [_The Witcher 4_ is on the way](https://www.polygon.com/cd-projekt-witcher-4-5-6-release-dates/), and [rumors abound that more _The Witcher 3_ DLC](https://screenrant.com/witcher-3-expansion-2026-price-leak-rumor/) will arrive sometime soon to bridge the two games together. Speaking of DLC, both _The Witcher 3_'s expansions are included with the _Complete Edition_ on Game Pass, and they're as essential as any quest in the main game. _The Witcher 3_ will be available on Game Pass Feb. 19.

If you've already played (and re-played) _The Witcher 3_, Game Pass is also getting a more recent must-play RPG to check out. Last year's [GOTY contender](https://www.polygon.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-winners/) _Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2_ arrives on Game Pass March 3. It's a very realistic RPG (don't expect any monster slaying) that continues Henry's journey from the first game as he tries to survive in 15th-century Europe amid a civil war. It landed at 15 on [our list of Polygon's best games of 2025](https://www.polygon.com/best-games-2025/), with [one of our writers calling it](https://www.polygon.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-best-rpg-2025/) "the best RPG I’ve ever played." And if you don't want to dive into the sequel without having played the first game, no sweat — the first K_ingdom Come: Deliverance_ was also recently added to Game Pass.
