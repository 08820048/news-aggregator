summary: "Here's where to find Pokémon TCG Ascended Heroes ETBs in stock and at market price right now."
---
Pokémon TCG Mega Evolution's latest expansion, Ascended Heroes, is (as per usual) increasingly hard to get hold of right now. While [Ascended Heroes cards are now available](https://zdcs.link/aB8lXE?object_uuid=15c4a37b-37cf-4ae2-aafa-e3462b71917b&t=article), stock is painfully low or nonexistent at most major retailers.

If you're looking to bag yourself an ETB (or several) that sport a rather magnificent Mega Dragonite, now that it's officially 'available', then here's where you can currently pick one up, and what prices to expect at each retailer.

MSRP is $49.99, but the current market price at TCGplayer is listed at around $119. That's a fairly significant drop from what we were seeing near the beginning of the month ($140-$160), and back to the prices we were seeing across January.

Fans can only hope this doesn't reverse in the coming weeks, and perhaps even continues to drop further. But, in my view, the market price looks to be levelling out at around $115-$120, so if you're desperate and not looking to wait any longer, this is the best time to buy.

Compare this to Phantasmal Flames, as that was settling at around $150-$200 in November last year, but has thankfully since come down to around [$80-90 market price](https://zdcs.link/aX41Xm?object_uuid=15c4a37b-37cf-4ae2-aafa-e3462b71917b&t=article), which is _much_ better, a whole lot more what most fans would be happy/ expecting to pay for an ETB these days, even if it is above the original list price. We can only hope that Ascended Heroes follows a similar trend.

In terms of where to buy, TCGplayer is the most reliable option, but also the most expensive, so proceed only with the knowledge that you're paying a premium. Amazon is sticking to matching market price, so you can find an [Ascended Heroes ETB for $119.99](https://zdcs.link/aR73XX?object_uuid=15c4a37b-37cf-4ae2-aafa-e3462b71917b&t=article) there as well.

### Ascended Heroes - Elite Trainer Box - Pokemon Center Exclusive

Finishing up, if you're after the exclusive [Pokémon Center Elite Trainer Box for Ascended Heroes](https://zdcs.link/znBemG?object_uuid=15c4a37b-37cf-4ae2-aafa-e3462b71917b&t=article), you're instead looking at around $242.56 market price right now.

It's also significantly _down_ compared to its sky high $399 price point I'd seen most recently online, and, according the latest data, has dropped 29.83% at TCGplayer over the past month.

It's still pretty steep all things considered, but hardly unsurprising with how sought after these exclusive ETBs are, even years after release. Still, at this price, I wouldn't be surprised if more than a few fans snap it up, as it's one of the better resale deals I've seen on a Pokémon Center exclusive ETB.

That's the [price of cards](https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-ascended-heroes-most-expensive-cards) on the resale market these days! I'm sure most of us are already quite used to it, even if it's still a mega pricey. That being said, in my opinion, you may be better off waiting for prices to come back down a bit a few months down the line, so a bit of patience may pay off if you can manage it.

I'd say anywhere around the $100 mark is a good time to buy the standard ETB, but if you can wait a few months longer, hopefully we can see these falling to around $80-$90 as well, just like the Phantasmal Flames ETB has.
