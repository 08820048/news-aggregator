Neon Odyssey brings a space opera trilogy to 5e

## D&D goes full '80s space opera in Legends of Avantris' new Kickstarter

If, like me, you love blasting [fantasy-inspired Synthwave soundtracks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVdc1C1Zbko) during your [Dungeons & Dragons](https://www.polygon.com/dnd-dungeons-dragons/) sessions, then [Neon Odyssey](https://www.launchoracle.com/avantris-entertainment/neon-odyssey/BLAST?ref=ix5n1) is the 5e project you were waiting for. This '80s galore trilogy is coming from [Avantris Entertainment](https://avantris.com/), the group behind the actual play show [Legends of Avantris](https://www.youtube.com/legendsofavantris) and the massively successful crowdfunding campaign for [_The Crooked Moon_](https://www.polygon.com/dnd-dungeons-dragons/599070/dnd-beyond-crooked-moon-5e-preorder/), the folk-horror supplement for Dungeons & Dragons 5e that raised over $4 million.

Neon Odyssey is described in a news release as "Star Wars meets Cowboy Bebop with a coat of Synthwave paint," and to be honest, I wouldn't need much more than that. But this project is actually stacked with content — so much so that it requires three full books, totaling more than 1,400 pages. The _Outrunner's Handbook_ is focused on characters and rules, including space combat, reimagined classes, subclasses, species, backgrounds, spells, and more. The _Cosmic Codex_ will showcase the setting for the Stardust Rhapsody campaign, and it also includes monsters and magic items. Finally, the _Overdrive Expansion_ book will complement the other two, adding optional and advanced rules, and more setting details.

Marrying D&D and science fiction (or, in this case, space opera) is never an easy task. Rather than simply dropping the base D&D classes and rules into a space setting, Neon Odyssey aims for a full reskin. This includes reimagining all the core 5e classes with full sci-fi class skins, plus adding a new one, the Machinist, "described as an engineer and inventor of mechanical marvels with the power of technomancy." The project seems truly massive, promising more than 40 subclasses, 30 species, and 300 alien monsters and vehicles.

If the clown riding a space rabbit-unicorn is any indication, the Stardust Rhapsody setting leans into the whimsy of '80s science fiction rather than the dark, dystopian tones of cyberpunk, despite using words like "Outrunner." Still, the beautiful cinematic trailer has some glimpses of dark horrors hiding in the galaxy, along with many references for longtime fans of Legends of Avantris.

Avantris Entertainment will spotlight the upcoming launch of the Kickstarter, which will go live in May, with an updated programming slate with weekly Neon Odyssey-focused content spanning March through June 2026. Fans can also [acquire VIP status](https://www.launchoracle.com/avantris-entertainment/neon-odyssey/BLAST?ref=ix5n1) with a $1 deposit ahead of launch, which unlocks bonus perks tied to the campaign, including the digital Space Clown’s Guide to the Galaxy adventure, and an exclusive Neon Nights Dice Set.
