Infinity Castle returns to theaters next month, despite cries for a streaming release

## Demon Slayer fans set to be thrilled yet absolutely furious on March 6

I feel for fans of [_Demon Slayer_](https://www.polygon.com/demon-slayer-infinity-castle-review-movie-pacing/) who anxiously [await the day they can put _Kimetsu no Yaiba – Infinity Castle_ on loop](https://www.polygon.com/demon-slayer-infinity-castle-streaming-crunchyroll-netflix/)... because that day is not close to happening.

Please don't shoot the messenger, but Polygon is sad to report that the kickoff to _Demon Slayer_'s three-part theatrical finale is not coming to streaming any time soon. Instead of announcing a Crunchyroll debut, the studio revealed on Friday that the movie is heading back to theaters on March 6 for another big-screen run across the United States and Canada. So actually, it's good news. Maybe a little of both.

_Infinity Castle_'s one-day theatrical re-release will be available in both Japanese with subtitles and in English dub. Despite an unprecedented Japanese IMAX rollout earlier in February — an [anime](https://www.polygon.com/anime/)'s first time getting the premium large-format treatment — the March engagement is just your typical multiplex screens, unless you live near a premium [SCREENX auditorium](https://www.cinemark.com/screenxtheatres). In that format, the action in _Infinity Castle_ will expand the image across a 270-degree panoramic display. Can't get that at home.

For a movie that already dominated the global box office, the rerelease is a victory lap for Crunchyroll and parent company Sony. _Infinity Castle_ debuted last September to massive ticket sales, eventually climbing to become the highest-grossing anime film ever worldwide. In North America, it overtook [_Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon_’s decades-old record](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/demon-slayer-infinity-castle-52m-china-cume-730m-worldwide-1236428365/) to become the top-performing international film in the Western market's history. It currently sits with a global total of $797.3 million worldwide.

With such a limited run in 2025, it makes perfect sense for Crunchyroll to roadshow _Infinity Castle's_ big screen spectacle for as long as it can. But on Reddit and other forums, fans have been venting frustration at the extended wait. There are reams of threads titled "how to legally watch _Infinity Castle_." As [one user wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1op3jg9/how_do_i_legally_watch_demon_slayer_infinity/), “I bought Crunchyroll specifically to watch the movie, but it seems I’ll have to wait a long time till it’s added.”

Let me throw this out there: Imagine your home viewing experience, but in the company of others who love anime and on a much, much bigger screen. You can get that on March 6.
