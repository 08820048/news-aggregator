Tonight has brought our best look yet at [Silent Hill: Townfall](https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-townfall), the next installment in Konami's classic survival horror series that's set and developed in Scotland.

In an initial trailer shown during Sony's State of Play broadcast, and then Konami's own dedicated Silent Hill Transmission show, fans got to see the suitably foggy setting of St. Amelia and the game's protagonist Simon Ordell, all in Townfall's first-person perspective.

Made by Scottish development team Screen Burn (of Stories Untold and Observation fame) and published by Annapurna Interactive, the game looks set to offer a unique take on the Silent Hill formula, while still retaining some core elements.

So, yes, you can defend yourself from horrible-headed enemies with planks of wood, pipes and a pistol. But you can also use stealth to sneak and hide — equipped with a portable "CRTV" device.

The analog-looking CRTV handheld is a tool to deliver narrative (and you'll need to tune it during gameplay) but also a clever way to show the outlines of enemies while you're ducked behind cover. The outlines of said enemies show up in its static, which is a clever touch.

Townfall's story is designed to be something of a mystery, with Ordell repeatedly waking up in St. Amelia. One moment in the Silent Hill Transmission highlighted the fact he was wearing a hospital tag on his wrist. Could it all be a dream, or hallucination from within a coma?

Tonight's look at the game concluded without any further word on when we'll get to play Townfall ourselves. (Several references to 8-19 in the trailer had me thinking it was set for an August 19 date, but alas this was not confirmed.) It is, however, now available to wishlist on PlayStation, and on PC via Steam and the Epic Game Store.
