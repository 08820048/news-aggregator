_Resident Evil Requiem_ is the ninth chapter of the Resident Evil series and sees the return of Leon S. Kennedy along with a new, but a little familiar, protagonist in Grace Ashcroft. In _Requiem_, you'll join the duo as they explore the horrific Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center and make their fated return to Raccoon City. However, it wouldn't be a Resident Evil title if you didn't have to deal with spooky creatures and zombies along the way.

## Brains over brawn

Before you dive into the Wrenwood Hotel and learn more of Grace's backstory, you should refresh your memory of the Resident Evil series with some [lore](https://www.polygon.com/resident-evil-lore-explainer/). This will help you get an idea of what's going on in this world and what may be in store for your future. Next, keep our [beginner's guide](https://www.polygon.com/resident-evil-requiem-re9-beginners-tips-tricks/) and [interactive map](https://www.polygon.com/map/resident-evil-requiem-re9-interactive-maps/) handy as they can (and will) save your life in these tight corridors. If you get stuck, make sure to check out our [walkthrough](https://www.polygon.com/resident-evil-requiem-re9-guide-walkthrough-escape-from-wrenwood-hotel-emergency-exit-key/) that'll guide you through the many labyrinths of _Requiem_.

## So anyway, I started blasting

Knowledge is power, but sometimes, you do just need to shoot some zombie heads to survive. As you're playing, you'll notice that Grace and Leon handle zombies a little differently. Grace is a little less prepared, so you'll need to make sure to increase her [inventory space](https://www.polygon.com/resident-evil-requiem-re9-increase-inventory-space-hip-pouch-locations/), so she can hold more healing items, ammo, and [crafted items](https://www.polygon.com/resident-evil-requiem-re9-blood-specimen-locations-crafting-unlocks/). Meanwhile, Leon will, well, start blasting and roundhouse kick the zombie scum in the head. You aren't asking yourself how you should kill the zombies, but rather, which [weapon](https://www.polygon.com/resident-evil-requiem-re9-best-guns-where-to-find-location-shotgun-sniper-rpg/) do you fancy today?
