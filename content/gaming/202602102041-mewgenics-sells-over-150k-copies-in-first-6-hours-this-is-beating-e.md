Mewgenics, the cat-breeding tactics roguelike from the developer of The Binding of Isaac, has hit the ground running to say the least. It’s already made back the cost of its roughly seven-year development, blew past internal sales expectations, and is currently approaching the highest peak concurrent player count of Isaac itself – and it only launched today at 6am PT.

“So far this is beating expectations by quite a lot,” developer Tyler Glaiel tells IGN, saying it likely took less than three hours for development costs to be fully recouped. “Its a bigger launch than any of the Isaac expansions already, and its only been a few hours.”

His partner Edmund McMillen, best known for games like Isaac and Super Meat Boy, put just how wide of a gap that is into a perspective: “I think the highest sales day for any game of mine, release-wise, was \[The Binding of Isaac:\] Rebirth, and it sold 40,000 units I think day one.” By comparison, McMillen says Mewgenics sold around 152,000 copies in its first five-and-a-half hours. “Isn't that kind of insane?”

Mewgenics is also sitting at more than [63,000 concurrent players](https://steamdb.info/app/686060/charts/) on Steam at time of writing, creeping steadily towards Rebirth’s all-time peak of 70,701. “We knew the game was good and would do good,” Glaiel says, “but Isaac is \*HUGE\* so we thought it was unlikely to beat that.” There are also almost 85k people watching it on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/mewgenics) – one of which is McMillen himself, who says he’s enjoying watching [Northernlion](https://www.twitch.tv/northernlion) be so immediately good at it.

The critical reception for Mewgenics has been glowing as well, currently sitting at an 89 on sites like [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/game/mewgenics/) and 96% positive user reviews on Steam (with roughly 1,700 in at the moment). IGN’s own [Mewgenics review](https://www.ign.com/articles/mewgenics-review) gave it a 9/10, saying it’s “a fantastic tactical RPG that's good for more than a hundred hours of roguelike runs. Just when you think you have it figured out it'll throw something completely unexpected and hilariously gross at you – and probably a catchy new original song, too.”
