Kratos’ coming-of-age journey in **_God of War Sons of Sparta_** finds him and his brother Deimos searching for a missing Spartan outside the walls of the city. As Kratos, you’ll come across plenty of enemies out for your blood, as well as dozens of collectibles to pick up during your travels.

Though _God of War Sons of Sparta_’s map isn’t as maze-like as in other Metroidvanias (a main objective marker can guide your way), it’s still filled to the brim with locations and items to discover. You’ll save and enhance Kratos’ skills and weapons at **campsites**. Test your mettle against waves of enemies at **sacred olive trees**, and return the fruits of labor to **temples** to upgrade your stats. Upgrade materials are scattered around the wilds outside of Sparta, and you’ll need plenty of **rusty scraps**, **i****ron bars**, and more to ensure your Dory (spear) and Aspis (shield) are the best they can be.

Check out our **interactive map for** **_God of War Sons of Sparta_** below.
