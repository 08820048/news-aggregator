We’ve somehow already made our way to March, which hopefully brings some spring weather, but at the very least, guarantees new releases across all your favorite streaming services. While Disney+ has a relatively light month for new additions, some major highlights coming to the service include the premiere of a new season of Daredevil: Born Again, a Hannah Montana 20th anniversary special, and a spread of new shorts.

Without further ado, here’s what’s getting added to Disney+ in March.

The major MCU release of the month, [Daredevil: Born Again](https://www.ign.com/tv/daredevil-born-again) is returning for its second season on March 24. We were big fans of the first season, highlighting “masterful performances” from Charlie Cox and Vincent D’Onofrio in [our review](https://www.ign.com/articles/daredevil-born-again-season-1-review). The new season is expected to run for another 8 episodes, while teasers have already confirmed [the return of Jessica Jones](https://www.ign.com/articles/daredevil-born-again-season-2-trailer-shows-jessica-jones-in-action-and-matthew-lillards-mysterious-character).

On the classic Disney side, the original Hannah Montana series is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, and Miley Cyrus has signed on for a filmed special that will stream exclusively on Disney+. Details are slim, but we do know the special will include never-before-seen archival footage as well as an interview with Cyrus herself.

### **March 27**

-   **Versa: Short Film - Premiere**
-   **Chibi Tiny Tales: Shorts S6 - New Episodes**

Versa is a new short film from Disney Animation Studios’ directed by Malcon Pierce, best known for his work on Moana. The short is described as a “cosmic dance of life,” and is marketed as a more “mature” turn for the animation studio.

The streamer will also get another batch of episodes from its Chibi Tiny Tales spin-off series.

-   **In Your Radiant Season (Hulu Original) - New Episodes**
-   **Super Animals S3 - New Episodes**
-   **Chibi Tiny Tales: Shorts S6 - New Episodes**

Yes, another episode of American Idol. From this point on, however, new episodes will stream live on Disney+ the same night they’re broadcast on ABC.

### **March 31**

-   **If It's Tuesday... It's Murder (Hulu Original) - Premiere**

Disney+ will premiere the new Spanish original series If it’s Tuesday.., which follows a group of Spanish tourists on what turns into a particularly eventful trip to Lisbon.

While it hasn’t necessarily been confirmed in any episode release schedules, this is also most likely when we’ll get a second episode of Daredevil.

## Expect More Additions From Hulu

2026 is the year that Disney has claimed will see the merging of [Hulu content into the Disney+ app](https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-no-reason-to-get-a-hulu-subscription-without-disney-plus-anymore), where it's consistently lived internationally. Presumably as part of this transition, several Hulu Originals will be coming to U.S. Disney+ over the course of the month without firm release dates:

-   **Would You Marry Me? S1**
-   **To Cook a Bear S1**
-   **The Manipulated S1**
-   **Daughter of Fire S1**
-   **Couch S1**
-   **Call My Agent Berlin S1**
-   **The Breslau Murders S1**
