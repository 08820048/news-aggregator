Sci-fi action game [_Romeo Is a Dead Man_](https://www.polygon.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man/) is divided into many **chapters**. If you're curious what lies ahead, we'll lift the veil on the number of chapters as well as their names. Based on how long it took to complete each chapter, as well as the amount of time spent on mini-games and optional challenges, we'll also estimate the game's duration.

Here's how long it takes to beat _Romeo Is a Dead Man_.

## How long to beat Romeo Is a Dead Man

The first chapters shouldn't take much more than an hour each, but from Chapter 5 onward, it'll be closer to 2-3 hours per chapter. On top of the linear, chapter-based story, you will likely spend several hours on boss trials, Palace Athena challenges, and mini-games like katsu curry cooking and DeadGear Cannonball. Taking all that into account, the average playthrough should be around **20 hours**.

Of course, if you defeat every boss on your first attempt and skip most of the optional content, it won't take nearly as long to beat _Romeo Is a Dead Man_. If you're a fast player, you may finish the game in **12-16 hours**. And if you're the opposite, trying to collect every Bastard and every Badge, it's easily **30+ hours**.
