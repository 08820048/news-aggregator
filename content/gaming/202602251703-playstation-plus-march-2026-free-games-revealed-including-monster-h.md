Originally a 2021 Switch exclusive, _Monster Hunter Rise_ came to PlayStation consoles in 2023. Like in other Monster Hunter games, you'll, well, set out to hunt some monsters, using a variety of weapons and tools at your disposal to capture or kill them. It also includes a tower defense mode, Rampage, as well as local and online multiplayer, where four hunters can band together to stalk their prey. _Monster Hunter Rise_ has been warmly received by critics, with the PlayStation 5 version holding an 87 Metascore on [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/game/monster-hunter-rise/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5).

_PGA Tour 2K25_ is the latest entry in 2K's golf sim series, having launched last February. Like in other 2K sports sims, you'll create your own player and rise in the ranks of the career mode, upgrading your attributes and filling out your skill trees along the way. PGA majors The PGA Championship, U.S. Open, and The Open Championship arrive in the PGA Tour 2K series for the first time with _2K25._ Your player will have to be at the top of their game to win them.
