Today brings our best look yet at upcoming Star Wars movie [The Mandalorian and Grogu](https://www.ign.com/movies/star-wars-the-mandalorian-and-grogu), via a two-minute trailer that also features the return of a classic Clone Wars character.

After a [short and disappointing appearance last week at the Super Bowl](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-mandalorian-and-grogu-super-bowl-trailer-gives-me-a-bad-feeling-about-this), today's proper trailer gives us much, much more of Mando himself and his adorable young ward. We also get to see several scenes where Pedro Pascal's face is exposed — something of a novelty in the original Mandalorian series.

However, it's the face of another familiar character that Star Wars fans are now celebrating — the bounty hunter Embo, an ally of the Hutt Clan who appeared in numerous episodes of the Clone Wars TV series. Embo looks to be playing a villainous role again here, which is no surprise considering the movie's story sees Din Djarin forced to deal with a jacked-up Rotta the Hutt.

Also in the trailer? An infant rodian we're naming Baby Greedo, Sigourney Weaver's New Republic colonel, and Grogu using his Force powers to blow up a poor mouse droid. Once again, we see that Djarin has traded in his sleek N-1 starfighter as seen in the most recent season of The Mandalorian, and has reverted to using a ST-70 assault ship, better known as a Razor Crest.

We also get a good sense of where this movie sits in the franchise's timeline. A group of what appears to be Imperial Remnant leaders or supporters is glimpsed, with one declaring: "Long live the Empire!" Snowtroopers also return, as seen back on Hoth in Empire Strikes Back.

Djarin appears to be fully working with the New Republic now, crossing bad guys off of Sigourney Weaver's hitlist for the greater good, in order to stop a return to galactic war. Djarin's plans appear to hit a setback, however, when he's seemingly captured by Embo and the Hutts, though luckily Star Wars Rebels' Zeb appears to be around to help.

Of course, you can already [pre-order a LEGO version of the movie's new Razor Crest ship](https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-lego-star-wars-the-razor-crest-set). Later this year, there will even be [a Mandalorian and Grogu cookbook](https://www.ign.com/articles/hungry-star-wars-fans-beware-theres-a-mandalorian-grogu-tie-in-cookbook). Star Wars: The Mandalorian and Grogu will be released in theaters on May 22.
