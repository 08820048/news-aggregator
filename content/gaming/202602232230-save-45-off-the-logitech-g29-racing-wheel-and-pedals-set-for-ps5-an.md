### Logitech G29 Racing Wheel and Pedals Set

If you're a big fan of racing games like Gran Turismo or Forza Horizon 5 and you've been using a DualSense controller or gamepad this entire time, then this price drop might be the excuse for you to step up your immersion to the next level. The G29 was already one of the [best racing wheels](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-racing-wheels) under $300, and definitely _the_ best racing wheel under $200.

Standout features include a gorgeous hand-stitched leather steering wheel with 900 degrees of rotation, sturdy metal base, durable steel ball bearings in the shaft, gear-driven dual-force motor feedback, stainless shifter and pressure-sensitive pedals. The force feedback does an excellent job of simulating providing force and resistance.

If you're a PC user and wondering which model to get, PlayStation's G29 model is actually a bit nicer than Xbox's G920 variant. The G29 has LED shift lights located on the top of the wheel's spokes. These LEDs light up progressively as the car's RPMs rise in-game. The G29 also has a rotary knob on the wheel that can be customized to different functions, like traction control, brake bias, or split differential.

If you're in the market for a racing wheel and pedal combo, grab this G29 at the heavy discount while you can.
