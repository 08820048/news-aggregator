The Sonic the Hedgehog film franchise has finally landed on its Amy Rose, and it's a heck of a choice. Kristen Bell has been confirmed to voice the pink hedgehog pal (and possible love interest) for Sonic the Hedgehog 4, as [reported by THR](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/sonic-4-kristen-bell-voice-amy-rose-1236508342/).

We've known that Amy Rose was coming to Sonic's world since the end of Sonic the Hedgehog 3, when a [mid-credits scene](https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-post-credits-scene-ending-explained) revealed both Metal Sonic and Sonic's ally, Amy Rose, arriving to save him with a massive hammer in tow.

But it's been over a year since that reveal, and it's only just now that we're learning who's destined to lend their voice to arguably the last remaining super-famous Sonic companion to join the team. Ben Schwartz has been voicing the blue blur since the first movie, with Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik, and Colleen O'Shaughnessey reprising her video game role as Tails. Idris Elba joined the group in Sonic the Hedgehog 2 as Knuckles, and Keanu Reeves stepped in as Shadow the Hedgehog in the third movie. It remains unclear who will be voicing Metal Sonic (if anyone – Metal Sonic notoriously doesn't really speak in most appearances). And we also don't know if other fan-favorite Sonic characters (Blaze? Silver? Cream and Cheese? Big the Cat?) will show up.

As for Bell, you've almost certainly seen or heard her in something before. She's perhaps best known as the voice of Anna in the Frozen films, but has also starred in TV series such as The Good Place, Gossip Girl, Veronica Mars, and Nobody Wants This, as well as films including Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Couples Retreat. She's appeared in a few video games too, including as the voice and likeness of Lucy in Assassin's Creed 1, 2, and Brotherhood, and, of course, as Anna in the Disney Infinity games and Kingdom Hearts 3.

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 is [currently expected to zip into theaters on March 19, 2027](https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-release-date-announced). There's a [spin-off movie coming as well in 2028](https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-spin-off-movie-confirmed-and-fans-have-a-clear-idea-which-character-it-will-star), and fans are speculating that it will star Shadow the Hedgehog.
