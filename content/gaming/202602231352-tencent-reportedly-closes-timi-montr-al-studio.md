TiMi Studio Group, a Tencent subsidiary, has reportedly shut down its Montréal studio.

Sources told [Game File](https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-timi-montreal-closed) that the closure was anticipated, and rumours resurfaced last Friday when another source stated the "shutdown was imminent."

In a now-unavailable [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fernandezluzuriaga_today-timi-montreal-is-officially-closing-share-7430638121156784128-RAMk/), a TiMi Montréal programmer said the studio had closed and noted that employees had been aware "for some time."

Another former worker [responded to the post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7430638121714659328?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7430638121714659328%2C7430644929057415169%29&dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287430644929057415169%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7430638121714659328%29), writing: "This team was exceptional not just in talent, but also in camaraderie. It's one of those experiences that sticks with you for a very long time, and I feel privileged to have been a part of it."

Representatives for Tencent and TiMi Studio Group did not provide a comment to Game File.

Founded in 2021, TiMi Montréal was [led by former Assassin's Creed creative director Ashraf Ismail](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/fired-ubisoft-director-ashraf-ismail-now-working-for-tencent). The studio had not released a game in the five years since its founding.

Ismail joined the studio as a "consulting creative director" after being fired by Ubisoft Montréal in 2020 [following a misconduct investigation](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisofts-ashraf-ismail-fired-following-misconduct-investigation).

In 2023, [Tencent shuttered Team Kajiu](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-closes-shop-on-team-kaiju) – TiMi's Los Angeles-based studio. It was [established in 2020](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-owned-team-kaiju-is-searching-for-the-untapped-fantasies-of-first-person-shooters) and was working on an AAA multiplayer title.

Team Kaiju was overseen by former Halo and Battlefield leads Rosi Zagorcheva and Scott Warner.
