[_Mewgenics_](https://www.polygon.com/mewgenics-review-pc/), the strange turn-based tactics game all about cat breeding, has become a rampant success since its release in early February, impressing players with its layered mechanics, seemingly endless synergies, and an [absolutely incredible soundtrack](https://www.polygon.com/mewgenics-soundtrack-music-spotify-where-to-listen-ridiculon/). When _Mewgenics_ developer Edmund McMillen called streamer Dan Gheesling — who is perhaps best known for his time on _Big Brother_ — to share that the game was on the brink of selling a million copies, he also delved a bit into what's next for the title, including a possible _Mewgenics_ musical.

_Mewgenics_ has become more of a runaway success than co-creator McMillen ever imagined. The game's development has been in the public eye for over a decade, shifting hands from a project with Team Meat to an independent endeavor from the _Binding of Isaac_ developer and Tyler Glaiel, who previously worked with McMillen on _The End is Nigh_. When the long-anticipated game was finally released, it [became the most-played roguelite on Steam](https://www.polygon.com/mewgenics-surpasses-hades-2-steam-most-played-roguelite/) within a week.

A TikTok posted by Gheesling captured the moment McMillen was about to sell a million copies, which prompted the streamer to ask if the developer ever considered stadium-sized events of people playing his game. However, the co-creator had a different vision for the game's success. "This is what I care about," McMillen said. "I hope the game does well enough that Matthias and Jon, the guys who made the music, could go on tour, or even do like a musical."

Matthias Bossi and Jon Evans make up the two-man band Ridiculon, who, alongside crafting the [soundtrack of _Mewgenics_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A02AApHGqNc)_,_ have worked with McMillen on several previous titles, like _The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth_. McMillen said in the call that Ridiculon is not only on board for a _Mewgenics_ musical, but "dead serious" about making it happen. Musicals based on video games are few and far between, but if anyone can come up with a way to translate cat breeding and combat into an entertaining stage show, it's the eccentric team behind _Mewgenics_.
