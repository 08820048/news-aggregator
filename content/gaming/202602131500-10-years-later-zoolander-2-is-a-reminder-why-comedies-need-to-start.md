A decade later, Zoolander 2 stands as proof of why 2010s comedy sequels flopped

On [David Duchovny’s _Fail Better_ podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0aCiIIuTjPl29bBQYjtAGX) in 2024, Ben Stiller admitted he went into [_Zoolander 2_](https://www.polygon.com/2015/11/18/9754148/zoolander-2-trailer-ben-stiller-benedict-cumberbatch/) thinking “everybody wanted this.” So when the movie flopped, it rattled him to his [ridiculously good-looking](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/0Kqjqrc3PPU) core. The high-energy performer behind 2000s comedy classics like _Dodgeball, Meet the Parents, Tropic Thunder_, and the original _Zoolander_ suddenly wondered if he’d lost his sense of what was funny. It’s a doubt that’s clearly stuck with Stiller as he’s transitioned into a new era of his career as the director behind critically acclaimed dramatic series like _Escape at Dannemora_ and [_Severance_](https://www.polygon.com/review/544883/severance-season-2-review-finale-3-setup/).

But the widely known lesson of Zoolander 2’s failure should have already clear long before its release in February 2016: Sequels are tough. Especially in the 2010s, when Hollywood kept dusting off classics like _Anchorman_, _Dumb and Dumber_, and _The Hangover_ for lackluster follow-ups. As Netflix began to kill off theatrical comedy as a reliable box-office hit, Hollywood pivoted to nostalgia and bloated casts as a quick fix. The only problem? No one stopped to ask what made the original movies work in the first place. A decade after its release, _Zoolander 2_ is an example of why 2010s comedy sequels tanked so hard, and why the genre is still struggling today.

Directed by and starring Stiller, _Zoolander 2_ brought the actor’s dimwitted supermodel Derek Zoolander back to the runway 15 years after the original [became a cult comedy hit](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a37762711/zoolander-20th-anniversary-ben-stiller-interview/). Directed by and starring Stiller alongside Owen Wilson as rival model Hansel, the sequel follows the duo as they’re pulled into an Interpol conspiracy tied to the assassinations of the world’s most beautiful people. The film leans heavily on celebrity cameos and fashion-world satire in an attempt to recapture the original’s absurd magic.

_Zoolander 2_ kicks off with [Justin Bieber](https://www.polygon.com/justin-bieber-twitch-stream-shambles-clip-livestream-new-music/) getting gunned down, instantly tying the film to a very specific era of the mid-2010s. Right out of the gate, Stiller signals he’s not leaning on the same intentionally dumb comedy that made the original a hit. Instead, he tries to update the formula, clearly aiming to realign itself with what Hollywood thought was funny at the time: callbacks and cameos.

Even though the first _Zoolander_ had big-name cameos like Billy Zane and [David Bowie](https://www.polygon.com/2016/1/11/10749686/david-bowie-omikron-nomad-soul-david-cage/), they felt woven into the story, getting moments that mattered rather than just popping up for applause. In _Zoolander 2_, it’s more about the callback than the contribution. Zane’s back, the foam latte assistant returns, even the Evil DJ shows up, but it all feels thinner this time, more like cheap fan service than anything substantial.

What made the original _Zoolander_ work is that Derek and Hansel played complete idiots in a mostly normal world. They felt like the extreme end of fashion’s nonsense. In the sequel, the whole world is just as ridiculous as they are, so the joke flattens out. Add in [all the celebrity faces](https://www.bustle.com/articles/140954-39-zoolander-2-celebrity-cameos-ranked), and it stops feeling like a parody of reality and starts feeling like a parody of itself.

You could say the same thing about 2013’s _Anchorman 2,_ which crams Kanye West, Liam Neeson, Harrison Ford, and Will Smith into its bloated, 2-hour runtime. A year later, _Dumb and Dumber To_ forgot that Lloyd and Harry worked because they were clueless, not cruel, and leaned more into them being jerks than being dumb. A lot of comedies from that era either turned into something like the famously terrible [_Movie 43_](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/29/movie-43-hollywood-humiliation), throwing more celebrity faces at the screen than actual jokes.

_Zoolander 2_ ended up being part of the slow collapse of theatrical comedies. It’s a movie that chose to play it safe and lean on brand recognition instead of taking a real swing. Like many of its peers, it defaulted to the same overloaded cameo formula that had already begun to wear thin earlier in the decade. In the process, it lost sight of what made the original so sharp and specific. Rather than building the best sequel, Hollywood chased familiarity and assumed nostalgia alone would be enough.

Today, comedy is less universal than it was back then, and a theatrical comedy is harder to pull off than ever before. Audiences were so starved for laughs that some people found the [new _Naked Gun_](https://www.polygon.com/liam-neesons-2019-thriller-cold-pursuit-showed-why-hed-be-great-for-the-new-naked-gun/) reboot “[life-affirming](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/articles/test-audiences-found-naked-gun-220000201.html),” while [producers believed](https://www.thegate.ca/film/070210/producer-erica-huggins-on-bringing-back-the-naked-gun/) they would initially have to teach audiences how to watch parodies again. Nobody really has the cure for what’s hurting comedies right now, but if history’s any guide, the fix probably starts with getting back to basics — which is what _Zoolander 2_ should have done.
