Oscar-nominated racing blockbuster [F1](https://www.ign.com/movies/f1) is getting a sequel, producer Jerry Bruckheimer has now confirmed.

Speaking to [BBC News](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8jx7kvm4leo) today, Bruckheimer confirmed he was "working on a sequel," though did not share further detail on a filming schedule or plans for a release. It's unknown, too, whether F1 star Brad Pitt will return for the second film.

The quick confirmation comes as something of a surprise, [just days after executives from both F1 and Apple TV hinted at the possibility of a F1 follow-up](https://www.ign.com/articles/after-f1-movie-success-racing-boss-hopes-to-share-more-on-a-potential-sequel-next-year) while simultaneously suggesting that any public confirmation was still a year away.

"Stay tuned," said Formula 1 boss Stefano Domenicali at an Apple TV press event last week. "We're going to tell you something more in the future. Never say never. But we need to digest more the success of this movie because it was something unique. And if you want to think of a new one, it has to be really, very, very good. Therefore, if this will happen, it will not be for next year. But maybe next year we're going to be here, and hopefully we have something more to announce."

Bruckheimer, who apparently didn't get that memo, today said he planned to be involved again — including in casting decisions. "I never worked with Brad Pitt before and it's really a thrill to work with Brad," he added, without confirming whether the Fight Club, Ocean's 11 and Troy star had yet been tempted back on board for the sequel.

Work on F1 2, or whatever it gets called, seems to still be in its early stages — and that's not surprising, considering the fact that the first F1 is still to see out its award season. Released last summer, the movie earned $630 million at the global box office and [garnered four Academy Award nominations](https://www.ign.com/articles/sinners-and-one-battle-after-another-lead-the-2026-oscar-nominations-see-the-full-list) for Best Picture, Best Film Editing, Best Sound and Best Visual Effects.

"F1: The Movie follows the sports movie playbook almost perfectly," IGN wrote in its [F1 movie review](https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-review-brad-pitt-joseph-kosinsky), "finding ways to be just that much better at nearly every stage of its 156-minute runtime – creating a super fun racecar flick in the process that eventually finds its way to victory lane."
