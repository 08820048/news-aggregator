## What Is Crimson Desert?

Crimson Desert is a medieval fantasy-themed game set in the land of Pywel, where you play as Kliff, captain of the Greymanes, as the ruthless Black Bear army executes a brutal attack that leaves the Greymane forces scattered. Your job is to explore the world to reunite with your comrades and rebuild what’s been lost. As you do so, you’ll forge new alliances and discover even more dangerous threats looming over the land.

The journey takes you through all sorts of environments, from plains to deserts to mountains. You can ride mounts ranging from horses to wolves and dragons. You even have a Zelda-style glider that lets you leap from mountain peaks and soar over the land.

Although there’s some debate on social media about [whether Crimson Desert is an RPG](https://www.ign.com/articles/people-are-arguing-over-whether-crimson-desert-is-an-rpg-and-its-not-even-out-yet), developer Pearl Abyss doesn’t label it as such. It calls Crimson Desert “an open-world action-adventure game.” That’s because it doesn’t have character leveling or experience points. You do expand your capabilities, but you do so by finding items in the open world, like in an action-adventure game like Zelda or a Metroid.

Based on the trailers, it does look like a hodgepodge of popular game elements. It has an [extensive combat system](https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-reveals-more-about-combat-and-progression-confirms-dual-wielding-and-a-bear-you-can-actually-ride-on), an explorable open world, puzzles, giant monsters to fight, and more. Here’s hoping the game is not [too good to be true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QfiCqxa73A).
