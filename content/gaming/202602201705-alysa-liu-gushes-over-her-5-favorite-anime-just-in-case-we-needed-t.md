Remember when being an anime fan felt like a secret handshake between you and the other people who recognized it? Those days are long gone. [Anime is mainstream now](https://www.polygon.com/demon-slayer-infinity-castle-chainsaw-man-reze-arc-anime-blockbuster/), and just about everyone has a favorite series. Even Olympic champion Alysa Liu, the first American woman in more than 20 years to [win Olympic gold](https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/olympics/alysa-liu-gold-medal-rcna259816) in singles figure skating, has five go-to anime she loves. And if her picks tell us anything, it’s that the 20-year-old history-maker has great taste.

In a recent rapid-fire interview from Overtimewbb [on TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@overtimewbb/video/7608000640542903582?_r=1&_t=ZT-942GZVTXfNl), an interviewer asked the Olympic figure skater her top five favorite anime, and she did not disappoint. Before giving a disclaimer that these are in no particular order, Liu listed the following series: [_Jujutsu Kaisen_](https://www.polygon.com/jujutsu-kaisen-season-3-perfect-preperation-highest-rated-episode-controversy/)_,_ [_Chainsaw Man_](https://www.polygon.com/chainsaw-man-the-movie-reze-arc-review/)_,_ [_Attack on Titan_](https://www.polygon.com/opinion/601039/attack-on-titan-finale-backlash-crunchyroll-award/), _Madoka Magica_, and _Soul Eater_. Two things stood out as she ran through her favorites. First, she casually mentioned that a new chapter of _Chainsaw Man_ had dropped that day, confirming she’s not just an anime watcher but a fully caught-up manga reader. Second, when asked about _Attack on Titan_, she said she believed Eren Yeager was justified in triggering the Rumbling, the cataclysmic event that almost [ended the world](https://www.polygon.com/22392043/attack-on-titan-ending-analysis-manga-final-chapter-139/). Bold choice.

    ![Soul Eater holds a purple mass of energy in Soul Eater](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/d217366886c483f9d9c23cb5558dc22a6d53f75d16e88587e811682bd89f7e4a-_sx1080_fmpng_.png?q=70&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=1)Image: Studio Bones

Liu was seen walking around [with a Pochita plushy](https://www.polygon.com/alysa-liu-chainsaw-man-gold-medal-2026-olympics-figure-skater/), letting her love for _Chainsaw Man_ be known. But her love for _Attack on Titan_, _JJK,_ and _Soul Eater_ suggests a love for anime sad boys with a little bit of attitude. Eren and Denji from _Chainsaw Man_ are two sides of [the same emotionally stunted coin](https://www.polygon.com/chainsaw-man-vs-attack-on-titan-eren-denji-comparisons-differences/). Meanwhile, mentioning _Soul Eater_ and _Madoka Magica_ proves that Liu is more than an anime fan: she's a connoisseur. The two series started airing when she was respectively three and six years old, meaning she isn't afraid to look back at the history of the media to find some ground-breaking shows.

More than that, many of these anime mirror the world young people are coming of age in: stories shaped by distrust of authority, messy and [awkward romances](https://www.polygon.com/chainsaw-man-denji-horny-boy-ryan-colt-levy-interview/), and tight-knit friendships that help them find meaning and [beauty amid the harshness](https://www.polygon.com/attack-on-titan-mikasa-eren-love-dark-romance/). In other words, paraphrasing the famous Denji meme, Olympic gold medalist Alysa Liu is just like us, for real.
