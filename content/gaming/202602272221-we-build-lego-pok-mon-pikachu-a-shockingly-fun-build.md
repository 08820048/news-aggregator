summary: "Building Pokémon's mascot Pikachu out of LEGO was a great way to spend an afternoon, and is a satisfying addition to any Pikachu or Pokémon fan."

LEGO and Pokémon were my childhood (well, those and TMNT, but that’s for another time). I grew up building everything from simple cars and unrealistic houses to whatever amalgamation my creative mind could imagine. Never, as a kid, did I expect to see a fully licensed Pokémon set like the one we have now.

When I was a child, Pokémon was a game that, even now 30 years later, still has its claws in me with no sign of letting up. My younger siblings and I spent hours as kids, sitting with our Link Cables and GameBoys, trading Pokémon back and forth while we restarted one of our games enough times so we could each start with all three starter Pokémon. I knew I was hooked after spending an afternoon at my grandfather's house manually typing out my own Pokémon guide listing every Pokémon, their evolution levels, and what level they learned each move.

### Pikachu and Poké Ball - LEGO Pokemon

Set #72152

There is no Pokémon more iconic to the franchise than [Pikachu](https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-scarlet-violet/Pikachu), and while this set's first images weren’t as impressive as I’d hoped, I've changed my mind after building it and seeing it up close. As I gaze at it sitting on my shelf surrounded by other [Pokémon plushes](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-plushies), statues, and numerous other Pokémon collectibles, I have to admit that it looks great! Is it perfect? No, but man, it’s a very welcome addition to my collection.

With Pokémon celebrating its [30th anniversary](https://www.ign.com/videos/pokemon-presents-30th-anniversary-livestream-watch-party-post-show), it’s the perfect time to build this latest collaboration and go back to the series' roots, even though Pikachu wouldn’t be a selectable starter until Pokémon Yellow’s 1997/1998 release. LEGO provided IGN with a review set for a test build, and I was excited and fortunate enough to be the one to put it together. This 2,050-piece build took me around six hours to complete, which was long enough to revisit [Pokémon: The First Movie](https://www.ign.com/movies/pokemon-the-first-movie) (that big final moment still brings tears to my eyes), [Detective Pikachu](https://www.ign.com/movies/detective-pikachu-the-movie), and a couple of other Pokémon movies that were available to stream.

In the earlier steps, I was confused as to why our favorite little yellow mouse had so many vibrant pinks, teals, and other non-Pikachu-specific colors while building. However, as I finished the steps and his torso began to take shape, I realized all the additional colors would be hidden in the final build, and were there to make piecing together the inside easier.

It showed me how far LEGO has come in reducing complications and making larger builds faster to complete. I couldn’t help but smile after hitting major milestones in the build, and had the biggest one of them all when I settled Pikachu into his final resting position surrounded by the plastic lightning, making his action pose even more dynamic.

The biggest drawback to this LEGO Pikachu set is the $199.99 price tag; it's not much larger (size-wise) than its more affordable counterpart, [Eevee](https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-lego-pokemon-eevee-set-72151), and it doesn’t feel as epic as the much more expensive [Kanto starters set](https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-lego-pokemon-venusaur-charizard-and-blastoise-set-72153). Pikachu’s set comes with 16 bags. The first nine build the electric mouse #25 (National Pokédex) himself, while the remaining seven build his Poke Ball and the base to attach him to. The instruction manual is the same as the other Pokémon sets and comes with a Pokédex entry for Pikachu, as well as a look back on his history with the franchise, which was fun to remind myself of how far he and this franchise have come. Steps are well organized throughout the building process, and while the first few steps may look nothing like Pikachu, they quickly take shape as you move into the middle steps.

Similar to the Eevee build, as you progress, you will assemble sections, leaving small pockets open to eventually attach its articulable arms, legs, ears, and tail. Pikachu’s build starts with the internal portions of his torso, neck, and head, then adds the external rounded pieces to give him his iconic look. His lightning bolt-shaped tail and base were the highlights of the build for me, and they look great in LEGO form, accentuating Pikachu’s design. These steps were the simplest parts of the build, but they were also the most satisfying for me. Pikachu also features a few fun, swappable parts that can easily be adjusted for a new look. Swapping a hinge inside the pokeball converts it from open to closed. Pikachu can stand on his own or attach to his slanted stand (my preference), and you can swap the endcap pieces on Pikachu’s tail, swapping between heart-shaped (female) and pointed (male).

While not perfect, Pikachu’s feet are surprisingly pose-able to help with balancing him. Just take precautions during the build, because mine did take a tumble or two. His arms, however, are limited to vertical mobility and are prone to detaching if you try to adjust them too far outside that range. The good news is they are extremely easy to reattach should that occur, as it did to me a few times while rotating to attach new pieces.

His ears are also fantastic for articulation, as they can be rotated and angled freely, allowing you to quickly change his look. I only wish the set had a few more alternate pieces, like his mouth, to change his expression. There were only a few steps throughout the build process that gave me some trouble, and one of them was attaching the single round pieces to the center of another round piece. This made sense as one of the last words that comes to mind for me when I hear the word LEGO is round, which made these complications understandable.

The final portion of most steps is adorning Pikachu with pieces that help distinguish him from any other pile of yellow bricks. Thankfully, Pikachu’s eyes and mouth are printed on pieces, so no worries about ruining a set with a slightly misplaced sticker or anything of that nature. The eyes and mouth are both singular pieces to attach while his cheeks are a simple combination of pieces to give them their rounded appearance.

After completing Pikachu himself, the last things to build are his Poké Ball and lightning bolt-shaped stand, which made up the last seven bags of pieces. Though that's 40% of the bags, it's also filled with lots of larger flat pieces and was the quickest part of the build. This was great because I built it in two sittings, making getting to the finish line easier and all the more enjoyable.

## What generation of Pokemon Starters should get a Lego set next?

Gen 1 (Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle)

Gen 2 (Chikorita, Cyndaquil, Totodile)

Gen 3 (Treecko, Torchic, Mudkip)

Gen 4 (Turtwig, Chimchar, Piplup)

Gen 5 ( Snivy, Tepig, Oshawott)

Gen 6 (Chespin, Fennekin, Froakie)

Gen 7 (Rowlett, Litten, Popplio)

Gen 8 ( Grookey, Scorbunny, Sobble)

Gen 9 (Sprigatito, Fuecoco, Quaxly)

Gen 10 (Browt, Ponbon, Gecqua)

Pikachu may not be my favorite Pokémon (Bulbasaur, you know, I had to include him in here at least once), but it was still an incredibly fun build and a wonderful addition to my collection. Each step after the first few clearly showcases what you're building, from the memorable stripes on its back to its lightning-bolt-shaped tail. For those who love Pikachu, I think this is an easy recommendation if you have the cash to spare. The pictures and marketing don’t really do this one justice; it's one of those sets that look much better in person.
