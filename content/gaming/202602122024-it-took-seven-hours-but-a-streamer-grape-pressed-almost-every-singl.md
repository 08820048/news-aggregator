On his RTGame channel in 2021, YouTuber and streamer Daniel Condren [made headlines](https://kotaku.com/hitman-player-tries-to-kill-every-npc-in-one-map-with-a-1846143719) by dragging countless NPCs from a Hitman level into a walk-in freezer, in an attempt to simultaneously kill every single NPC in one map. He didn't quite succeed. Now, he's [made another go at it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sDOFSiIN4c), using the gigantic grape press in the winery that is Hitman 3's final map. And this time, it went better.

You can watch it take place in a 40-minute edit of the stream. Well, actually the edit seems to be of two streams – in the first, he drags the NPCs one-by-one to smash them after knocking each one out with a baseball bat. That takes over 15 hours, according to the timer at the top of the stream. Then, the video cuts to what looks to be another stream, started at 5 hours and 49 minutes in, after he had dragged each body to the area just in front of the press, ready to be crushed by Condren's cruel hitman.

The wine is almost ready.

For over an hour after that, he hauls each body beneath the press, framerate tanking every time the pile of bodies enters the camera's view. A few game crashes later, and at about 7 hours and 13 minutes (again, according to the timer at the top of the screen), he's done it. Elated and sounding a little like a cartoon despot, he hits the grape presser's start button and smashes... most, but not all, of the NPCs. A second run of the press takes care of the last few. He then finds another body elsewhere in the winery that he'd either missed or that had been glitchily hucked there.

So Condren didn't quite meet his mad goal of simultaneously making wine out of all of the level's NPCs like some deranged, murderous [Lucille Ball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUxjOS3g6Uc), but he got close enough for blues. He certainly seems pleased at the end when he adds, “And a shout-out to the population of Mendoza, Argentina. We love you guys. And you make a great beverage.”
