Key details setting up the plot of [Spider-Man: Brand New Day](https://www.ign.com/movies/spider-man-brand-new-day) have popped up online, and now fans know exactly how long it has been for Tom Holland's hero since the events of No Way Home.

A description of Brand New Day's setting is included in a product [page](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/834186/spider-man-brand-new-day---the-art-of-the-movie-by-jess-harrold/) for the movie's art book, which is now available to view via publisher Penguin Random House's website.

Essentially, this synopsis sets up where the movie begins — so there are no major spoilers here. Regardless, the confirmation that Brand New Day takes place a full _four_ years after No Way Home is new information — as is the tease for what happens next.

"Four years have gone by since we last caught up with our friendly neighborhood hero," the description reads. "Peter Parker is no more, but Spider-Man is at the top of his game keeping New York City safe. Things are going well for our anonymous hero until an unusual trail of crimes pulls him into a web of mystery larger than he's ever faced before.

"In order to take on what's ahead, Spider-Man not only needs to be at the top of his physical and mental game, but he must also be prepared to face the repercussions of his past! As Spider-Man: Brand New Day wows moviegoers the world over, discover the behind-the-scenes magic of the film's visual development — from early concept sketches to final character designs. Explore environments, costumes, and exclusive insights from the next chapter for Marvel's neighborhood hero!"

Alas, the book itself isn't available until August 4, after the movie's arrival. Still, though, there's some interesting things to consider here.

A four-year gap is a lengthy period of time for Peter to have grown apart from his former girlfriend and best friend, MJ and Ned. Both of them will also now be close to finishing, or indeed fully finished with studying at MIT.

"Are they actually going to start with a 4+ year jump from where we last saw him at the end of No Way Home?" wrote Marvel fan Vladmerius on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/comments/1r89qja/the_first_official_synopsis_for_brand_new_day_has/). "Are we potentially going to completely skip the college years? Full on adult Spider-Man would be pretty sick, as much as I enjoy the college years."

That time gap would also leave ample room for Spider-Man to have taken done the many, many villains expected to appear within the film — such as [Michael Mando's returning Scorpion](https://www.ign.com/articles/mark-ruffalos-hulk-set-to-return-to-the-mcu-for-spider-man-brand-new-day) and [Marvin Jones III's Tombstone](https://www.ign.com/articles/marvin-jones-iii-who-voices-tombstone-in-spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-will-play-the-supervillain-in-live-action-form-in-spider-man-brand-new-day) — alongside a rogues gallery that is [rumored to also include Tarantula and Boomerang](https://www.ign.com/articles/is-spider-man-brand-new-day-an-unofficial-sinister-six-movie-as-leaked-artwork-appears-to-show-yet-more-villains-fans-have-theories).

Mention of an "unusual trail of crimes" pitches the movie as street level — something fans have been keen to see after Tom Holland's previous multiversal and indeed outer space shenanigans in past appearances. As for Peter Parker being "no more," it's clear there's been no quick reversal of Doctor Strange's spell to make the world forget the man behind Spidey's mask.

In terms of where this places the movie within the broader MCU, it's now expected that the film's events will take place in 2028, just before those of the forthcoming Avengers: Doomsday. Finally, Peter himself will now be aged 21 or 22 — something fans have noted means he can finally have a beer.

"Pretty big plot implications," wrote Marvel fan CrumblingSaturn. "Just drunk Spider-Man, drinking and swinging around on his webs." Added mctaylo89: "I'm picturing an office worker watching a drunk Spider-Man sloppily bumping into the window as he thwips about."

Last month, [Cretton described Tom Holland's return in Spider-Man: Brand New Day as a "tonal shift" from the actors' first trilogy](https://www.ign.com/articles/this-is-a-new-chapter-spider-man-brand-new-day-features-a-tonal-shift-from-tom-hollands-first-trilogy), and a "new chapter" of Peter Parker's story. Fans are still waiting for the film's first full trailer, though [what appeared to be grainy footage of an upcoming Spider-Man: Brand New Day teaser hit the internet](https://www.ign.com/articles/apparent-spider-man-brand-new-day-trailer-leak-seemingly-drops-strong-hint-at-sadie-sinks-character) just before Christmas, featuring dialogue that positioned Sadie Sink's mysterious character as a villain — initially, at least. "You're a mess, Spider-Man," Sink's character can be heard to say. "Don't get in my way. Otherwise, it won't just be your friends who don't remember who Peter Parker is."

Spider-Man: Brand New Day arrives in theaters on July 31.
