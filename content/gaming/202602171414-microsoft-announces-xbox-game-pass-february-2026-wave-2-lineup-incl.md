Microsoft has announced the Xbox Game Pass February 2026 Wave 2 lineup, which includes big hitters such as The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (and in its Complete Edition, no less) plus Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.

As detailed in a post on [Xbox Wire](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/02/17/xbox-game-pass-february-2026-wave-2/), available today, February 17, are Aerial\_Knight’s DropShot (Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, Handheld, and PC) and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora (Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, Handheld, and PC) for PC and Ultimate subscribers. Premium members also gain access to Avowed (Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, and PC) — as detailed in the [first wave of February Xbox Game Pass titles](https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-announces-xbox-game-pass-february-2026-wave-1-lineup) announced several weeks ago.

Coming later this week on February 19 is Death Howl (Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, Handheld, and PC), as well as EA Sports College Football 26 (Cloud and Xbox Series X/S for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers). And then it's onto the big guns: The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Complete Edition (Cloud and Console) also becomes available on February 19 for Game Pass Ultimate and Premium subscribers.

TCG Card Shop Simulator launches into Game Preview (Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, Handheld, and PC) on February 24 for Game Pass Ultimate, Premium, PC Game Pass subscribers. A day later, Dice A Million launches on PC, for PC and Ultimate subscribers. Towerborne's full game release then turns up (Console, Handheld, and PC) a day after _that_, on February 26, for Game Pass Ultimate, Premium, PC Game Pass subscribers.

Final Fantasy 3 (Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, and PC) arrives on March 3 for Game Pass Ultimate, Premium and PC Game Pass members. Finally, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 (Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, and PC) becomes available on March 3 for Game Pass Ultimate, Premium and PC Game Pass members.

The arrival of The Witcher 3 comes at an interesting moment, as [rumors swirl of a third expansion for the title](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-3-expansion-reports-continue-now-with-discussion-of-a-possible-dune-style-location) that's expected to arrive later this year and potentially bridge the gap between it and CD Projekt's The Witcher 4 (which is due in 2027 at the earliest).
