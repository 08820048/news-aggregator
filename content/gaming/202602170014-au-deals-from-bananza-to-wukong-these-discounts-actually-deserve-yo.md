There's a difference between a series of discounts and a bunch of price correction mistakes. Most of today's deals feel like the latter. A handful of these games are finally priced where their risk to reward ratio makes complete sense. I say get amongst them before they're goneski.

## **This Day in Gaming 🎂**

In retro news and with some serious overkill, I’m using a lightsaber to light 20 candles for **Star Wars: Empire at War**. This bad boy is an all-timer RTS and one of the best Star Wars tie-ins one could get in a sea of ordinary to bad ones. I remember being held in a Force Choke-esque thrall by its dual-layer strategy system: a galactic map for turn-based empire management and real-time battles on both land and in space. It translated into planet conquering, fleet building, and grand-scale warfare unlike any far, far away game at the time.

But mostly, I was tickled by the iconic hero units it offered and cool Easter eggs hidden. For the former, who wouldn’t dig hewing through rebels as an unstoppable Vader, like his horror visage in **Rogue One**? And I loved making a battle drag on too long to ensure an escaping Millennium Falcon would spawn.

"Everything the light touches is our kingdom and we're going to punch the &$%# out of it."

-   [Donkey Kong Bananza](https://www.amazon.com.au/Donkey-Kong-Bananza/dp/B0FB2SCVMM?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-19%) - **A$89** DK still understands momentum better than most studios understand fun. Bananza feels spring loaded and deliberate. Late game spikes hurt, but that sting is the point.
-   [Spyro Reignited Trilogy](https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000019382) (-65%) - **A$24.40** Three old school collectathons rebuilt with almost suspicious care. The camera can wobble, the nostalgia is thick, but the value here is quietly ridiculous.
-   [Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time](https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000029034) (-67%) - **A$23** This is Crash without rose tinted glasses. Inventive, mean, and obsessed with precision. Completionists will suffer. Everyone else gets a sharp, modern platformer for cheap.
-   [Hyper Light Drifter - Special Ed.](https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000011161) (-75%) - **A$7.50** Clean combat, zero chatter, all mood. It drops you in and trusts you to cope. Sometimes that trust feels misplaced. At this price, it is earned.
-   [OlliOlli World](https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000028263) (-75%) - **A$7.40** Silky controls hiding a quiet cruelty. Landing a perfect line feels brilliant. Missing it feels personal. Cheap entry to a very healthy obsession.

Or gift a [**Nintendo eShop Card**](https://zdcs.link/V0MbJ?object_uuid=b18fa514-312f-4eb5-bc00-23807a7fed6f&t=article).

## Exciting Bargains for Xbox

[](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/07/doomthumb-1754597530072.png)

Never bring a knife to a...er...portable nuke cannon fight?

-   [DOOM: The Dark Ages](https://www.amazon.com.au/DOOM-The-Dark-Ages/dp/B0DTT6YSVQ?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-17%) - **A$99** A more terrestrial, heavier DOOM that swaps ballet for brute force. Combat still sings once you adapt. Not a deep cut, but solid if you need fresh demons.
-   [Cyberpunk 2077](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/p/cyberpunk-2077/BX3M8L83BBRW/0001) (-65%) - **A$31.40** Finally the RPG it promised to be. Smart builds, sharp side quests, the odd lingering bug. At this price, Night City feels like a confident yes.
-   [Dragon's Dogma 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/p/dragons-dogma-2/9PJQMBMJ3154/0010) (-60%) - **A$43.10** Gloriously inconvenient fantasy. Pawns talk too much, travel takes patience, but the combat chaos is rare. You buy this for stories you did not script.
-   [Need for Speed Unbound](https://www.amazon.com.au/Need-for-Speed-Unbound/dp/B0BHL7S7NX?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-65%) - **A$37.90** Loud, stylish, slightly try hard. The handling clicks after a few upgrades. Cheap enough to forgive the attitude.
-   [Ori and the Blind Forest Def. Ed.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/p/ori-and-the-blind-forest-definitive-edition/BW85KQB8Q31M/0001) (-75%) - **A$7.40** Still heartbreakingly pretty. Platforming demands focus, escape sequences demand calm. For under ten dollars, it is hard to argue with that craft.

**Xbox One**

-   [DOOM Eternal](https://www.amazon.com.au/DOOM-Eternal/dp/B07DNTVWKH?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-35%) - **A$35.90** A jumpy combat chess match disguised as a shooter. Weapon swapping is mandatory, not optional. If you meet it halfway, it still rules.
-   [Injustice 2](https://www.amazon.com.au/Injustice-2/dp/B01GTHNS3I?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-60%) - **A$21.70** Surprisingly strong story for a capes brawler. Gear systems get bloated, couch matches stay fun. Cheap entry to DC melodrama.
-   [Unravel Two](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/p/unravel-two/C4VKLMG1HLZW/0001) (-70%) - **A$8.90** A quiet co op platformer about not messing up together. Short, occasionally fiddly, but sweet without being syrupy.

Or just invest in an [**Xbox Card**](https://zdcs.link/glwRb?object_uuid=b18fa514-312f-4eb5-bc00-23807a7fed6f&t=article).

## **Pure Scores for PlayStation**

[](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/11/gt-1762899726116.png)

Seriously considered photoshopping this to 67, to please the Gen Alpha among you. Then I remembered comedy ought to make sense.

-   [Gran Turismo 7](https://www.amazon.com.au/Gran-Turismo-7/dp/B09SW6GCGL?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-39%) - **A$75.90** A museum you can race in. The grind divides opinion, the driving feel does not. If you care about cars, this still delivers. Also, a VR must-own.
-   [No Man's Sky](https://www.amazon.com.au/No-Mans-Sky/dp/B0B4KN54RQ?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-39%) - **A$42.60** The comeback story that will not stop updating. Infinite planets, occasional repetition, endless tinkering. A long term hobby at a sensible price.
-   [RoboCop: Rogue City](https://store.playstation.com/en-au/product/EP6665-PPSA05059_00-ROB0000000000000) (-60%) - **A$21.90** Stiff animations, immaculate vibes. It understands RoboCop better than most licensed games understand themselves. Cheap enough to embrace the clunk.
-   [Visions of Mana](https://www.amazon.com.au/Visions-of-Mana/dp/B0CQD1F8DY?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-48%) - **A$52** Bright, earnest, mechanically tidy. It plays it safe, but plays it well. Comfortable RPG calories at a fair cut.
-   [Rise of the Ronin](https://store.playstation.com/en-au/product/EP9000-PPSA04540_00-RONINFULLGAME001) (-50%) - **A$62.40** Open world samurai drama with sharp combat. Structure feels familiar, duels feel electric. You are here for the steel, not the checklist.

**PS4**

-   [The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim VR](https://www.amazon.com.au/The-Elder-Scrolls-V-Skyrim-VR/dp/B077Y6H66T?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-50%) - **A$49.60** Yes, Skyrim again. Swinging the sword yourself changes the maths. Rough edges remain. The immersion still lands.
-   [Assassin's Creed Mirage](https://www.amazon.com.au/Assassins-Creed-Mirage/dp/B0BDR9W7MB?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-64%) - **A$29** A leaner Assassin's Creed that remembers stealth exists. Shorter, sharper, less bloated. At this price, it feels focused and fair.
-   [Persona 5](https://www.amazon.com.au/Persona-5/dp/B01GKHJP98?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-70%) - **A$25.80** Stylish, slow, occasionally indulgent. The cast carries it, the calendar demands patience. For this money, that time sink feels justified.

Or purchase a [**PS Store Card.**](https://zdcs.link/kn6Ww?object_uuid=b18fa514-312f-4eb5-bc00-23807a7fed6f&t=article)

## Purchase Cheap for PC

[](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/19/chineseign1-1724110355988.jpg)

Using this opportunity to recommend the movie _Monkey Man_. Think: the _Slumdog Millionare_ teen grows up and becomes John Wick.

-   [Black Myth: Wukong Digital Del. Ed.](https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/black-myth-wukong-digital-deluxe-edition?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-30%) - **A$73.40** Boss fights as spectacle. Demanding combat, uneven performance, undeniable ambition. A moderate cut, but the craft is real.
-   [Silent Hill 2](https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/silent-hill-2?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-61%) - **A$39.90** Oppressive and deliberate. Combat feels awkward by design. The atmosphere does the heavy lifting and still wins.
-   [The Bionic Commando Pack](https://store.steampowered.com/sub/1898/) (-82%) - **A$4.30** Old school grapple chaos in bulk. Some design has aged, the core loop has not. Curiosity alone justifies four dollars.
-   [Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1375400/Ghosts_n_Goblins_Resurrection) (-90%) - **A$4.40** Still cruel. Still precise. Still laughing at you. For under five dollars, that humiliation feels oddly acceptable.
-   [Kingdom Come Deliverance: Royal Ed.](https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/kingdom-come-deliverance-royal-edition?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-81%) - **A$11.30** Hardcore medieval sim that values realism over comfort. Slow burn start, deep immersion payoff. At this price, patience is rewarded.

Or just get a [**Steam Wallet Card**](https://zdcs.link/vdlm8?object_uuid=b18fa514-312f-4eb5-bc00-23807a7fed6f&t=article)
