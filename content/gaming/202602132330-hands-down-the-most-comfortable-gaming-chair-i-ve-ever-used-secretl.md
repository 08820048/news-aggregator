The [Secretlab Presidents Day sale](https://www.ign.com/articles/secretlab-presidents-day-sale-gaming-chair-deals-february-2026) is now live, featuring deals on most of the company's popular chairs and desks. The only exception is the new [lineup of Pokémon gaming chairs](https://www.ign.com/articles/now-you-can-show-off-your-favorite-pokmon-on-a-secretlab-titan-evo-gaming-chair), which are still only available to preorder at full price.

Secretlab is known for high-quality chairs, which have consistently been featured at the top of [IGN's list of the best gaming chairs](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-gaming-chairs). Secretlab's latest flagship chair, the Titan Evo Nanogen, currently holds the title as the 'overall best,' and is now getting its first discount of 2026. This is one of the more premium gaming chairs you can buy right now, so any sort of discount is notable.

New Release

### Secretlab Titan Evo Nanogen Edition

The Titan Evo Nanogen doesn't come cheap, but what you get for the price is a premium experience. It's a bucket-style seat that is comfortable right out of the box. The 'Nanogen' part of the name refers to Secretlab's in-house-developed Nanogen hybrid leatherette and nanofoam composite seat cushion.

The usual price of this chair is $799, but the Presidents Day sale drops that down to $750. It may not seem like much, but this is likely the lowest price we'll see on this chair all year. It's also still cheaper than a comparable [Herman Miller gaming chair](https://www.ign.com/articles/herman-miller-x-logitech-g-vantum-review) while offering more features tailored to gamers.

Both the Pure White and Pure Black versions of the chair are on sale right now. These are the newest versions of the Nanogen and are currently still marked as preorders. Secretlab has an estimated shipping date of March 8 2026, with a note that it could arrive earlier than that.

Secretlab is also discounting a number of its themed Titan Evo chairs as part of this sale, including the popular Genshin Impact editions. The [original Titan Evo](https://www.ign.com/articles/secretlab-titan-evo-2022-review) may not be _as_ nice as the newer Nanogen, but it's still one of the best gaming chairs on the market right now.
