Here comes the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man you never knew you needed. Amazon Prime just dropped the first trailer for its upcoming series [Spider-Noir](https://www.ign.com/tv/spider-noir), which features Nicolas Cage as a 1930s private eye with spidey senses — and as you can expect, it looks like one hell of a good time.

The sneak peek trailer, below, features Cage as Ben Reilly, a new version of the Spider-Noir character he previously voiced in 2018’s Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. And yes, there are two versions of the trailer, reflecting the fact that the show itself will be made available in both black and white or "true-hue color" versions.

Here's the noir version first:

The trailer features Reilly opening up about how he came to have his powers to the character of Cat Hardy, played by Li Jun Li. We see Reilly struggle with the change before emerging as a Spider-Man with a makeshift mask dressed in the classic noir garb: a trench coat paired with a hat and sunglasses. He beats up bad guys and gets drunk and acts pretty kooky yet mysterious along the way.

All in all, it’s a subtle balance that only Cage could achieve, which makes the show’s tagline all the more fitting: “With no power comes no responsibility.”

Now, here's that color version:

Cage stars in the series [alongside](https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-noir-confirms-sandman-actor-and-narrows-release-window-to-spring-2026) Jun Li, Lamorne Morris, Jack Huston, and Brendan Gleeson. Lukas Haas is also set for a recurring role on the show, which was created and will be showrun by Oren Uziel, writer of The Cloverfield Paradox. Uziel’s directorial debut was a neo-noir crime film called Shimmer Lake, so it makes sense he’d be tapped to tackle another noir story if he’s such a fan of the genre.

Prime is set to release Spider-Noir on streaming on May 27.
