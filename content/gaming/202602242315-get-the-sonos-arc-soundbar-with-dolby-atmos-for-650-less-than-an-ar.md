The Sonos Presidents Day Sale is officially over and the vast majority of deals are kaput. However, arguably the **best** deal that came out of the sale is still available. The [certified refurbished Sonos Arc](https://zdcs.link/9YMqEr?object_uuid=c8bc515d-d8d2-468b-b22c-bb65425ab959&t=article) has been marked down to just $449 with free delivery. That's [60% cheaper than an Arc Ultra](https://zdcs.link/aR70NK?object_uuid=c8bc515d-d8d2-468b-b22c-bb65425ab959&t=article) and an excellent deal for anyone looking for a Dolby Atmos soundbar.

Sonos refurbished products go through rigorous testing; they come with all accessories, manuals, and documentation and are reshipped in "pristine" packaging. Most importantly, **Sonos includes the same 1-year warranty as buying new**.

## Sonos Arc Soundbar (Refurbished)

### Sonos Arc (Refurbished)

The release of the Arc Ultra doesn't make the Arc any less of a great speaker. The 45" soundbar houses eleven precisely engineered internal speakers, including three tweeters and eight midwoofers each paired with Class-D amplifiers. It's capable of room filling audio by itself, but you'd still benefit from a separate subwoofer to round out the low end. Unlike the Sonos Beam, which only has virtual height channels, the Arc has two physical height channels for **true** Dolby Atmos support. The Arc also has a built-in microphone for smart assistant compatiblity, including voice control.

## Why Sonos?

If you're looking for an easy solution to add great sound to your home, then you've probably already heard of Sonos. Sonos speakers are very easy to set up, don't take a large amount of space, and most importantly, offer distortion-free room-filling audio. They're definitely pricier than budget options, but the sound quality is comparable to speakers that cost hundreds more or take up much more space.
