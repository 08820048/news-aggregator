Nintendo has released a lengthy Q&A article discussing its [upcoming Switch re-releases of Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen](https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-get-nintendo-switch-launch-next-week-priced-at-20-each), and addressed its decision to launch them separately — rather than as part of the Nintendo Switch Online service, like numerous other Game Boy Advance titles.

In response to the question "Why are you handling these classic games differently?" Nintendo [writes](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/71365/#s1q4): "In celebration of 30 years of Pokémon, we thought it would be fun to return to the ultimate versions of the original Pokémon adventures in the Kanto region with these special releases."

And in response to the question "Will these games also be coming to the Game Boy Advance – Nintendo Classics collection?" Nintendo replies: "These games are being offered as standalone software and are not planned for release as part of the Game Boy Advance – Nintendo Classics collection."

Neither of these answers seem to address the question of why the games could not _also_ be part of the Switch Online's GBA collection (as a nice way for subscribers to access them at no extra cost) or why the games are priced at $20 each — a cost that has raised many fans' eyebrows.

Indeed, the whole Q&A reads as a rather defensive list of answers to questions Nintendo has anticipated fans will naturally raise in response to its decision-making here.

"If these titles are meant to celebrate 30 years of Pokémon, why aren't you releasing the original Pokémon Blue Version and Pokémon Red Version games that launched 30 years ago?" reads another pre-empted question. "We thought users will appreciate the ultimate versions of those original adventures, which add various features and upgrades to the contents of Pokémon Red Version and Pokémon Blue Version," comes the reply. That's fair enough, but then having opened the Red and Blue can of worms, Nintendo goes on to pre-empt another popular question.

"Will you add the original Pokémon Red Version and Pokémon Blue Version or other Pokémon games to the Nintendo Classics collections available with Nintendo Switch Online?" It's a question Nintendo fans have asked ever since the first Game Boy titles were announced for Nintendo Switch Online, years ago. In response, Nintendo lists a selection of Pokémon spin-off games which are already available via the service, and then concludes with: "We have nothing to announce regarding any other potential titles."

One notable response suggests that Nintendo sees its launch strategy for FireRed and LeafGreen as likely a one-off: "What about other classic games beyond Pokémon titles? Is this the return of standalone Virtual Console types of offerings?" The response: "We remain focused on offering classic games through Nintendo Switch Online and Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack."

But again, other than Nintendo thinking this solution would be "fun", there's little reasoning given here for why FireRed and LeafGreen will be a costly exception to its usual rule.

Of course, Nintendo is unlikely to turn around and say to fans that, really, money is the reason why it is doing this — whether that is the motivating factor here or not. And of course, despite any complaints online, these re-launches will undoubtedly sell very well.

Other fans have suggested that Nintendo is just technically unable to offer FireRed and LeafGreen via its usual Nintendo Switch Online GBA catalog, which typically allows players to load multiple save states and rewind gameplay. Such antics would likely create havoc for The Pokémon Company, by allowing for easier duplication of Pokémon. With just this list of Q&A answers to go on, though, this remains speculation.

Pokémon will celebrate its 30th anniversary next Friday, February 27, with its annual Pokémon Presents livestream. Tune in then for more.
