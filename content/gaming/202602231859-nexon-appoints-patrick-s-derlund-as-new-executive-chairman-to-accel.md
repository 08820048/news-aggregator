Nexon has appointed Patrick Söderlund as its new executive chairman to "accelerate global strategy, transform creative direction, and lead the next phase of growth."

Söderlund – who's currently CEO at Arc Raiders' Embark Studios and had a long career at EA and DICE before that – said via his LinkedIn update that role will see him leading "a company-wide strategic transformation spanning portfolio strategy, M&A, and organizational development."

Söderlund already had a place on Nexon's board following the company's investment in Embark in 2018 and will remain CEO at Embark.

"Nexon has all the assets to unleash dramatic growth - incredibly talented people, iconic franchises, large and committed player communities, and best-in-class live service capabilities," Söderlund said in a press statement. "This is an enormous opportunity, but one that will require deep focus and discipline. Junghun and I are aligned on what needs to happen and I'm ready to get to work."

President and CEO of Nexon, Junghun Lee, added: "Patrick and I are fully aligned on transforming Nexon. He's built studios, attracted the industry's best people to work with him, and shipped massive global hits. That's exactly what Nexon needs right now."

Arc Raiders publisher Nexon released its 2025 earnings last week, reporting [record-breaking revenue for the third consecutive year](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nexon-revenue-rises-65-to-31bn-in-2025-driven-by-ongoing-success-of-arc-raiders). The company attributes this growth to its Dungeon & Fighter and MapleStory franchises, as well as Arc Raiders, which has sold over 14 million copies to date.
