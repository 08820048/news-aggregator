Electronic Arts has announced the preliminary results of its third fiscal quarter, reporting a 38% jump in net bookings to over $3 billion following the successful launch of Battlefield 6.

However, the publisher also recorded a deep decline in net income at $88 million compared to $293 million during the same period last year.

## **The numbers**

_For the three months ending December 30, 2025_

-   **Revenue:** $1.9 billion (up 0.95% year-on-year)
-   **Net income:** $88 million (down 69.9% year-on-year)
-   **Net bookings:** $3.04 billion (up 38% year-on-year)

## **The highlights**

Battlefield 6 was EA's most successful title of the third quarter, [having debuted as the best-selling game of 2025 in the US](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/battlefield-6-debuts-as-best-selling-game-of-2025-in-us). It also "set new franchise engagement records" according to the firm.

EA Sports FC also experienced continued success, with net bookings increasing into the high single digits year-over-year during the quarter, which was further "driven by strength in Ultimate Team and FC Mobile."

Elsewhere, net bookings for Apex Legends was "up double-digits" year-over-year, as a result of new features and events.

As noted during [EA's Q2 results published last October](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-reports-decreases-in-sales-and-revenue-during-q2), it is no longer holding earnings calls following the release of its results, nor is it providing forward-looking guidance.

This is due to the [pending $55 billion acquisition deal](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-investors-in-advanced-talks-in-50bn-leveraged-buyout-of-ea) by an investor consortium, composed of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners.

According to EA, the transaction "is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2027 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals."

Last month, [US lawmakers asked the Federal Trade Commission to "thoroughly" review the deal](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/us-lawmakers-ask-ftc-thoroughly-review-55bn-ea-deal-warn-of-potential-negative-impact-on-workers), warning that it could have a negative impact on workers.

"Given the scale of this acquisition and EA's current dominance over the domestic video game labour market, we believe careful scrutiny of this deal is essential," the group wrote.

"We respectfully urge the Commission to conduct a thorough investigation into the labour market consequences of this proposed acquisition, including EA's existing wage-setting power, the likelihood of post-transaction layoffs, the degree of labour-market concentration in relevant geographic and occupational markets, and the role of cross-ownership in shaping labour outcomes."
