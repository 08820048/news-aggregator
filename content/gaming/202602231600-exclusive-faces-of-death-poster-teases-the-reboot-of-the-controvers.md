The original Faces of Death from John Alan Schwartz became a cult classic and quite controversial as it was presented as a faux documentary that rumors claimed featured real-life deaths on screen. While it turned out most of the footage was fake, there was pre-existing footage of real deaths in the film.

In this new take on Faces of Death from director Daniel Goldhaber, the story will continue to explore that 'is it real or not?' conversation, and explore what happens when "a woman working as a content moderator for a major video platform discovers what appears to be re-enactments of murders from the original film. In an online world where nothing can be trusted, she must determine whether the violence is fiction, or unfolding in real time.”

Faces of Death stars Barbie Ferreira (Euphoria), Dacre Montgomery (Stranger Things), Josie Totah (Saved by the Bell), Aaron Holliday (Cocaine Bear), Jermaine Fowler (The Blackening) and Charli XCX (The Moment), and is being written by Goldhaber and Isa Mazzei.
