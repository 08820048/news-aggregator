Ahead of his big debut in Avengers: Doomsday as Doctor Doom, Academy Award-winning actor Robert Downey Jr. has officially been named the godparent of the Disney Adventure, Disney Cruise Line's newest and largest ship that is set to make its maiden voyage next month.

The Disney Adventure will first sail out of its home port in Singapore on March 10, and part of Downey Jr.'s responsibilities will be to "christen the ship, vowing to bring it a little luck and a lot of love." The godparent tradition is a huge one that goes back hundreds of years.

"It’s impossible to describe the majesty of the Adventure, and to be its godparent is an honor. As the largest ship in the Disney fleet, a gargantuan blessing must be bestowed … I’ll do my darndest,” Downey said.

“Our new ship continues Disney Cruise Line’s tradition of bringing great stories to life at sea, and we are honored that Robert Downey Jr., who has guided audiences through unforgettable Marvel stories, is the official godparent for the Disney Adventure,” added Josh D’Amaro, Chairman, Disney Experiences and incoming Chief Executive Officer of The Walt Disney Company.

Downey Jr. being the ship's godparent is quite fitting, as there will be tons of Marvel-themed activities for guests to enjoy, including Tony Starks' Ironcycle Test Run. Alongside being inspired by the character Downey Jr. played in the MCU, it will be the first roller coaster on a Disney Cruise Line ship and the longest of its kind at sea.

There will also be an 'Avengers Assemble!' live stage production in the open-air Disney Imagination Garden area, and a Marvel WEB Workshop inside Disney's Oceanner Club for young recruits to "try out new Super Hero suit prototypes and conduct training simulations using top-secret Avengers technology."
