[Convergence](https://www.convergenceshowcase.com/), an indie game showcase hosted by indie game influencers and streamers, returns for its third outing today, showcasing 30 upcoming titles including an unspecified number of world premieres. A further 28 games will feature in the pre-show, according to show organiser Fourth Floor Creative.

The event will be hosted by established influencers Jessie Cox and Dodger, with additional live gameplay demonstrations of featured games by creators including ChilledChaos, Laimu, TayderTot, Yenkoes, Preach, BearBoo, Cheebiez, Shakey and The Hot Cross. The show will go live at 7.30PM UK time (11.30 Pacific Time).

Featured games include MOUSE P.I. For Hire from Fumi Games/PlaySide Studios, DenshAttack! from Undercoders/Fireshine Games and How Many Dudes? From Butterscotch Shenanigans. Publishers and developers confirmed include Secret Mode, Kwalee and Super Rare Games.

The show will be broadcast on Convergence's [own channels](https://www.youtube.com/@Convergence_GS) and co-streamed to host channels, and will also be featured on [IGN.com](http://ign.com/) (operated by GamesIndustry.biz parent company IGN Entertainment) and on Steam through publishing partner Secret Mode. The show reaches an audience of 1.5M gamers, Fourth Floor CEO Rich Keith said in a press release.

The broadcast date means Convergence is among the first of what has become a year-long list of digital showcases, after the format rose to prominence during the pandemic. The coming months feature the return of [Galaxies](https://www.galaxiesshow.com/), [Six One Indie](https://www.sixoneindie.com/showcase) and The PC Gaming Show.
