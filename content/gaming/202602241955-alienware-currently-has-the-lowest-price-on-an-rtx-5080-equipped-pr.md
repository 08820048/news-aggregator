2026 has already seen [surges in the cost of RAM](https://www.ign.com/articles/2026-is-going-to-suck-for-pc-gaming) and GPUs. Unfortunately, this also affects the price of [gaming PCs](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-pc). Obviously this isn't an ideal time to be buying a new PC, but fortunately, there are still good deals to be found. If you're looking for a future-proof system, an RTX 5080 PC is powerful enough to set you up for 4K gaming for years to come.

The [Alienware Aurora R16](https://zdcs.link/z64KLd?object_uuid=a3ee7790-957f-4037-ad2e-169b8c14fb52&t=article) RTX 5080 gaming PC has dropped to as low as $2,229.99 with free delivery after a $600 instant discount. This is currently one of the least expensive RTX 5080 prebuilts you'll be able to get right now. Most other RTX 5080 prebuilts are currently priced at $2,500 and up.

The $2,130 system is equipped with an Intel Core Ultra 7 265F CPU, GeForce RTX 5080 GPU, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 1TB SSD. The Intel Core Ultra 7 265F is a 20-core processor with a max turbo frequency of 5.3GHz. It's cooled by a 240mm all-in-one liquid cooling system. The 1,000W power supply gives you headroom for upgrades down the road.

## The GeForce RTX 5080 GPU will run any game in 4K

Performance-wise, the RTX 5080 is no slouch. It's one of the fastest cards on the market, bested only by the $2,000 RTX 5090 and the discontinued $1,600 RTX 4090. This is a phenomenal card for playing the latest, most demanding games in 4K resolution at high settings and ray tracing enabled. The recent [DLSS 4.5 update](https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidias-dlss-45-is-here-with-better-image-quality-now-and-6x-multi-frame-generation-coming-soon) has further optimized multi-frame gen and upscaling so you can push really high framerates even in 4K. More games are supporting this feature, including Doom: The Dark Ages, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Borderlands 4, Stellar Blade, and [Battlefield 6](https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer).
