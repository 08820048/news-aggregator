## Sonos Arc Soundbar (Refurbished)

### Sonos Arc (Refurbished)

The [certified refurbished Sonos Arc](https://zdcs.link/9YMqEr?object_uuid=70690ac0-0bd6-4699-b243-d811788c225d&t=article) has just dropped in price to $449 with free delivery. That's half the price compared to getting the Arc Ultra _on sale_ and an excellent deal for anyone looking for a Dolby Atmos capable soundbar. Sonos refurbished products go through rigorous testing; they come with all accessories, manuals, and documentation and are reshipped in "pristine" packaging. Most importantly, **Sonos includes the same 1-year warranty as buying new**.

## Up to 20% Off Select Sonos Speakers

## Sonos Era 100

The Era 100 is Sonos' most popular and most versatile speaker. Despite its compact size, the Era 100 houses two tweeters, a mid-woofer, and three class-D digital amplifiers to produce precise, distortion-free audio even at high volumes. It has a microphone for voice control. Because of its flexibility, it's often paired with a sound bar or a second Era speaker.

## Sonos Arc Ultra

The Arc Ultra is Sonos' best soundbar speaker, replacing last year's Arc model. It is a massive 46" soundbar that houses 14 total speakers, including five tweeters (plus two upward-firing speakers for Dolby Atmos supported height channels), six midwoofers, and a four-motor, dual-membrane Sound Motion woofer. The Arc Ultra uses AI enhancement technology to isolate and boost the clarity of dialogue and voices. It also has a built-in microphone so that it can be controlled using voice commands from the Sonos app or your favorite smart assistant.

## Sonos Beam (Gen 2)

[![Sonos Beam Gen 2](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/06/sonosbeam-1728193203893.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/zj71dM?object_uuid=70690ac0-0bd6-4699-b243-d811788c225d&t=article "Sonos Beam Gen 2")

### Sonos Beam Gen 2

The Sonos Beam is a great option for someone who requires a more compact sound bar or simply doesn't want to spend $900 on the Arc Ultra. The Beam (Gen 2) is a 26-inch long, 5.0-channel soundbar with one tweeter and four mid-woofers for natural, balanced sound and four passive radiators to help with the low end. Although the Beam doesn't have physical height channels, it has two **virtual** height channels for Dolby Atmos support. It has a microphone for voice control.

## Sonos Era 300

[![Sonos Era 300](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/21/sononsera300-1732233075222.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/aeKYx1?object_uuid=70690ac0-0bd6-4699-b243-d811788c225d&t=article "Sonos Era 300")

### Sonos Era 300

The Era 300 is a much bigger, better sounding version of the Era 100. It's nearly double the size and weight. The Era 300 is also shaped differently, but there's a reason for that. The hourglass figure is designed to optimally arrange the six speakers so that they fire sound in all directions, enhancing Dolby Atmos and spatial audio effects. The Era 300 consist of four tweeters and two woofers paired with Class-D digital amplifiers and custom waveguides to help project sound to all corners of your room. Like the Era 100, it also has a built-in microphone for voice control.

## Sonos Sub Mini

[![Sonos Sub Mini](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/06/sonossubminiblack-1728193504557.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/z7MNeD?object_uuid=70690ac0-0bd6-4699-b243-d811788c225d&t=article "Sonos Sub Mini")

### Sonos Sub Mini

The audio savvy knows that a single speaker isn't enough to reproduce an entire soundstage. If you could pick only one other speaker to supplement your existing one, then a subwoofer would make the most meaningful impact. If you are space constrained, consider the Sub Mini. Despite its compact size, the Sub Mini can still powerful room-filling bass by way of two inward-facing 6" drivers contained in a sealed (non-ported) enclosure. It features wireless connectivity so you can avoid the hassle of routing a cable back to the rest of your home theater components.

## Sonos Sub 4

[![Sonos Sub 4](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/21/sonossub4-1732232319199.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/QbMqKo?object_uuid=70690ac0-0bd6-4699-b243-d811788c225d&t=article "Sonos Sub 4")

### Sonos Sub 4

If you aren't space or budget constrained, the Sub 4 is a step up from the Sub Min. The Sub 4 boasts even more power and a better low-end soundstage thanks to two inward-facing 5"x8" woofers and a traditional ported design.

## 20% Off Premium Entertainment Set (Arc Ultra and Sub 4)

_**Less expensive when purchased together**_

[![Sonos Premium Entertainment Set with Arc Ultra and Sub 4](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/24/sonospremiumentertainmentset-1763965517082.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/a018Zw?object_uuid=70690ac0-0bd6-4699-b243-d811788c225d&t=article "Sonos Premium Entertainment Set with Arc Ultra and Sub 4")

### Sonos Premium Entertainment Set with Arc Ultra and Sub 4

This set includes:

-   Sonos Arc Ultra soundbar ($879, normally $1099)
-   Sub 4 subwoofer ($719, normally $899)

If you plan on getting both of these speakers, you'll save an extra $100 if you purchase them as part of [Sonos' Premium Entertainment Set](https://zdcs.link/a018Zw?object_uuid=70690ac0-0bd6-4699-b243-d811788c225d&t=article) for $1,599. If you were to purchase the two speakers separately during the sale, they would total to $1,659. Without the sale, they'd cost $1,998. These are two of Sonos' highest end products and will give you an instant high-end home theater experience.

## Why Sonos?

If you're looking for an easy solution to add great sound to your home, then you've probably already heard of Sonos. Sonos speakers are very easy to set up, don't take a large amount of space, and most importantly, offer distortion-free room-filling audio. They're definitely pricier than budget options, but the sound quality is comparable to speakers that cost hundreds more or take up much more space.
