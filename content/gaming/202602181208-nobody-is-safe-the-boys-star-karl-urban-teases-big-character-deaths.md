The Boys Season 5 is set to bring the hugely popular Prime Video series to an end and fans are wondering which characters will die and which will survive. According to Karl Urban, who plays Billy Butcher, character deaths will come thick and fast — and "nobody is safe."

Speaking to [Variety](https://x.com/Variety/status/2023958824340656231), Urban told fans they should look forward to The Boys “coming to a big crescendo” when the fifth and final season hits Prime Video on April 8 with a two-episode launch. He wouldn’t point to any specific moment as jaw-dropping, no doubt to avoid spoilers, but did say there are plenty of shocking moments to come.

“Every season, but particularly this season, from episode one, you’re like, oh wow,” he said. “Nobody is safe. Fatalities right from the get-go. Let’s go! Last season! It’s all on!”

(I did enjoy Urban saying "fatalities" here, given he plays Johnny Cage in the upcoming Mortal Kombat 2 movie!)

Shocking moments are The Boys’ trademark, so we can expect plenty of over-the-top, gore-filled scenes. But who might die? The main character fans are wondering about here is Homelander, who starts Season 5 ruling over the United States with an iron fist.

The Season 5 trailer, below, revolves around Butcher rallying the troops as The Boys mount a fightback against Homelander, played by Antony Starr. Everyone seems up for it, although it very much looks like not everyone will make it out of the end of Season 5 alive. Keep an eye out for Jensen Ackles' Soldier Boy, who is back on ice and watched over by Homelander. Speaking of Homelander, we see him beat someone, or something, to a bloody pulp. A glimpse at a big name character death, perhaps?

Here’s the official blurb on The Boys Season 5:

> In the fifth and final season, it’s Homelander’s world, completely subject to his erratic, egomaniacal whims. Hughie, Mother’s Milk, and Frenchie are imprisoned in a “Freedom Camp.” Annie struggles to mount a resistance against the overwhelming Supe force. Kimiko is nowhere to be found. But when Butcher reappears, ready and willing to use a virus that will wipe all Supes off the map, he sets in motion a chain of events that will forever change the world and everyone in it. It’s the climax, people. Big stuff’s gonna happen.

Season 5 not only follows on from the end of Season 4, but Season 2 of spinoff Gen V. Fans were left wondering how the incredibly powerful Marie from Gen V might fare in a showdown with overpowered The Boys supervillain Homelander. Showrunner and executive producer Eric Kripke has said in the past, however, that fans shouldn’t expect Marie to appear in The Boys Season 5 as a Captain Marvel-style deus ex machina who kicks Homelander’s ass. That’s because Marie still hasn’t mastered her powers, or as Kripke has put it in a number of Gen V Season 2 finale spoiler interviews, she’s not Neo at the end of The Matrix.

For a much deeper dive on all this, check out IGN’s [Gen V Season 2 Ending Explained: How It Sets Up the Final Season of The Boys](https://www.ign.com/articles/gen-v-season-2-ending-explained-how-it-sets-up-the-final-season-of-the-boys) article, but to summarize, Marie can control blood, which potentially makes her more powerful even than Homelander. Homelander, for the uninitiated, is a sort of evil Superman, a character so overpowered that few rivals dare question his word. But Marie Moreau, played by Jaz Sinclair, has the potential to kill him due to her ability to command and weaponize blood.

The big question, of course, is whether Homelander actually dies in The Boys Season 5. Kripke told [THR](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/gen-v-season-2-finale-the-boys-season-5-eric-kripke-interview-1236407027/) last year that Butcher is “front of that line” when it comes to characters wanting to take Homelander out. But then there’s the likes of Stan Edgar, the aforementioned Marie, Annie, and Huey who would no doubt all like a piece of the action.
