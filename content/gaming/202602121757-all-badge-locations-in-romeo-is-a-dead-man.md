In [_Romeo Is a Dead Man_](https://www.polygon.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man/), **Badges** are invaluable. Offering passive buffs, such as reduced stagger and increased attack power, you'd best clip them onto Romeo's jacket (at the front, thus avoiding grandpa's face). With 36 Badges in total, you'll have plenty of choice, but beware that some Badge locations are easy to miss.

Here's an overview of all Badges in _Romeo Is a Dead Man_ and where to find them.

Badges are **mid- to late-game items**, as the first purchasable ones are found in Shiroyabu's Shop from Chapter 3 onward, and the first Badge outside the shop (the Myopia Badge) is found at the end of Chapter 2.

Keep in mind that most Badges are found in **optional areas**; you don't _have_ to enter any space-rifts (including the ones found during missions or Palace Athena challenges), but if you've got your eye on any of the passive buffs listed below, be sure not to miss them. If you skip or miss one, don't worry because you can always fly your spaceship to a previous mission location to pick up a missing Badge.

**Name**

**Effect**

**Location**

Myopia

Increases normal melee attack power by 30% but decreases normal ranged attack power by 60%.

At the start of **Chapter 2**, you'll enter a large, rectangular room in Sub-Space (the one upstairs, with a fence in the middle). Take the first door on the left, then follow the path to the left to find a purple Tesseract containing this Badge.

Angel's Face

Increases Bloody Summer attack power by 20%, but also increases damage taken by 30%.

In **Chapter 2**, after traveling through Sub-Space using the TV in the small fighting arena, you'll enter a storage space. The Badge is in the purple Tesseract on top of the crates, roughly in the middle of the room.

Magnetic Greenfields

Expands the Emerald Flowsion absorption area and increases Emerald Flowsion absorption by 20%.

After you've traveled through all of the Sub-Space areas in **Chapter 2**, but before fighting the final boss, you can take the corridor opposite the corridor with the TV screen on the ground floor, and it'll lead to a Badge.

Nurse's Mercy

Reduces status ailment recovery rate by half.

Near the end of **Chapter 4**, after you've collected the exorcist swords needed to break the white barriers in Sub-Space, you can take the stairs to the lowest level (two levels below the mayor's office), where you'll find this Badge.

Hyperopia

Increases normal ranged attack power by 50% but decreases normal melee attack power by 30%.

At the end of **Chapter 4**, leave the mayor's office and go right, where you'll find the Badge in front of a Space-Time Pharmacy. Make sure you've destroyed the white barriers in Sub-Space to access this location.

Chill Days

Increases normal attack power by 25% but renders you unable to sprint.

First, clear the asylum in **Chapter 5**. Before fighting the final boss, use the Space-Time Pharmacy to fast travel to Room N301. From there, walk into the hallway, turn left, and go downstairs at the red "exit" sign. At the bottom of this staircase, you'll find the Badge.

Testosterone

Inflicts damage to enemies when dodging.

At the **start of Chapter 6**, take the path marked with a purple and golden stone. Inside the shack at the end of this path, you'll find the Testosterone Badge.

Pedro Brothers

Increases normal jump attack power by 20%.

At the **start of Chapter 6**, you'll find this Badge behind the Guru's House (left side). Take the path closest to the Space-Time Pharmacy, behind the gray and pink stones. Be sure to clear the house first, as you'll need an additional stone to reach the Badge.

Calamity Star

Increases normal ranged attack power by 20% but increases damage taken by 30%.

In the **second half of Chapter 6**, in the underground caves, you'll find a breakable wall near a Space-Time Pharmacy. Behind it is a large circular elevator platform. Go down, then wait in a nook for the elevator to go up. Cross the area below the elevator, then climb the ladders to find a purple Tesseract with the Calamity Star badge.

Vicious Shock

Increases normal attack power on weak spots by 50%.

Just before entering the boss arena **at the end of Chapter 6**, you'll find a large cave chamber with a Space-Time Pharmacy inside. Instead of walking down (where the boss is), walk in the opposite direction until you find the purple Tesseract with the Vicious Shock badge.

Booger Baby

Increases Emerald Flowsion absorption by 51%, but renders you unable to recover HP with Bloody Summer.

In **Chapter 7**, inside the mayor's office, go through the TV in the small side room (not the one near the desk). See the pillar with the yellow Space-Time Pharmacy? Drop down in that direction and you'll find a green anomaly. Fix it, then drop further down and use the TV on the ground floor to return to real space.

At the nearest Space-Time Pharmacy, teleport to the mayor's office, then head outside and enter Sub-Space again through the first TV in the hallway to your right. From here, carefully drop down to the lower ledge to find a purple Tesseract containing the Badge.

Young Old Boy

Increases normal attack power by 50% when your HP falls below 30%.

Again, use the TV in the small room adjacent to the mayor's office in **Chapter 7**, fix the two green anomalies nearest to you, then take the highest TV to teleport to a rooftop. On the left, at the bottom of the staircase, a new TV should have spawned (if it's not there, you've missed an anomaly).

In Sub-Space, walk all the way down to find an exorcist sword, then go back up and break the first white wall on your right. Drop down to grab the Badge.

Galan Esmeralda

Increases normal attack power by 100%, but Emerald Flowsion gradually decreases while your weapon is drawn. It won't activate if you have no Emerald Flowsion.

Right at the start of **Chapter 8**, before you walk upstairs, just run straight ahead into the large, square area. Open the purple Tesseract ahead.

Dr Perversion

Increases Bloody Summer's recovery amount.

Near the end of **Chapter 8**, when you reach the 3rd Sanctum, use a ladder to reach the top of the yellow-lined cube building. The Badge is on the top floor.
