Cloud and friends are making the jump to a new platform this year, as preorders are now officially live for [Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth](https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth) on Nintendo Switch 2. It's available to preorder at a variety of retailers for $49.99 ([see it here at Amazon](https://zdcs.link/a56MWO?object_uuid=00d0d9ef-015f-4a08-aa43-a0093b725354&t=article)) and is set to be released in a few months time, on June 3. But there's even more in store for fans: those who preorder this version of the game also get an exclusive Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy promo card as a bonus. That's quite a nice surprise alongside the game itself.

If you can't wait to grab the Switch 2 version (and an extra Magic: The Gathering card), head to the links below to get your preorders in.

What's included in the box is, unfortunately, a Game-Key Card, meaning the actual game isn't loaded onto the cartridge. However, putting the cart in your Switch 2 does let you download the game and is required when you want to play it. It also lets you sell the game when you're done with it, which you can't do with a digital game code.

## Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Preorder Bonuses

As far as preorder bonuses go, the Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy promo card is the most exciting one of the bunch. It features variant art of Zack Fair, drawn by Tetsuya Nomura, which you can see in the image above, and has identical abilities to the Zack Fair card found in the Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy set. This card is only available while supplies last, though, so it's well worth preordering the game now to make sure you get your hands on it.

Alongside the card, there's also a reversible inlay that comes with the physical edition of the game, and in-game items of a Posh Chocobo Summoning Materia, Armor: Shinra Bangle Mk. II, and Armor: Midgar Bangle Mk. II.

## What Is Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth?

Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is the second game in the Final Fantasy 7 remake trilogy, following [Final Fantasy 7 Remake](https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake). It's a game we adored, with our [review](https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review) from IGN's Michael Higham saying it, "impressively builds off of what Remake set in motion as both a best-in-class action-RPG full of exciting challenge and depth, and as an awe-inspiring recreation of a world that has meant so much to so many for so long." While no release date is known for it yet, the [third installment in the remake trilogy is underway](https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-card-game-queens-blood-will-be-enhanced-for-ff7-remake-part-3) as well.
