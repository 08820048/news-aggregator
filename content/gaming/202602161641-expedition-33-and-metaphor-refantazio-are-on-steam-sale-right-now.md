If you've been putting off buying _[Clair Obscur: Expedition 33](https://www.polygon.com/game/clair-obscur-expedition-33/548832/)_ or [_Metaphor: ReFantazio_](https://www.polygon.com/game/metaphor-refantazio/444905/), now's the perfect chance to get your hands on both games at a discount. Sandfall Interactive and Atlus have released a [Steam bundle](https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/66136/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33_x_Metaphor_ReFantazio/) featuring both games at 10% off. If you already own one of the two games, you can still snag whichever title is missing from your library at a 10% discount.

Even better, both games are _already_ heavily discounted. _Expedition 33_ is on sale for 10% off (taking its price from $50 to $45 _before_ the Steam bundle discount), and _Metaphor_ is 50% off (down to $35 from its usual $70). The 10% bundle discount is added on top of the pre-existing discount, meaning players can get their hands on both games for $72 rather than the $120 it would normally cost to purchase them each separately at full price.

"_Expedition 33_ is a work that conveys a deep understanding of and sincere dedication to the JRPG genre, crafted with great care down to the finest details," _Metaphor: ReFantazio_ creative director Katsura Hashino said in a news release. "As someone who also creates RPGs, I found it to be truly inspiring. I am genuinely delighted to see Japanese-style RPGs being born and embraced, not only from Japanese-based studios like ours, but other places around the world through diverse creative approaches."

Sandfall Interactive CEO and creative director Guillaume Broche shared Hashino's sentiments, adding that "_Metaphor: ReFantazio_ is a game that is really inspiring for us."

"It tells a beautiful story in a completely new world that is masterfully crafted. It deals with heavy themes but one that resonates strongly with me is the importance of imagination in all aspects of our lives. The cast is lovable and the turn-based battle system is one of the best I have played. The re-imagination of the traditional jobs system through Archetypes is fantastic and opens up so many playstyles that are fun to play around with. On top of that, the game has one of the most charismatic villains I’ve ever seen in an RPG."

This award-winning game bundle can be purchased on Steam [here](https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/66136/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33_x_Metaphor_ReFantazio/).
