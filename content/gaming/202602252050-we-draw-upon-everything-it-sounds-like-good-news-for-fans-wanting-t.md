[LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight](https://www.ign.com/games/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight) developer TT Games has shared a positive-sounding update on whether suits from the Dark Knight's brooding Ben Affleck era will be included in the game.

While the game's character roster may be limited (and [we've also got more detail on why that is, too](https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-only-has-7-playable-characters-because-they-are-more-differentiated-with-much-deeper-gameplay-ign-fan-fest-2026)), LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight will feature an enormous wardrobe of 100 Batsuits to celebrate the character's long history.

Already, there have been confirmations of Bat-clothes as worn by Robert Pattinson, Christian Bale, Val Kilmer, Michael Keaton and Adam West — but what about Ben Affleck, who portrayed the character in a handful of movies through the DCEU era, including Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Justice League.

Batfleck's Batsuit has been a key question among fans of the Caped Crusader, and one that IGN was keen to ask TT Games Head of Production and Strategic Director Jonathan Smith when we recently got a chance to find out more about the promising-looking LEGO Batman game.

"We draw upon everything across the history of the franchise into this game," Smith said when questioned specifically about references to Ben Affleck's incarnation of the character and the DCEU era overseen by director Zack Snyder. "So yeah, you've got suits and moments and vehicles that everyone will recognize from across all movies," Smith continued.

While the majority of LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight's Batsuits are being kept under wraps for players to find, TT Games has already shown off around a dozen through early trailers. We've listed everything that fans have spotted so far below, along with further details if we have them.

Other than Batfleck, are there are there any other suits you'd like to see?
