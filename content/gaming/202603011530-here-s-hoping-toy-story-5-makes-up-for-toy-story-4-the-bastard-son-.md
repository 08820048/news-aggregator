I do kinda love Forky though

Quentin Tarantino was right. Not about Paul Dano, who is a fine actor, but when he told Bill Mahr in an [interview](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBigPicture/comments/1f2vpds/quentin_tarantino_refuses_to_watch_toy_story_4/) a couple of years ago that [_Toy Story 3_](https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/29/19102537/toy-story-4-woody-pixar-movies-themes/) was the perfect way to end the series and he has no interest in seeing any more. “I don’t care if it’s good,” Tarantino said of [_Toy Story 4_](https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/13/18677569/toy-story-4-review-forky/). “I’m done!”

When I heard this clip making the rounds a couple of years back, I remember thinking that, after _Toy Story 3_, I should have been done myself. Much like I’ve made a conscious choice to ignore every Terminator film after [_T2_](https://www.polygon.com/2015/7/2/8883287/original-terminator-2-ending/), I should have wired my brain to say that there are no Toy Stories after the third one.

But I’ve grown up with these characters. I saw _Toy Story_ in theaters when I was nine and I’ve been there for every film and short and TV special since. I remember holding my breath when the toys were nearly incinerated in _Toy Story 3_ and openly crying when Andy gave Buzz and Woody to Bonnie at the end. I’ve also passed on my love for these characters to my own kid. And while this franchise has touched millions of people, as a now-adult toy collector, the connection feels extra personal to me. So when the gang returned to theaters with _Toy Story 4_, the siren call of Woody’s pull string was too great. I bought myself a ticket.

I wish I hadn’t.

    ![woody and forky in toy story 4](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16342077/p062_116c_cs.sel16.1802_RGB_FINAL.jpg?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2)Disney/Pixar

Despite the fact that _Toy Story 4_ is well written, beautifully animated and even manages to introduce some interesting new ideas to the franchise, the movie left me with a profound feeling of sadness and discomfort.

For starters, it introduces too many new characters. While every film in the franchise does this, _Toy Story 4_ was the first time the new characters almost entirely canceled out the longstanding characters we’ve loved for decades. Ironically, I actually like _all_ the new characters from _Toy Story 4_. Forky is hilarious and a truly bizarre, interesting addition to the group for how he redefines what a toy can be as a plastic spork with googly eyes and pipe cleaner hands. Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele’s characters Ducky and Bunny are also really funny, as is Duke Kaboom, Giggle McDimples and [the trio of Combat Carls](https://www.polygon.com/ernie-hudson-voiceover-career-ghostbusters-cyborg-transformers-toy-story/). But there’s only so much real estate in an hour and 40 minute film, which is why Hamm, Rex, Slinky Dog, Mr. Potato Head, Mrs. Potato Head and Bullseye are all reduced to basically cameos.

Speaking specifically of Mr. Potato Head, it’s worth mentioning that, yes, Don Rickles died before _Toy Story 4_ and Pixar used archival recordings of his voice to bring him back. The studio even did some [back-patting about this](https://geektyrant.com/news/the-late-don-rickles-will-still-voice-mr-potato-head-in-toy-story-4) in the lead up to _Toy Story 4_. But in the final cut, the character didn’t say much of anything. He’s mostly just reduced a few crowd noises with lines like “Look at that!” thrown in to remind you he’s there. This is from a guy who had _hundreds_ of hours of television and film to draw from. Forgive me if I’m not impressed.

    ![Mr. Potato threatens Woody with the Etch-A-Sketch](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/vs-toystorydisney-0-29.jpg?q=70&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=1)Image: Disney/Pixar

I also don’t like how the movie makes me feel about Bonnie. At the end of _Toy Story 3_, when Andy gives Bonnie all of his toys, there’s a beautiful scene where he tells her to take good care of them, _especially_ Woody. Yet by _Toy Story_ _4_, Woody is basically forgotten. At the end, she doesn’t even notice he’s missing, which leaves me feeling resentment towards Bonnie for breaking her promise to Andy. That’s obviously a ridiculous feeling for me to have towards an animated cartoon child, but the movie puts Bonnie in a position to be blamed.

To be clear, all of these progressions “make sense.” It’s logical that a little girl would favor Jesse over Woody, and kids outgrow toys all the time. But the problem with _Toy Story 4_ isn’t that it makes illogical choices, but that it was an entirely unnecessary chapter. It was like a TV show that went on a season too long and began to chip away at its own legacy.

    ![Toy Story 4 - Woody and Bo Peep next to arcade machine](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15971947/toy_story_4_woody_bo_peep_1920.png?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2)Pixar/Disney

Which brings me to the biggest problem I have with _Toy Story 4_: the fact that Woody leaves at the end. The movie does a nice job justifying his departure. Pretty much the entire movie leads up to him leaving his friends at the end to be with Bo Peep. But it still made me feel awful. Andy was always Woody’s most profound connection. Yet, when Andy gives him away at the end of _Toy Story 3_, it still feels right because Andy doesn’t really need him anymore and Woody still gets to be with his fellow toy friends. Even more than Andy, Woody belongs with Buzz, Slinky, Jesse and the rest of the gang.

There’s a line in _Toy Story 2_ where Woody says, “Who am I to break up the Roundup Gang?” referring to himself, Jesse, and Bullseye. Yet in _Toy Story 4_, Woody does exactly that. He breaks up the gang and it makes me feel terrible. While both _Toy Story 3_ and _Toy Story 4_ end with scenes of profound sadness and departure, that feeling is earned by the end of the original trilogy as all of those movies are about Andy growing up. Yet for _Toy Story 4_, it feels like Woody is abandoning the same friends the previous movie told us he belonged with.

That feeling has sat in my stomach since 2019.

Ever since, all I wanted was a _Toy Story 5_ to come along and fix what _Toy Story 4_ broke: bring back Woody, reunite him with his friends, and give the original supporting characters that were nearly absent from _Toy Story 4_ the attention they deserve.

So far, it looks like my prayers have been answered. Rex, Hamm and Mr. Potato Head (now voiced by the supremely talented Jeff Bergman) each get funny lines in the [first trailer for _Toy Story 5_](https://www.polygon.com/toy-story-5-trailer-woody-tom-hanks/), which is hopefully a sign that they’ll get more screentime this go-around. And speaking as a parent, the creep of tech into a child’s life feels like a great story to tell with Bonnie. I’m also all for Jesse taking center stage over Woody and Buzz, as she’s probably the only other character besides Woody with enough depth to handle a lead role.

Most importantly, already in the first full trailer, it’s been established that Woody reunites with his pals. I just hope he sticks around this time. It isn’t the Roundup Gang without him.
