Google has finally [announced its newest A-series phone](https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/devices/pixel/google-pixel-10a/), the Pixel 10a, which brings a variety of minor upgrades over [last year's 9a](https://www.ign.com/articles/google-pixel-9a-review). The phone is now available to preorder and will ship on March 5.

The Pixel 10a is identical to the 9a in many areas, offering the same Tensor G4 chip and 8GB of RAM, a 6.3" OLED display with support for up to 120Hz refresh rates, and a 5,100mAh battery. It's all exceedingly familiar stuff at a glance, but there are a few tweaks that are likely to make it worth the upgrade — at least for those still sporting older phones. There's also a pretty good preorder available deal for those who buy early.

Releases March 5

### Google Pixel 10a (128GB)

Includes free Pixel Buds 2a or a $100 gift card.

The most notable of the Pixel 10a's improvements over the 9a include a move to Gorilla Glass 7i to dramatically enhance durability, slight upgrades to brightness and contrast for better outdoor viewing, and faster charging speeds to help you stay topped off when necessary. Additionally, the 10a is the first of the A-series phones to receive Bluetooth 6.0 and [Satellite SOS](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15254448?hl=en) support.

If you preorder the Pixel 10a from the [Google Store](https://store.google.com/config/pixel_10a?hl=en-US) or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GJ7NSD6M?th=1), you can either opt for a bundle containing free Pixel Buds 2a or a bundle with a $100 gift card for the respective storefront. Meanwhile, [Best Buy](https://www.bestbuy.com/product/google-pixel-10a-128gb-unlocked-obsidian/J39TC8CKQW) simply offers a $100 gift card with your preorder, with no option containing the Pixel Buds 2a.

Given that the Pixel Buds 2a will run you $130 when purchased separately, it may be best to go with the Google Store or Amazon bundle if scoring a set of these popular earbuds is already on your to-do list. Otherwise, we recommend going with the $100 gift card at the retailer of your choice.

Regardless of where you preorder the Pixel 10a, you'll be able to choose between the 128GB version for $499 or the 256GB version for $599. The phone comes in four colorways: Obsidian, Lavender, Berry, and Fog. However, as of this writing, Best Buy is only offering the 256GB version in Obsidian or Lavender, so you'll need to stick with the Google Store or Amazon if you want the higher storage capacity in one of the other two colors.
