DC is continuing to expand the wildly popular Absolute Universe line in 2026. At the Comics Pro retailer convention, the publisher gave readers their first good look at the latest two Absolute spinoffs, Absolute Green Arrow and Absolute Catwoman.

Absolut Green Arrow is written by Pornsak Pichetshote and illustrated by Rafael Albuquerque. The first issue features covers by Albuquerque, Gerald Parel, Guillem March, Reiko Murakami, and Tula Lotay. Check out a preview in the slideshow gallery below:

This six-issue series spins out of the events of [last year's Absolute Evil one-shot](https://www.ign.com/articles/dc-reveals-why-absolute-joker-is-fundamentally-different-from-every-other-version). That issue introduced the Absolute version of Oliver Queen, only for this well-meaning but deeply naive hero to be immediately murdered by a corrupted Hawkman. Absolute Green Arrow instead takes a more horror-influenced approach to the franchise, as a mysterious vigilante begins killing off billionaires and protection specialist Dinah Lance (aka Absolute Black Canary) is dispatched to uncover the archer's secret identity.

Absolute Green Arrow #1 will be released on May 20, 2026.

As for Absolute Catwoman, that series is co-written by Che Grayson and Scott Snyder and illustrated by Bengal. The first issue features covers by Bengal, David Nakayama, Sozomaika, Kaare Andrews, and Mateus Manhanini. See an early preview in the slideshow gallery below:

Absolute Catwoman spins out of the pages of Snyder's Absolute Batman series, which revealed Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle to be childhood friends-turned-lovers. As the series opens, Selina is enjoying her hard-won reputation as the world's greatest cat burglar. But when an enemy from her past comes calling, she'll find herself suddenly on the defensive.

Absolute Catwoman #1 will be released on June 10, 2026.

In addition to these two new books, DC also teased that the first Absolute Universe event comic will debut in Q4 2026. Look for more news on that series in the months ahead.
