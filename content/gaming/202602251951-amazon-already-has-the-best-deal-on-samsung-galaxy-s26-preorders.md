Samsung has [officially announced](https://www.ign.com/articles/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2026-everything-announced) its highly-anticipated Galaxy S26 lineup of smartphones with a release date of March 11. With the powerful new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip serving up meaningfully better performance, as well as a larger battery, more base storage, and other quality-of-life improvements, the Galaxy S26 is already turning some heads in the tech arena. And if you're interested in grabbing one, the entire Galaxy S26 family is already available for preorder.

Free Storage Upgrade + Gift Card

### Samsung Galaxy S26 (512GB)

Includes a free $100 Amazon gift card.

You can preorder the Samsung S26 from the [official Samsung site](https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s26/buy/galaxy-s26-512gb-unlocked-sku-sm-s942uzvfxaa/) or via [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Unlocked-Smartphone-Processor-Immersive/dp/B0GHBJP6QQ/?th=1). If you're looking for the best bang for your buck, though, we'd recommend the latter, as Amazon is offering the most appealing deal for the Samsung S26: extra storage and a gift card. Those extras are going to be hard to pass up.

By preordering the Samsung S26 from Amazon, you can upgrade to 512GB at no additional cost while also netting yourself a $100 Amazon gift card. This deal is available across every phone in the Galaxy S26 family, including the Ultra, making this the most affordable way to get your hands on the most powerful device in Samsung's new lineup.

The Samsung Galaxy S26 is available in six colors: Black, White, Cobalt Violet, Sky Blue, Silver Shadow, and Pinkgold. Note, however, that Silver Shadow and Pinkgold are online exclusives that require you buy the phone directly from Samsung. So, if you're adamant about getting your hands on one of those two colorways, you'll have to pass on the Amazon deal.

Amazon's deal lasts until March 10, just one day before the phone's official release, so you've got a bit of time to make a decision. That being said, we don't know how long supplies will last, so it might be better to take the plunge sooner rather than later if you're in dire need of an upgrade.

### Samsung Galaxy Buds 4 are also available to preorder

Includes a free gift card

### Samsung Galaxy Buds 4

In addition to the new lineup of Galaxy phones, Samsung also revealed the new Galaxy Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro. The new earbuds follow up the [Galaxy Buds Pro 3](https://www.ign.com/articles/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review) which were released back in 2024.
