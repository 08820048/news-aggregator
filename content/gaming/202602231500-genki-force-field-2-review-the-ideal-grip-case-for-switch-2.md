Genki’s Force Field 2 might just be the the ideal grip case for the [Switch 2](https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review). While its handles don’t add a _ton_ of extra grip, the overall package confers a phenomenal level of convenience and portability, while still protecting my as-of-yet unscathed Switch 2. And with small perks like game cartridge storage and a MagSafe ring, this could well be my new go-to [Switch 2 accessory](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-2-accessories) for solo travel.

Keeping with Genki’s sleek, understated-but-stylish branding, the Force Field 2 encloses the Switch 2 with a pair of semi-transparent, dark-grey pieces. The back covers the Joy-Cons and the console itself, with small, rounded handles adding a pair of small grips to the console in handheld mode. And instead of attaching each grip to the Joy-Cons, this case attaches its Joy-Con covers to the back panel itself, with hinges that snap on and off of the controllers while they are attached to the tablet.

This setup makes disconnecting a Joy-Con 2 from the console easier and more convenient compared to detaching a grip that’s attached to each controller individually, which comes in handy for for tabletop and mouse mode play. Folding open each grip reveals yet another efficient design idea, with a game cartridge storage slot that cleverly utilizes each handle.

The back panel that anchors these folding grips to the console itself snaps on tightly to the tablet, hugging it tightly enough to slide into the official Switch 2 dock. It’s kind of a tight fit, but it shouldn’t scratch your screen or anything. It also leaves space for the Switch 2’s improved kickstand. But my favorite feature for the entire case – aside from the protection it offers, of course – is right above that kickstand slot.

MagSafe? On my Switch 2 case? It's more likely than you think.

The MagSafe ring situated in the middle of the back panel alone makes this case well worth the cost. The Switch 2’s battery life seriously kneecaps its portability; even if you’re not playing in one long session, it’s always a bummer to click on your Switch for some time-melting [Balatro](https://www.ign.com/games/balatro) on a short flight or train ride only to discover that you forgot to fully charge your console. Here’s where the MagSafe ring comes in: it allows you to attach a portable battery to your Switch without needing to tether yourself to a USB port or outlet.

Genki conveniently sells a slim, powerful portable charger (which also works wirelessly with devices like smartphones) that snaps onto this magnetic ring, and ships with a well-shaped, male-to-male USB-C cable with right-angled ends, letting you charge the console with minimal interference to your playtime. You can also use other MagSafe chargers. In addition to Genki’s portable charger, I’ve also used other MagSafe chargers, like one of Pitaka's Aramid Fiber power banks, with great results. However, I needed to use a different USB-C connector, because its placement and design were made for Genki’s proprietary charger.

The other half of the case comes with considerably fewer bells and whistles, serving as a simple cover designed to protect the console, including its screen and controllers. It snaps to the console with the other half of the case attached, providing a smooth, rounded cover that envelops the console to sit flush with the rest of the case. It’s a smooth, sturdy, protective barrier that doesn’t offer the same suite of flashy features as the other half of the case, but doesn’t need to. It could use its space more efficiently, with more game cartridge storage in the space between the screen and case, though it’s by no means a dealbreaker.

The full case adds less than an inch to the Switch 2 in total, too, keeping everything slim and low-profile, making it easy to store and pack. Even with Genki’s roughly half-inch-thick portable charger on the console, it’s still pretty slim and easy to throw into your bag.

### Verdict

Genki’s Force Field 2 Switch 2 case is probably going to stay on my console for some time. With convenient solutions for all modes of play and a well-designed and implemented MagSafe ring, I plan on keeping it snugly affixed to my console anytime I travel alone. While I do wish it had more space to store game cartridges or maybe even the Joy-Con 2 straps, it’s otherwise a spectacular case, boasting premium features and an efficient use of space.
