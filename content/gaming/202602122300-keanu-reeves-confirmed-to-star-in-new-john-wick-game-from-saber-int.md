Saber Interactive has announced a new [John Wick](https://www.ign.com/games/john-wick) game, featuring the voice and likeness of Keanu Reeves.

As well as PlayStation 5, the game will also be coming to PC and Xbox Series X/S, though an official title as well as any sense of a launch date are currently unknown.

Here's a first official blurb:

"Created in collaboration between Saber, Lionsgate, and franchise director Chad Stahelski, the new 'Untitled John Wick Game' will feature an original script set in the John Wick timeline, expanding on the franchise's intricate lore with familiar characters fans already know, as well as completely new ones.

"Saber's design will be faithful to the unique style and signature elements of the series, including a distinct gun fu combat system, jaw-dropping camerawork, immersive driving experiences, and a variety of memorable environments, all crafted to make players feel like they are in a John Wick movie, playing the role of John Wick himself."

And yes, Keanu Reeves is back in the role for this project, with a statement from Saber Interactive confirming that the Matrix star is signed on to "reprise his iconic character’s look, voice and more."
