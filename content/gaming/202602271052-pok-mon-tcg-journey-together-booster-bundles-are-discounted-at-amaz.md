Amazon is going through something of a massive [restocking mission this week for Pokémon cards](https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-restocks-a-whole-bunch-of-pokemon-cards-on-pokemon-day), and it comes at just the right time for Pokémon Day and the 30th anniversary celebrations.

There's a whole bunch of [great deals already live (including discounts on cards, games, and toys)](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-day-deals-2026), but I wanted to draw attention to one of the best deals out there right now as well.

That's on the [Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet - Journey Together Booster Bundle](https://zdcs.link/QLp88b?object_uuid=e27e3365-4715-4d9e-8688-941f8b7b28ea&t=article), which is now back in stock at Amazon, and with a significant reduction to boot.

Amazing Deal!

### Pokémon TCG: Journey Together Booster Bundle

Now just $34.97, this is one of the best prices I've ever seen for six Journey Together boosters, and well worth picking up as part of the celebrations today. It includes six boosters, which works out at around $5.82 per pack.

I can also see these selling out _fast_ today, so snap one up ASAP to avoid disappointment.

Market price on these bad boys is around [$37.87 right now at TCGplayer](https://zdcs.link/QV5XEO?object_uuid=e27e3365-4715-4d9e-8688-941f8b7b28ea&t=article), and you're getting free delivery if you're a Prime member. I'd say that's a pretty great offering, all things considered.

Walmart was selling a similar deal earlier this week, but locked access to it initially behind its paid Walmart+ membership. That's frustrating for those who don't already have a membership and don't want to pay an extra $75 to get access to a deal like this.

Thankfully, with the restock at Amazon and the latest discount being price-matched, all Pokémon fans can enjoy the offer today as part of the 30th anniversary celebrations.

But, I must note that this is still slightly above MSRP for a booster bundle ($26.94), so keep that in mind before making your purchase.
