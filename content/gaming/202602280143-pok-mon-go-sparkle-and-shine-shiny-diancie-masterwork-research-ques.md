As part of the ticketed portion of "**Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos**," players can get a **Masterwork Research** set that rewards **Shiny Diancie** in [_Pokémon Go_](http://www.polygon.com/game/pokemon-go/38713/), starting at 10 a.m. in your local time on Feb. 28. As with other Masterwork Research, these tasks are a lot of work — and they're meant to be so, as you have an unlimited amount of time to finish them and the reward is great.

Below we list the steps for the **shiny Diancie "Sparkle and Shine" Masterwork Research**.

## Should you pay for the 'Sparkle and Shine' Masterwork Research?

Notably, shiny Diancie has only been distributed twice before this: once in Japan in 2015 and again in South Korea in 2016, making this particular Pokémon very rare. While it is frustrating that this research is locked behind a $10 price tag (as you need the $9.99 Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos event ticket to get it), this is a pretty unique opportunity to grab a hard-to-find Pokémon.

**If you really love Diancie and want the shiny version, yes, you should buy the pass.** It's very likely that shiny Diancie will come back in another paid ticket down the line, if you miss your chance to buy this one. ([Shiny Jirachi](https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/23608501/jirachi-wish-granted-masterwork-research-tasks-steps-rewards/)'s research came back later on, but it did take a few years.)

Additionally, if you're somebody who wants to use Diancie in battles and the stats you rolled on the previously-rewarded, non-shiny [Diancie from 2024](https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/24146352/glitz-and-glam-diancie-special-research/) weren't good, then you can always try your luck with this one.

All in all, the perks from the "Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos" event as a whole are pretty nice, so I would mostly consider this as a bonus perk alongside the other stuff, like the increased shiny rate. If you don't plan on playing at all doing Go Tour, then it still could be worth it, if you really care about Diancie, as mentioned above.

The next step has yet to be revealed due to the time gate in the previous step. We'll update this guide with more information once the next steps are revealed.

If you're spending the day out playing the "Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos" event, we have guides for you. You can check out our [habitat and Mega Raid schedule](https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-tour-kalos-event-habitat-schedule-spawns-bonuses/), as well as our post listing the steps to the ["An X-ceptional Yarn" Special Research](https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-tour-kalos-x-y-xerneas-yveltal-special-research/). As you head out, you might want to brush up on what the deal is with [Super Mega Raids](https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-super-mega-raids-link-charges-how-to-get/), as that's the new key feature as part of this event.

Of course, there are also some [codes to redeem](https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-tour-kalos-redeem-codes-unown/) for a limited time that reward Unown, [Sylveon](https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide-very-fairy-timed-research-code-redeem/), and the Kalos starters, so you should do that, too.
