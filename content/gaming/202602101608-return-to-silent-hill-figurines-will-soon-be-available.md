On the bright side, you can probably use them to play-act a better adaptation of Silent Hill 2

## The terrible Silent Hill movie is getting action figures

Figurine-maker Zombie Sailor's Toys is partnering with Konami to produce action figures based on [_Return to Silent Hill_](https://www.polygon.com/return-to-silent-hill-destroys-three-characters-angela/), Christophe Gans' latest attempt at adapting the Silent Hill franchise into a film.

"Zombie Sailor's Toys is proud to announce officially licensed _Return to Silent Hill_ action figures, inspired by the newly released film — in theaters now — and drawn from one of the most iconic horror franchises of all time," an update on the toy manufacturer's website reads. "As lifelong Silent Hill fans, we went all in — delivering screen-accurate sculpts, haunting likenesses, and the obsessive attention to detail you've come to expect from Zombie Sailor's Toys."

Per Zombie Sailor, the characters from the film who will be immortalized in toy form are:

• James Sunderland

• Pyramid Head

• The Nurses

• The Armless

Interestingly, _Return to Silent Hill_ is meant to be a faithful adaptation of [_Silent Hill 2_](https://www.polygon.com/game/silent-hill-2/5991/), but [The Armless](https://silenthill.fandom.com/wiki/Armless_Man) don't exist in the game. They only appear in the film franchise, but are heavily based on Silent Hill 2's [Lying Figure](https://silenthill.fandom.com/wiki/Lying_Figure). Based on the product description, the James Sunderland figurine will take on a similar look to that of actor [Jeremy Irving](https://www.polygon.com/23641442/return-to-silent-hill-2-cast-james-sunderland-maria/), who portrayed a version of James with long, shaggy hair, various pieces of silver jewelry, and a penchant for smoking joints in his Mustang. The nurses, presumably, will feature the strange holes in their faces that are only seen in their _Return to Silent Hill_ cameo.

The figurines are part of a limited-edition run, and will be available for purchase via the [Zombie Sailor's Toys website](https://zombiesailor.com/blogs/news/return-to-silent-hill-zombie-sailors-toys) sometime this month.
