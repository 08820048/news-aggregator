When you think of the best Switch and Switch 2 games, there’s a good chance you might not immediately think of platforming royalty like Super Mario Galaxy and Galaxy 2 being playable on Nintendo’s most recent generations of hardware, but they’re here and still just as good as ever.

If you’ve somehow missed out on them, then good news - [Amazon has discounted the physical version of the double pack by around $10](https://zdcs.link/zE8ypM?object_uuid=f06b8ad1-6fe3-49ec-a515-29d06445a444&t=article), but it’s not immediately obvious.

### Super Mario Galaxy Double Pack

## Save $10 on the Super Mario Galaxy Double Pack on Switch and Switch 2

Essentially, the pricing can’t be seen on the Amazon listing until it’s added to your cart, so there’s not much of an indication that it’s discounted to $59.

Once you add it to your checkout items, though, you’ll see that you’re getting two of the best platformers in the history of the medium for $30 each. Whether you’ve played them before or want to jump in ahead of the movie release, that’s a great deal.

Back in 2007, we awarded a [9.7 out of 10 for the first game](https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-galaxy-review), calling it “The pinnacle of three-dimensional run-and-jump gameplay.”

Fast-forward three years, and IGN awarded the sequel, Super Mario Galaxy 2, a 10 out of 10, going even further and saying “Mario Galaxy 2 is the pinnacle of Mario games: everything that makes them so incredibly fun is represented here.”

That’s some praise, if we do say so ourselves, and it’s likely the best way to play the games without breaking out the Wii.
