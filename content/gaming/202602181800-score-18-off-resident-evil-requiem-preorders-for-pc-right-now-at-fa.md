### Resident Evil Requiem

Resident Evil Requiem looks like it's shaping up to be quite a thrilling chapter in the horror series, too. Our [final preview](https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-the-final-preview) from IGN's Dale Driver said it "appears to be a fantastically constructed tribute to everything that makes the series so great. Do you like tense survival horror? It’s here. Wanna go all guns blazing with intense action and a quip-obsessed hero? You get that too. Do you prefer playing RE games in first or third person? Doesn’t matter; you can do either."

For those who enjoy the tense survival horror aspects of Resident Evil, our [second-take preview](https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-second-take-preview) from IGN's Michael Higham also noted that "not only does Grace’s side of Requiem evoke a petrifying sense of dread atop the classic puzzle-solving of the series, it’s also a fantastic expression of the kind of stealth-action gameplay I’ve been wanting for a while."

For PC players, this is a great opportunity to preorder Resident Evil Requiem for your Steam library and save some cash in the process.
