Amazon is once again having a sale on Ravensburger puzzles, which means right now is a great time to pick up your next 1000 or 2000-piece project. These sales only come around every few months or so and I always try to take advantage of them to stock up on new puzzles for me or my parents. Ravensburger is one of the [best puzzle brands](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-brands), but you'll rarely find them on sale at your local toy store unless you're buying used.

All of the puzzles currently on sale are discounted via [Amazon's Lightning Deal system](https://www.ign.com/wikis/amazon-prime/How_to_Find_Amazon_Coupons#Lightning_Deals). There isn't any sort of timer on the discount, but there is a limited amount of stock available for each puzzle. Once that limit is reached, the discount will disappear and that puzzle will jump back up to whatever it was priced at before. So if you see something you like, don't hesitate to pick it up before the deal is gone!

## Ravensburger Puzzle Sale at Amazon Today

All of the Ravensburger puzzles on sale right now are at least 30% off, with some options discounted by almost 50% right now. That means the more expensive jigsaw puzzles are getting the biggest overall price cuts in the sale. If you've got the table space and attention span for a 2000+ piece puzzle, those are the ones I'd recommend grabbing first. There's even a nice [Lord of the Rings puzzle](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-lord-of-the-rings-puzzles) discounted here that I'd recommend to all you Tolkien fans out there.

There are also quite a few 1000 piece puzzles discounted here, which is generally the piece count I'd recommend for adults. It's still challenging, but a lot more doable in a casual setting. The [bigger puzzles](https://www.ign.com/articles/largest-jigsaw-puzzles), like that 4000-piece Fairy puzzle I've featured here are better for folks who have immense amounts of time and patience to dedicate to a single puzzle project. You'll also likely need a fairly substantial [puzzle table](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-tables) for such an undertaking.

### Is Ravensburger the best puzzle brand?

Plenty of different brands make puzzles, but [Ravensburger](https://ravensburger.us/) is widely considered one of the very best jigsaw puzzle brands out there since it released its first puzzle back in 1964. This is in part due to the quality of each puzzle. The patented "Softclick" technology allows for you to hear an audible click each time you place a piece in the right place. Ravensburger also uses high-quality materials for each puzzle ensuring the pieces won't be bent or broken when you open the box.

The company also has partnerships with both Disney and Warner Bros. that allows it to make some of the best franchise-specific puzzles around. [Star Wars](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-puzzles), Frozen, Lord of the Rings, DC comics, and more jigsaw puzzles like those will often come from Ravensburger.

You may also recognize Ravensburger as one of the more popular board game brands out there. They recently got into the trading card game as the official creator and publisher of the [Disney Lorcana TCG](https://www.ign.com/games/disney-lorcana).
