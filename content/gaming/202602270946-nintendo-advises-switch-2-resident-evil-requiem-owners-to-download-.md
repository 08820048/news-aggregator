Nintendo has advised fans to ensure they have Resident Evil Requiem's day one patch installed before beginning the game on Switch 2.

The [Resident Evil Requiem](https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem) "Day 1 Patch" will bring the game up to Version 1.1.0, Nintendo said, in an update issued in the early hours of the game's launch day today, February 27.

In a [note](https://www.nintendo.com/jp/topics/article/cf4e32a9-9968-48d6-86be-c6744253ede1) on its official website, Nintendo said Version 1.1.0 included "several fixes," though did not go into further detail. "Please be sure to apply the 'Day 1 Patch' before playing the game," it continued. It's likely the update will begin updating automatically — though be sure to connect online to receive it.

Resident Evil Requiem is the first new Resident Evil game to simultaneously debut on a Nintendo platform in many years — since Resident Evil: Revelations on 3DS back in 2012. In the meantime, Nintendo platforms have received cloud versions and various belated ports — and indeed, Resident Evil 7 and Village also both launch for Switch 2 today.

In a recent video interview published to Nintendo's [YouTube](https://t.co/7mvmM5IylO) channel, Requiem director Koshi Nakanishi admitted that [the game's development team had been "skeptical" about Switch 2's ability to run the game](https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-director-admits-capcom-was-initially-skeptical-about-nintendo-switch-2-performance) — but quickly decided it would be able to run the full game "as-is" after seeing the hybrid console's horsepower in action.

"Like the result of an experiment conducted in an underground Umbrella Corporation lab, Resident Evil Requiem successfully splices two separate strains of survival horror together into the one highly infectious new mutation," IGN wrote in our [Resident Evil Requiem review](https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-review), awarding the game 9/10.
