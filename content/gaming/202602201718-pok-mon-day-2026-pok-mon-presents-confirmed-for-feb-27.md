The Pokémon Company will reveal the latest [Pokémon](https://www.polygon.com/pokemon/) news during a new Pokémon Presents showcase on Feb. 27, [the company confirmed Friday](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/watch-the-new-pokemon-presents-this-pokemon-day-on-february-27-2026). That's not much of a surprise — the annual [Pokémon Day](https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-day-2026-when-what-to-expect/) celebration typically features a new Pokémon Presents livestream, and this year will be no different.

The first Pokémon Presents of 2026 will be streamed live on Friday, Feb. 27, starting at 6 a.m. PST/9 a.m. EST. Pokémon fans can tune into the official Pokémon [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@pokemon), [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/pokemon), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pokemon/), and [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@pokemonofficial/) channels to see what's in store for the franchise's 30th anniversary.

The Pokémon Company already got one announcement out of the way by [announcing Game Boy Advance games _Pokémon FireRed_ and _LeafGreen_ for Nintendo Switch](https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-fire-red-leaf-green-switch-announcement/), a full week ahead of Pokémon Day 2026. Hopefully, that portends bigger news for the actual Pokémon Presents itself.

But as for what to expect, we'll likely get updates on games like _Pokémon Champions_ and _Pokémon Pokopia_, as well as live-service games like _Pokémon Go_, _Pokémon TCG Pocket_, and _Pokémon Unite_. Maybe we'll even get a peek at the next generation of Pokémon. It's been more than three years since the release of [_Pokémon Scarlet_ and _Violet_](https://www.polygon.com/game/pokemon-scarlet-violet/40854/), which introduced the ninth generation of Pokémon from the Paldea region. Of course, there are plenty of other Pokémon-related announcements that could show up, as the franchise continues to grow beyond video games and the trading card game, and further into film, television, in-person experiences, and physical merchandise.

For a look back at what The Pokémon Company announced last year, check out Polygon's [roundup of news from Pokémon Presents for Pokémon Day 2025](https://www.polygon.com/gaming/530900/pokemon-day-2025-news/).
