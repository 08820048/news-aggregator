Riftbound, the [League of Legends trading card game](https://www.ign.com/articles/new-league-of-legends-tcg-riftbound-has-posted-explosive-early-growth-since-launch-with-searches-surging-over-300), has just launched its latest expansion, Spiritforged, in the West. Like Origins before it, there are a handful of different products you can buy to crack packs and build out your collection.

But also like Origins, getting your hands on sealed product was tough, with stores and even Riot's own merch store selling out fast. With Spiritforged, you can pre-purchase these products on [TCGplayer,](https://www.tcgplayer.com/) although at significant markups, so just keep that in mind.

## Riftbound: Spiritforged - Where to Buy

[Riot's online merch storefront](https://merch.riotgames.com/en-us/category/riftbound/?page=1&sort=dateDesc) still has each item at MSRP, and will likely resupply their preorder stock soon, even if it's currently sold out, so be sure to check back often and sign up for a Riot account.

Otherwise, as always, one of the best ways to buy any TCG product is through your **local game store**, and Riftbound is no different. Be sure to utilize the [official store locator](https://locator.riftbound.uvsgames.com/stores/search) to find shops in your area and support local businesses.

[Spiritforged](https://www.ign.com/articles/riot-games-reveals-new-riftbound-spiritforged-cards-and-details-at-pax-unplugged) has four main products with its upcoming launch, with a total of 221 new cards to play with. You can get individual booster packs, each containing 14 cards to bolster your collection; you'll receive seven commons, three uncommons, one rare, one foil of any rarity, another random foil or rare, and either one token or Rune card.

One booster pack is currently going for $14.75 on TCGplayer. Then you can pick up a booster box, which is a sealed box of 24 booster box. With boxes, drop rates aren't entirely random. One in three boxes will contain an alternate art Overnumbered edition, while one in 30 will contain an ultra rare signed version. From here, you can purchase a booster display case, which is a collection of six booster boxes, if you can stomach the price.

For newer players, you can two preconstructed Spiritforged Champion decks. Fiora and Rumble are the Champion decks this time around, featuring a 56-card prebuilt decks focused on their respective mechanics. You'll receive their Legend card, their corresponding Chosen Champion cards, their Signature Spells, three Battlefields, and a Spiritforged booster pack.
