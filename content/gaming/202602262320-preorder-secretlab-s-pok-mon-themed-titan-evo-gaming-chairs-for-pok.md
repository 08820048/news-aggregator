Secretlab recently opened up preorders for its highly anticipated lineup of [Titan Evo Pokémon gaming chairs](https://www.ign.com/articles/now-you-can-show-off-your-favorite-pokmon-on-a-secretlab-titan-evo-gaming-chair), and what better time to pick up one of these coveted chairs than on Pokemon Day. None of these chairs are discounted (and I don't expect any sale to happen in 2026), but you don't have very many options anyway. In fact, this is the only officially licensed Pokemon themed gaming chair that's sold in the United States.

### Titan Evo Pokemon Pikachu Edition

These chairs showcase one of three iconic Pokémon - Gengar, Pikachu, and Eevee - with ostentatious use of color, patterns, and figures. My personal favorite is the Eevee edition, with its detailed embossing of Eevee's myriad evolutions; it also seems to be the top seller, since it's already on its third wave of preorders. You do pay a premium for the branding. The Titan Evo normally sells for $599, but the Pokemon models add on an $85 surcharge. Honestly though, if you're a Pokémon superfan, it's totally worth it considering the fact that this is a high quality officially licensed product.

Unusual for a collab, Secretlab opted to go with its Softweave Plus fabric instead of leatherette, and I for one am happy with that decision. Fabric ages more gracefully, feels softer, and doesn't stick to your sweaty skin on hot days. Titan Evo features a solid steel frame with aluminum wheelbase, firm and supportive cold-cure foam for the seat base, four-way adjustable lumbar system, full length backrest with 165 degrees of recline, full metal 4D armrests with magnetically attached PU cushions, and a memory foam headrest pillow.

### The Titan Evo is an excellent gaming chair

It's no secret that we love our Secretlab gaming chairs. Three of the eight chairs in our [best gaming chair](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-gaming-chairs) roundup are Secretlab models. Of all the gaming chairs we covered in our "[Budget to Best](https://www.ign.com/videos/the-best-gaming-chairs-early-2023-budget-to-best)" roundup video earlier, my colleague Akeem Lawanson considered the Titan Evo to be the most comfortable. No good chair comes cheap and Secretlab chairs definitely cost a premium, but we think the craftsmanship, materials, and customizability are worth it.

In our [Secretlab Titan Evo review](https://www.ign.com/articles/secretlab-titan-evo-2022-review), Chris Coke wrote that "after two years of daily use, the Secretlab Titan Evo has proven that it can stand the test of time and still be one of the best gaming chairs you can buy. Meaningful ergonomics paired with Secretlab’s wide selection of designs, it remains a fantastic option, especially for fans of bright colors or designs."

### Treat yourself to Secretlab's new recliner add-on

[![Secretlab Titan Recliner Add-On](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/12/secretlabrecliner-1731444678694.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/Qxx5XP?object_uuid=a23d5e56-f0d5-4262-8f41-11086545f5ac&t=article "Secretlab Titan Recliner Add-On")

### Secretlab Titan Recliner Add-On

Secretlab's recently released [recliner add-on](https://zdcs.link/QGVkVV?object_uuid=a23d5e56-f0d5-4262-8f41-11086545f5ac&t=article) is a quality of life upgrade. It installs easily onto the Titan Evo chair without any tools required, offers 80 degrees of adjustability, and is filled with cushy memory foam. If you recline often in your chair, you'll finally be able to kick your legs up without the need to buy a separate stool. In our [recliner review](https://www.ign.com/articles/secretlab-ergonomic-recliner-add-on-review), Chris Coke wrote that "while both comfort and value are subjective things, the recliner is able to take the Titan Evo and transform it from one of the best racing style gaming chairs to standing head and shoulders above the competition at its price point."
