Women in Games today has launched a new manifesto calling for "rebalancing gender representation and fairness across the global video games industry."

"At a time when games are the most influential storytelling medium in the world, the Manifesto addresses a persistent imbalance: while women make up nearly half of all players, they represent fewer than a third of the industry's workforce," the organization stated. "The Women in Games Manifesto sets out to change that by positioning equality not as an aspiration, but as a strategic and cultural necessity for the future of games."

As part of this pledge, Women in Games has outlined 14 "core reasons" why it believes empowering women in games is "critical, linking inclusive game development directly to innovation, creativity, sustainability, and culture impact."

Those reasons are listed as:

1.  Women have long been marginalized in games, it's time to change the game
2.  Equality in games is equality in culture
3.  Women's economic equality is good for business and good for games
4.  Collaboration is our strongest tool for change
5.  Every woman deserves fair treatment, far pay, and far opportunity - from the classroom to the boardroom
6.  Belonging is not optional - it's essential
7.  The future of technology must be built by everyone
8.  Women's creativity defines the next era of storytelling
9.  Intersectionality matters
10.  Sexism, harassment, and toxicity have no place in our industry, or our commitments
11.  Wellbeing is a fairness issue
12.  Diversity drives sustainability
13.  Education and mentoryshop unlock possibility and power
14.  Fairness benefits everyone.

"Progress does not happen by accident – it happens when people come together with clarity, courage, and purpose," said Women in Games CEO Dr Marie-Claire Isaaman. "The Women in Games Manifesto is a living commitment to rebalancing the scales and ensuring that women are not only part of the future of games, but are helping to design it.

"As the industry looks toward futures shaped by AI, virtual worlds, and the metaverse, who builds those systems matters. Fairness is not charity - it is strategy. When women thrive, the industry thrives. This Manifesto is an invitation to the entire ecosystem to build a fair playing field together."
