The **_Arc Raiders_** **"A Dead End" quest** is one that has multiple steps, some of which are very easy to get stuck on. Shani has you searching for Mantikor's underground facilities, then when you get there, you need to use three batteries to open a locked room, interact with a couple of different items, _and_ you have to do it all in one round.

Sound complicated? That's because it is, but we're here to help. Here's a **complete walkthrough for "A Dead End"** in [_Arc Raiders_](https://www.polygon.com/game/arc-raiders/443837/).

## 'A Dead End' quest steps in Arc Raiders

Here are all five quest steps for 'A Dead End' that you need to complete in one round of _Arc Raiders_:

1.  Find Mantikor's underground facilities.
2.  Find a way into the locked room in the Security Wing.
3.  Search the locked room for any records on Project Heartwood.
4.  Find the Dusty Film Reel.
5.  Deliver the Dusty Film Reel to Shani.

Below, we explain where you need to go and what you need to do to complete each step.

## Where to find Mantikor's underground facilities

    ![The left-hand side of the image shows the player standing in the lobby of the Mantikor underground facilities while the right-hand side shows the Reinforced Reception location marked on in the in-game map with a star.](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/arc-raiders-a-dead-end-location.jpg?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2)Graphic: Ford James/Polygon Images: Embark Studios via Polygon

First up is finding Mantikor's underground facilities. This one is simple when you know where to go, but you'll only know that if you know Blue Gate like the back of your hand. Open your map and look for the **Reinforced Reception** point of interest.

Head inside when you get here and take the zipline down to the basement. The big Mantikor sign on the wall implies one thing: you've found their underground facilities.

## How to get into the locked room in the Security Wing

    ![The left-hand side of the image shows the player carrying a battery cell and standing in front of the locked door while the right-hand side shows the location of the door marked on the in-game map with a star.](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/arc-raiders-a-dead-end-locked-door.jpg?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2)Graphic: Ford James/Polygon | Source images: Embark Studios via Polygon

Now that you're inside the underground facilities, you need to find the locked room. From the lobby with the big Mantikor logo on the wall, follow the blue line on the floor. This will take you down a tunnel where you'll find a huge shuttered door that requires three battery cells to open on your right-hand side.

    ![The left-hand image shows the battery cell location at the top of the stairs while the right-hand image shows the one downstairs.](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/arc-raiders-a-dead-end-battery-cells.jpg?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2)Images: Embark Studios via Polygon

Luckily for you, the three battery cells required are always found together. What's unlucky, on the other hand, is that they're not always in the same location. In our experience, they're in one of two places:

-   Follow the red line from the lobby up the stairs and you may find them next to the small circular passage with the huge pipe running above.
-   They may also be downstairs in the room underneath, at the end of a line of filing cabinets.

Either way, all three batteries will be together, so you just need to ferry them back and forth. We've run this a few times to check and it has always been one of the two locations, but there may be more we haven't found. The Security Wing section of the underground facility is small though, so you shouldn't have to look too far.

## Where to find the Project Heartwood records and Dusty Film Reel

Now you're inside the locked red room, there's plenty of great loot in here, but for the quest, head to the back-right corner. There'll be a prompt to play a recording, so interact with that, and the screens at the front of the room will come to life. Cross over to the other side and search the cabinet to find the Dusty Film Reel.

Pick it up — ideally in your safe pocket so you can return it to Shani without losing it — then get the heck outta dodge to complete the quest.
