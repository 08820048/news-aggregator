## How to get Emerald Flowsion in Romeo Is a Dead Man

Luckily, there are several ways to obtain Emerald Flowsion in _Romeo Is a Dead Man_. Defeating enemies is the most common way, but make sure you don't miss out on the others:

-   **Defeat enemies.** Slaying rotters is the go-to way of obtaining more Flowsion. Every enemy drops Emerald Flowsion on death, but the amount depends on their difficulty level, with bosses dropping way more than common ragdolls.
-   **Touching the spotty mushrooms**. Don't worry, it's quite safe; touch the spotted shroom-like blobs on the floors and walls, and you'll receive some Emerald Flowsion.
-   **Selling items**. Visit Shiroyabu's store (the computer in the library) to sell consumables such as katsu curry, lassi, and medicine. If you make a curry you don't plan to use, be sure to sell it instead of discarding it.
-   **Completing trials**. Find the Trial Room aboard the Last Night and challenge any previously defeated boss for a chance to win Emerald Flowsion (more on this below).

Here's what the shop and trial room look like, respectively:

## The best way to farm Emerald Flowsion in Romeo Is a Dead Man

There are two ways to farm Emerald Flowsion fast in _Romeo Is a Dead Man_. First, and you can do this at the start of the game, is by finding a **Space-Time Pharmacy** (green, shiny teleport waypoint) near a group of enemies. You can defeat the enemies, collect their Emerald Flowsion, and use the Pharmacy to respawn them. Repeat this process to stack up on Flowsion quickly.

To gather even more Emerald Flowsion, consume a **Katsu Stargazer curry**; it can increase your Emerald Flowsion yield by 20%-40% for 10-30 seconds, depending on its quality.

Another way to farm Emerald Flowsion, is to **complete boss trials** in the Trial Room aboard the Last Night. Opposite the bedroom, speak with SilverSox to challenge any boss you've previously defeated. Beware that you must place an Emerald Flowsion deposit, and whether you win or lose Flowsion depends on the outcome of the trial:

-   **Defeat the boss within the time limit**: You win Emerald Flowsion according to the exchange rate and your input. For example, if you deposit 2500 Flowsion and the prize money is your input x 1.2, your reward is 3000 Flowsion (so you win 500).
-   **Defeat the boss exceeding the time limit**: You recover your deposit, but don't win any extra Flowsion.
-   **The boss beats you**: You lose the deposit.

In other words, trials are a risky way to obtain more Emerald Flowsion. The most reliable Flowsion farming method is therefore the first one: Defeating and respawning enemies.

## How to (not) spend Emerald Flowsion in Romeo Is a Dead Man

As _Romeo Is a Dead Man_'s main currency, there are numerous ways to spend your Emerald Flowsion. Here's an overview:

-   **Upgrade character stats**. Use the minigame DeadGear Cannon Ball in the training room aboard the Last Night to pick your stats. The higher the amount of Emerald Flowsion you've got, the more upgrades you can pick.
-   **Unlock new weapons**. Go to the DeadBall Unlocker machine in the training room, where you can buy new weapons for 200 Emerald Flowsion a piece.
-   **Buy items at Shiroyabu's store**, which is situated between the bedroom and training room aboard the Last Night. Items for sale include cooking ingredients, consumables (only medicine and lassi, no katsu curries), Sentrey, Bastard seeds, and badges.
-   **Purchase more Bastard garden plots**. This allows you to plant more Bastards at the same time and thus cultivate them more quickly.
-   **Accelerate Bastard growth speed**. Instead of waiting 10 minutes, you can harvest your new Bastard straight away.

Beware that some Flowsion uses are more important than others. For example, it would be a huge **waste of Emerald Flowsion** to purchase additional Bastard plots at the start of the game, when you've hardly any Bastard seeds to plant. It's also quite unnecessary to speed up the cultivation since you'll often be away on missions for more than 10 minutes at a time, thus giving the Bastards ample time to mature before you return to the ship.

The **best way to spend your Emerald Flowsion** in _Romeo Is a Dead Man_, at least initially, is by unlocking the weapons you want (preferably not all at the same time) and spending the rest on the DeadGear Cannon Ball stat upgrades, which you'll find here, in the training room:

**Buying items** at Shirobayu's can be useful as well, but it depends on the item. Cooking ingredients aren't that important (just cook the dishes you _can_ make from space debris yields), but Badges offer unique passive buffs, so they're quite important. Once you've enough Flowsion to (nearly) maximize your character stats, the next best thing to spend them on is extra Sentrey and Bastard seeds in Shirobayu's shop.
