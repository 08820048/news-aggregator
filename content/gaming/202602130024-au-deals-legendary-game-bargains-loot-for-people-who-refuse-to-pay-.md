Good deals are like rare loot drops. You do not force them. You wait for them. You don't panic buy at full price like an NPC with no self control. You stay patient. You watch the market like it is an unfolding boss fight moveset. Because when the right deal finally hits, there's extra satisfaction to be had with that discount.

## **This Day in Gaming 🎂**

In _Underrated Series That Shouldn’t Have Gone the Way of Dubstep_ news, I’m using a Fire Doomstrike to light 22-candle cake baked for **Maximo vs. Army of Zin**. Technically a sequel that lacks a ‘2’ in its title, this hack ‘n’ slash 3D platformer was just good old-fashioned **Ghosts ‘n Goblins**esque fun. What didn’t change but I adored: taking damage would make Maximo drop trou into his hearts-aplenty boxers. What was introduced and appreciated: the power fantasy of becoming your companion, Grim (as in “Reaper”). Great game. Remaster, please.

When you're got Maximo strength: 1 "weak" hit = decapitation.

-   [Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (NS2)](https://www.amazon.com.au/Metroid-Prime-4-Beyond-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/dp/B0FR3M5NJF?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-37%) - A$69 - Methodical first person exploration that trusts you to read the room. Combat is sharp, pacing deliberate, map occasionally cheeky. Discount makes the commitment easier to swallow.
-   [Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope](https://www.amazon.com.au/Mario-plus-Rabbids-Sparks-of-Hope/dp/B0B5LSVNKP?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-41%) - A$47.50 - Tactical chaos disguised as a kids game. Smart positioning, flashy abilities, Rabbids somehow tolerable. Difficulty spikes late, value right now is excellent.
-   [Assassin's Creed Shadows](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B0FXJJTPTB?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-55%) - A$64.90 - Feudal Japan finally gets the stealth focus it deserves. Open world still padded, stealth tools feel slick. Big cut helps forgive the checklist creep.
-   [Red Dead Redemption](https://www.amazon.com.au/Red-Dead-Redemption-CIB-Switch/dp/B0FMD74GMR?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-64%) - A$25 - Slow draw gunfights and tragic cowboy energy. Mission structure shows its age, writing still elite. Twenty five bucks for a classic is hard to argue with.
-   [Hyper Light Drifter - Special Edition](https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000011161) (-75%) - A$7.50 - Moody pixel art and combat that punishes sloppy thumbs. Story is cryptic on purpose. At under ten dollars, worth the bruised ego.

Or gift a [**Nintendo eShop Card**](https://zdcs.link/V0MbJ?object_uuid=0d1e2321-2d3e-4937-b5e6-c392bb6ba558&t=article).

## Exciting Bargains for Xbox

[

-   [Sonic Frontiers](https://www.amazon.com.au/Sonic-Frontiers/dp/B0BBRZMFDD?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-66%) - A$33.70 - Open zone Sonic is awkward and ambitious in equal measure. Speed feels brilliant, side tasks repetitive. Sale price fits its experimental energy.
-   [Metaphor: ReFantazio](https://www.amazon.com.au/Metaphor-ReFantazio/dp/B0D2HDRT2S?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-48%) - A$60 - Stylish turn based systems with political bite. Long, layered, occasionally overwhelming. Easier to recommend once the price drops under triple digits.
-   [Wild Hearts](https://www.amazon.com.au/WILD-HEARTS/dp/B0BP7J1Y5J?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-79%) - A$23.20 - Monster hunting with build it yourself contraptions. Performance quirks linger, creature design rules. At this price, it is a low risk experiment.
-   [Hogwarts Legacy](https://www.amazon.com.au/Hogwarts-Legacy/dp/B0B9YTYMC9?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-60%) - A$43.90 - Castle exploration is the real magic trick. Open world padding creeps in, combat stays flashy. Discount makes the broom ride smoother.
-   [Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/p/monster-hunter-stories-2-wings-of-ruin/9N4TKJQRLBKS/0010) (-50%) - A$29.90 - Turn based spin off that actually earns its name. Charming monsters, gentler difficulty curve. Half price sweetens the lengthy campaign.

**Xbox One**

-   [Mass Effect Legendary Edition](https://www.amazon.com.au/Mass-Effect-Legendary-Edition/dp/B08PLH2349?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-70%) - A$30.30 - Three sci fi epics cleaned up and bundled neatly. Some jank remains, characters still carry it. Thirty bucks for this much space drama is absurd.
-   [DOOM Eternal](https://www.amazon.com.au/DOOM-Eternal/dp/B07DNTVWKH?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-34%) - A$36.10 - Aggressive combat puzzle disguised as a shooter. Demands weapon swapping discipline, punishes panic. Still one of the tightest loops around.
-   [Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition](https://www.amazon.com.au/Neverwinter-Nights-Enhanced-Edition/dp/B07TRNVWQP?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-51%) - A$36.70 - Deep role playing with menus that feel older than some players. Huge campaigns, patience required. Good value if you like your stats crunchy.

Or just invest in an [**Xbox Card**](https://zdcs.link/glwRb?object_uuid=0d1e2321-2d3e-4937-b5e6-c392bb6ba558&t=article).
