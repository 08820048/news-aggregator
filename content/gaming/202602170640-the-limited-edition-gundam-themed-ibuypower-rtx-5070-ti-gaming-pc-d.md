### iBuypower Y70 Touch Infinite Gundam Limited Edition AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D GeForce RTX 5070 Ti Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)

This iBuypower gaming PC is most definitely a head-turner. The system is enclosed in a custom designed and officially licensed Gundam-themed Hyte Y70 chassis with a built-in 14" 1100x3840 touchscreen display. Specifically, the livery pays homage to the Wing Gundam Zero piloted by Heero Yuy in the Mobile Suit Gundam Wing TV series that aired back in the '90s. Hyte, which is iBuypower's sister site for PC accessories, currently sells the [case for $499.99](https://zdcs.link/z64Yxd?object_uuid=a0420978-257b-4dc3-871a-1562b46559e9&t=article).

Internally, the configuration is equipped with an AMD Ryzen 9 9800X3D CPU, GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GPU, 32GB of DDR5-6000MHz RAM, and a 2TB SSD. The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is one of the fastest gaming CPUs on the market, thanks to the 3D-V-Cache technology that's only found in AMD's X3D lineup. [On Passmark](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/top-gaming-cpus.html), the 9800X3D has the second highest gaming score, trailing a mere 300 points behind the considerably pricier 9900X3D.

The RTX 5070 Ti offers the best bang for your buck amongst the new Nvidia Blackwell cards in terms of 4K gaming performance. It performs neck-and-neck with the previous generation RTX 4080 Super and pulls ahead in any game that supports multi-frame generation, especially with the [recent DLSS 4.5 update](https://in.ign.com/tech/251831/feature/nvidia-here-is-why-i-chose-team-green-and-how-dlss-45-and-its-2nd-gen-transformer-model-changed-my-g). Since the RTX 5070 Ti GPU is non-existent as a standalone card, the only way to get one without paying a ridiculous markup is by getting a prebuilt computer.
