Where to find every fruit, animal trough, and harvestable material

The island in [_Heartopia_](https://www.polygon.com/heartopia/) has a lot to explore. In order to craft new items and cook up new foods, you'll need to harvest fruits and materials. The game will often ask you to turn in fruit and materials as part of your daily quests, so you'll want to make sure you keep your inventory stocked up on these items so you can quickly do your dailies.

The mandarin and apple trees, alongside the raspberry and blueberry bushes, are great places to make money early, as you can turn these into fruit jams for pure profit. The various types of mushrooms (shiitake, button, black truffle, oyster, and penny bun) are also great for stir frying or [cooking](https://www.polygon.com/heartopia-guide-cooking-recipes-list-ingredients-unlock/) into pies and other recipes to make some quick gold. If you're looking to craft up a ton of furniture, you'll want to harvest ore, rocks, and lumber from veins and trees, too.

You'll also want to befriend the animals by leaving them food at their respective [troughs](https://www.polygon.com/heartopia-guide-animal-trough-locations-favorite-foods-list/) to unlock rewards and new interactions with these cute critters. While this won't explicitly make money, it's worth filling up the troughs around the map each day.

Our _Heartopia_ interactive map marks every harvestable **fruit**, vein to harvest **ore** and **rocks**, tree to grab **lumber** from, **mushroom** location, and **animal trough** in the game.
