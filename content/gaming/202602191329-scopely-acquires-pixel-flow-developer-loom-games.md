Scopely has acquired an undisclosed majority stake in Loom Games, the developer of mobile title Pixel Flow.

The Istanbul-based mobile studio was founded last year by CEO Kübra Gündoğan and CTO Emre Çelik.

Shortly after, it launched its hybrid casual puzzle game Pixel Flow, which has surpassed ten million players worldwide.

Gündoğan said that Loom Games' partnership with Scopely will enable the developer to "maintain our creative autonomy while also learning from each other."

Loom Games' team consists of around 20 employees. It closed a seed funding round last year with investors including Arcadia Gaming Partners and e2vc.

"In our conversations with Scopely, their confidence in our hybrid-casual game-making was incredibly affirming," said Gündoğan. "We are proud to be one of few gaming companies in Türkiye to achieve such an impressive outcome with this deal – a milestone that reflects not only our team's dedication, but also the strength and global potential of the Turkish gaming ecosystem."

"We're excited about what we can accomplish with Scopely; this partnership marks the beginning of a new chapter for everything we aspire to create."

Scopely chief revenue officer and board member Tim O'Brien added: "Pixel Flow is only a few months into its journey, yet it's already reached millions of players and climbed the top-grossing charts at remarkable speed."

"The combination of creativity, willingness to iterate, and immediate traction in the mobile game space is extremely rare and impressive, and we believe this team has a bright future ahead."

O'Brien continued: "We are constantly exploring opportunities that could bring more world-class teams and game franchises into our operating system, and this investment signals our ongoing commitment to being a leading partner in the space. We look forward to welcoming the Pixel Flow team into the Scopely ecosystem and supporting their exciting roadmap ahead."
