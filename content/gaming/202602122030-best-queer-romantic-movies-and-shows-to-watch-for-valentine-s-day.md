Romantic movies tend to get all the hype for Valentine's Day, but us staff at IGN wanted to expand the genre into specifically LGBTQIA+ stories on screen to celebrate. So we pulled our favorite queer romantic movies and shows together to share with all of you. You'll see suggestions from people across all departments at IGN, and we love being able to include anyone and everyone who wants to contribute.

Valentine's Day doesn't have to be just about celebrating love in a romantic relationship – whether you are looking for a movie to watch or a show to binge by yourself (with loads of snacks), wanting to cuddle up with a significant other, or planning on hanging out with some friends near or far – there are plenty of options across all genres on this list. We hope you enjoy, and if we missed any, please let us know your favorites in the comments!

## Best Queer Romantic Movies and Shows to Watch

### Portrait of a Lady on Fire

An absolutely essential watch for all of us who swoon at the idea of wearing a billowing skirt and gazing longingly off a cliff into the distant sea while the wind whips through our hair. Portrait of a Lady on Fire is a beautiful story about an 18th century woman who's about to be married against her will, but must first sit for a portrait. A lady painter is hired to do the job, and all the other people in the house go off for a few days, and what ensues is truly lovely. It is, appropriate to the period, unfortunately a bittersweet story that will have you bawling by the end. Grab your best handkerchief for this one.

### Black Lightning

First off, this show is SO GOOD. I'm picky about superhero series, and this one is action-packed, sweet, and raw with real-life issues brought to light. One of the main characters, Anissa Pearce, is actually the first black lesbian superhero ever. As you watch the first season, you'll see Anissa's somewhat messy, committment-issue driven dating life. But if you stick around, you'll get to see Anissa's love story unfold as she meets someone truly special, breaking down walls (literally and figuratively) and honestly loving for the first time; all while having the complexities of, well, superpowers.

### Heated Rivalry

I don’t think I can honestly describe in words how much of a masterpiece Jacob Tierney's Heated Rivalry is, as well as its source material/book counterpart in the Game Changers series by Rachel Reid. Following two rival rookies in the professional hockey world as they battle with themselves (and outside influence) while falling for one another – Shane Hollander (played by Hudson Williams) and Ilya Rozanov (played by Connor Storrie) are extremely opposite characters and bring so much to the screen as they develop emotionally throughout each episode. The slow-burn yearning in the story, matched up with the beautiful chemistry Williams and Storrie naturally have as real life best friends, have created this incredible series that has shattered records across the world.

### Yuri!!! on Ice

Yuri!!! on Ice walked so Heated Rivalry could run. Okay, kind of – you won’t find any scenes quite steamy enough to melt the ice here, but this competitive figure-skating anime is softly romantic in the best, most heartwarming ways. Its first and only season tells the (mostly) contained story of two Yuri’s – one Japanese and one Russian – and their attractive skating-idol five time world championship coach, Viktor, competing in a Grand Prix of Figure Skating. Yuri!!! on Ice is exciting and fun for both fans of the sport and complete unawares, driven by its excellent storytelling that relies on character and relationship development that extends well beyond the main characters. The memorable music and choreography is just icing on the cake.

### A League of Their Own (2022)

With Penny Marshall and Geena Davis' blessing, the 2022 adaptation of the iconic 1992 film expanded upon topics of race and sexuality, weaving a rich tapestry of queer stories set in the not-so-accepting period of WWII. Despite a short run of only 8 episodes, the performances and chemistry from a talented ensemble cast will have you immediately invested in their struggles and triumphs.

### The Birdcage

A comedy where the premise of hiding who you are to others made the queer community even more seen. The iconic Robin Williams and Nathan Lane play partners who would do anything for their son, and in doing so come to understand one another even more. And if that sounds too serious, you haven't seen the pure comedy of Lane, a diva actor who can bring down the club but cannot learn to play a straight man for the life of him.

### Arcane

I could wax poetic about the incredibly impressive amount of detail in the animation or how it's one of the most successful video game adaptations of all time, but what I really watched Arcane for was the relationship between Caitlyn and Vi. Amongst navigating impossible circumstances, intense traumas, and the constant battle between heart and duty, Cait and Vi are two magnets that resist and repel each other no matter how much you try to press the like poles together, until all it takes is the slightest shift for them to come crashing together in the undeniable natural laws of opposite attraction. You can't help but be drawn into their story as well.

### Looking

I first watched Looking during its premiere and struggled with each of the main character’s choices so much so that I vowed to never watch again. After pushing play last year in 2025 my perspective shifted. Looking is a fun lens on an arch type that dominates gay cisgender culture. When you take it for what it is, a focus on characters that are such a small part of queer life, you might enjoy this binge-friendly show and movie.

### Ammonite

This is a really gorgeous film that's VERY loosely based on a real-life story of a British palaeontologist who falls for a geologist she's supposed to help convalesce by the seaside. The two bond over a mutual love of fossils and a feeling of separation from the rest of society, and, well, things get a little steamy! It doesn't really have a happy ending, so fair warning, but it's such a beautiful ride. Just two girls diggin' up beach dinosaurs!

### Carol

Carol is one of the most beautiful films I’ve ever seen, from the story itself to the phenomenal acting to the gorgeous and intentional cinematography. The story follows the lives of Carol (Cate Blanchett) and Therese (Rooney Mara) as they learn about themselves on a deeper level while overcoming challenges of being attracted to one another in the 1950’s. The film has moments that squeeze your heart in the worst ways, but also make you want to burst with joy at other times. Being filmed with Super 16mm to get a grainy and Ektachrome style, really makes you feel as if you were pulled into that time period and into the love story blossoming before your eyes. I highly recommend everyone watch this to see a new perspective on what it was like to be a queer woman in 1950’s America.

### Weekend

Looking for an anti-Valentine’s moving centered around typical yearning that we should all heal from? Check out Andrew Haigh’s Weekend. While I admit it has been a minute since I have watched this, its vulnerability and honesty makes this one worth a watch.

### Sex Education

Sex Education is one of those shows that I desperately wish I had when I was a teenager. Not only are the characters amusing and relatable, but you feel like you’re part of their friend groups and going on this journey with them throughout the show (not to mention the gorgeous landscapes you get to see in the UK). The topics covered touch all the curiosity teens (and adults!) generally have. Whether it’s a sexual, romantic, or just a human emotional experience, it makes you feel less alone in your own life. Sex Education follows characters throughout multiple queer storylines and it’s beyond refreshing to see this created in such a genuine way. Also, Gillian Anderson as a sex therapist? Yes, please!

### The Duke of Burgundy

This is a visually stunning erotic film that explores the relationship between two women in the field of Lepidopterology. Initially, it seems to be an incredibly controlled, and at times, exploitative power dynamic between the two, but there's a hidden tenderness that comes to light and shows the deep commitment and sacrifices that are made in a long-term relationship. There's a voyeuristic element to it with lots of slow, zooming shots, but it's intensely intimate without being sleazy. I can't stress enough how beautiful the shots are with muted, autumnal colours, close-ups of butterflies and moths. Plus, it's got a beautiful soundtrack by Cat's Eyes.

### Black Mirror, Episode "Hotel Reverie"

I loved this episode so much. Issa Rae, Emma Corrin, Awkwafina – chef's kiss. A beautiful story of an unlikely pair: a closeted actress from the past and an actress from the present looking to find a role she's passionate about, leading her to take on a high-tech immersive remake of an old British film.

### Stranger by the Lake

French erotic thriller Stranger by the Lake is another great anti-Valentine’s pick. The film’s sun-soaked, beach-day pace might be too slow for a group viewing, but is perfect for a more intimate setting. Definitely check this one out if you aren't intimidated by the subtitles.

### Warrior Nun

Another victim of early cancellation, Warrior Nun never got to fully flesh out the romance between the spunky lead character and an actual nun. What we do have is two seasons of YEARNING all set amongst a fantastical supernatural drama full of heart and humor, with a diverse cast and the beautiful backdrops of Spain. If that's not enough to convince you to watch, nuns with guns (and swords, and knives, and a CROSSBOW).

### The Christmas Baby

Both no stranger to queer roles, Ali Liebert in her second Hallmark feature and Kat Barrell of Wynonna Earp fame play a married couple in this new heartwarming holiday film. Amongst the relatively cookie-cutter Hallmark catalog, this one stands out not just as a queer romance, but for featuring them as the network's first established lesbian couple instead of another "meet-and-fall-in-love" narrative.
