Peacock was the sole streaming service for the 2026 Winter Olympics and the [Super Bowl](https://www.ign.com/tv/super-bowl) last month, but March doesn't have nearly that same level of live coverage on the service. If you're wondering what new content a [Peacock Premium subscription](https://www.ign.com/wikis/peacock/Plans_and_Pricing) _will_ get you access to this month, we've got you covered with the full list of movies and TV shows coming down the pipeline.

The biggest highlight for March is the streaming premiere of [Wicked: For Good](https://www.ign.com/movies/wicked-for-good), which arrives alongside a couple Wizard of Oz related movies (The Wiz, It's Dorothy!). Ted season 2 is also set to premiere this month, which is the only new Peacock Original on the list. You'll also be able to [stream a couple of Friday the 13th movies](https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-stream-friday-the-13th-movies) starting on March 1, which is only really notable because those films have only been available to rent or buy for quite some time.

### See All Bundle Plans

Apple TV and Peacock Premium for $14.99/month, or Apple TV and Peacock Premium Plus for $19.99/month

If you don't already have a Peacock Premium subscription, there are a few different options available to you. For savings, I'd recommend sticking with one of the [Apple TV and Peacock Premium bundles](https://www.ign.com/wikis/apple-tv/Plans_and_Pricing#Apple_TV_Bundles). This will get you both services at a decent discount, which opens up the full library of Apple TV Originals. You can also get access to Peacock via a Walmart+ subscription, which is a great option for those looking for additional savings via shopping benefits.

Although [Peacock does not have a free trial](https://www.ign.com/wikis/peacock/Free_Trial) available, you can get access to the service for [free via a Walmart+ trial](https://www.ign.com/wikis/walmart-plus/Free_Trial). Walmart offers 30 days of its service at no cost for new subscribers and includes either a Peacock Premium or Paramount+ subscription.
