At least 1,200 Ubisoft staff have gone on strike this week, as part of a planned protest over the Assassin's Creed maker's recent cost-cutting, studio closures and enforced return-to-work policy.

Hundreds of employees gathered with banners and flags outside Ubisoft's Paris headquarters — [which itself will be the subject of staff cuts, with 200 jobs at risk](https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-follows-last-weeks-game-cancelations-and-studio-closures-with-a-proposed-reduction-of-200-more-jobs-at-its-paris-headquarters). Staff have called for the impending return-to-work mandate to be changed, and to show their general displeasure at the constant bleed of staff and projects.

The numbers of staff on strike were shared with [GamesIndustry.biz](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/at-least-1200-ubisoft-workers-strike-in-response-to-recent-restructuring) by the Solidaires Informatique union, which also confirmed a small number of employees had gone on strike in Italy, at Ubisoft Milan.

One attendee held up a sign stating: "From offices to courts, no respite for the Guillemots," referencing Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot, and presumably the members of his family also employed within the company. Another, who wore a Rabbids mask to obscure their face, shared a sign that read: "There is money in the coffers of the employers!"

In Milan, employees held up signs including "Shareholders cannot make games" and "Don't play with our lives." An [impromptu disco session also broke out](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:4q3meuwdkjq5xv6kdwwkoykc/post/3meir3b46hs2m), with striking staff dancing to chiptunes while waving banners.

"At this stage, it seems clear to us that Yves Guillemot has no knowledge or understanding of his company or its employees," Solidaires Informatique union representative Marc Rutschlé said. "The company is continuing its cost reduction and layoff plan. Our teams are already working under pressure, often understaffed. After several years without pay rises (or very small increases), we understand that once again, employees will not receive a raise this year."

Ubisoft's Parisian offices have previously been the sight of protests against the company's previous return-to-office stipulations. Last month, Ubisoft said its company reorganization would now reintroduce five-day office work as standard (albeit with an annual pool of remote working days).

The year began with Ubisoft [announcing the cancelation of six games, the closure of two studios and further job losses at another three locations](https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-6-projects-including-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-closes-2-studios-and-confirms-further-layoffs-in-major-company-restructure) as part of its sweeping company reshuffle. Of the half dozen games that have now been fully scrapped, Ubisoft only publicly named one — its long-awaited [Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake](https://www.ign.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake).

The firm also confirmed it had delayed a further seven games, including an unannounced title set for launch within the next two months that is [widely expected to be the company's under-wraps Assassin's Creed: Black Flag remaster](https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-is-the-name-of-ubisofts-long-awaited-pirate-remake).
