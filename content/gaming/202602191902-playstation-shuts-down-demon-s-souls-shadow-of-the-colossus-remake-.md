PlayStation has shut down Bluepoint Games, the studio behind the remakes of both Shadow of the Colossus and Demon's Souls.

This [comes from Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-19/sony-is-shutting-down-the-playstation-studio-bluepoint), which confirmed the news with PlayStation. Roughly 70 employees are going to be impacted by the closure when it officially occurs next month.

“Bluepoint Games is an incredibly talented team and their technical expertise has delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community,” a PlayStation spokesperson told Bloomberg. “We thank them for their passion, creativity and craftmanship."

According to a [previous report by Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects), Bluepoint was working on a live-service God of War game up until January of 2025, when the projet was canceled. The studio then spent last year pitching new projects, but ultimately was shuttered before it could get one moving.

Bluepoint was founded in 2006 by former Retro Studios employees, and proceeded to work on a number of PlayStation games, including several collections of existing games such as the God of War Collection, Metal Gear Solid HD Collection, and Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection. It also served as a support studio on ports of games like PlayStation All-Stars, Flower, and Titanfall.

But Bluepoint's claim to fame was its 2018 remake of [Shadow of the Colossus](https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/30/shadow-of-the-colossus-for-ps4-review), followed by its 2020 [remake of Demon's Souls](https://www.ign.com/articles/demons-souls-review-2), both of which were highly praised by critics and fans. It wasn't until after Demon's Souls that Sony acquired Bluepoint in 2021. Under Sony's management, Bluepoint did some co-development work on God of War Ragnarok, but otherwise did not release or announce any new games.
