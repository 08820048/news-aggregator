### Monster Hunter Wilds (PS5)

It's easy to see why [Monster Hunter](https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-games-in-order) is one of Capcom's best selling IPs. Monster Hunter Wilds is the latest game in the franchise and continues the series' trademark action-adventure gameplay of hunting down fearsome monsters and grinding for better loot. This open-world game offers dozens of hours of exploration, exciting combat, excellent creature design, statisfying loot progression, and most importantly, cats!

According to [How Long To Beat](https://howlongtobeat.com/game/141854), the main story takes 17 hours, with another 13 hours to tackle all of the sidequests. Completionists should expect to spend a whopping 90 hours to reach 100% and attain that Platinum Trophy. At just $20, it's absolutely worth adding to your collection.
