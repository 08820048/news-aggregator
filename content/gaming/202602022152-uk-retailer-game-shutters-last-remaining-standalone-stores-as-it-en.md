UK high street retailer GAME is closing its three remaining standalone stores as managing director, Nick Arran, exits the company after nine years.

As reported by [The Game Business](https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/what-has-happened-to-game-the-game), via [VGC](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/uk-retailer-game-is-closing-its-remaining-standalone-stores-after-entering-administration/), the Frasers Group-owned business will continue to operate its 200+ concession sites across Sports Direct and House of Fraser stores, as well as its retail website.

[GAME filed a notice of its intention to bring in insolvency administrators last week](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-uk-retailer-game-is-going-into-administration-again), following weak sales over the Christmas period last year.

[GAME was acquired in 2019 by Mike Ashley's Fraser Group – then Sport Direct – for £51.9 million](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sports-direct-makes-51-9m-offer-for-game). That followed [the retail billionaire snapping up a 25.75% stake in the chain two years prior](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sports-direct-buys-large-stake-in-struggling-game), then slowly increasing his ownership of the company over time.

At the start of 2024, however, [the company decided to exit the pre-owned business](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/uk-chain-game-to-exit-pre-owned-business), while later that year, [the retailer dropped its Xbox All Access and reward scheme](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/game-drops-xbox-all-access-and-reward-scheme). In July 2024, [GAME stopped offering in-store pre-orders](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/game-reportedly-dropping-in-store-pre-orders-next-month), too. In April, [the company made redundancies as the majority of workers were moved to zero-hour contracts](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-game-braced-for-redundancies), and in August, [the majority of staff at GAME's head office were let go](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/majority-of-game-head-office-staff-reportedly-laid-off-since-august).

In 2025, [the retailer said that it had been forced to cancel "some" pre-orders for the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/uk-retailer-game-forced-to-cancel-some-nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders).

Speaking with _GamesIndustry.biz_ in 2023, then-MD Arran [denied claims the chain was turning its back on its games business](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/game-we-will-be-the-last-man-standing-in-physical-video-games) to focus on other items, such as toys, insisting: "Gaming is our core business and we will be last man standing selling physical video games.

"We see our place in the market as proving that there is a place for physical, whether that be the collector's editions, which we see as the vinyl of video games, or the gifter who doesn't want to wrap up a download code for Christmas. But we need to be realistic. We have a business to run and the expectation is this will decline. So we need to fill that gap."
