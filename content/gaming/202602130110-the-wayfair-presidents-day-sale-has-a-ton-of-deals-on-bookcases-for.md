It's always easier to build a collection than it is to actually find a place to put it. If you find yourself with a growing library of video games, books, or movies without enough space to fit them, you're probably in need of a decent bookcase. The right bookcase can turn an unorganized mess of items into a perfectly curated library that makes you look like the sophisticated collector you are.

If you're in the market for a new bookcase, right now is actually a great time to find a good deal on one. The Wayfair Presidents Day sale is live ahead of the weekend and features literally thousands of discounts on bookcases.

## The Wayfair Bookcase Sale Is Live Ahead of the Weekend

### Wayfair Presidents Day Sale

See all deals on bookcases.

There are pages and pages of different styles and sizes available, so I recommend just browsing yourself. The Wayfair website lets you sort by brand, price, and category. The [Wayfair app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wayfair.wayfair&hl=en_US) is even better for sorting, though definitely not necessary if you're looking to make a single purchase.

I've bought quite a few home items from Wayfair over the years and have had no issue with quality or delivery speed. The prices during these types of sales tend to be very good, and the sheer number of options available make it really easy to find something you like.

With that in mind, I did take the time to browse this sale myself and pick out some good options. Each of these bookshelves are heavily discounted and feature something unique and interesting. Whether you're looking for a massive case to house hundreds of books, or just something sleek and elegant [for your video game collection](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-video-game-storage-ideas), there's something for everyone here.

## Tips for Choosing a Bookcase for Your Home

I'm certainly no expert on interior design, but my wife is actually an interior designer, so I've learned a few things about choosing furniture that may be helpful to you. While style is, of course, a big consideration, there are a few more logical things you should think about before you buy. Here are some quick tips if you don't know where to start in 2026.

### Figure out where you want to put it

The first and most important thing to consider before buying any type of furniture is where it's going to go. This will help you narrow down the specific dimensions you'll need to look for, as well as what design will practically and aesthetically fit the space. For example, if you are currently living in a tiny apartment, a giant bookcase that will take up half the room probably isn't a smart choice. And if it's going into a room with wood floors, you may want to avoid picking a slightly different color wood shelf that will directly clash. Understanding where you plan on putting a bookshelf can help you visualize what will work best.

### Figure out what you want to display

Once you have a space in mind, the second most important thing to think about is what exactly you'll be putting on those shelves. Are you only going to be using it for your book collection, or will it be primarily for your 4K movie collection? You'll also need to decide if you are planning on adding other knickknacks (like a [book nook](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-book-nook-kits-for-adults)) or if you'll only be using it for media. This may affect the type of shelving heights you're shopping for.

### Check the assembly options

My final tip is to make sure you can actually build the thing yourself before you make your purchase. I spent about a year earlier in my career working at a furniture delivery company and was always surprised by how often people expect things to show up fully assembled. Bookcases tend to be fairly straightforward to put together and will usually come with all of the tools to do so yourself, but it's worth checking the reviews to see how difficult assembly actually is before you buy. Wayfair also offers an option to have someone assemble it for you for an extra fee.
