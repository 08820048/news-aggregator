The [_Mewgenics_](https://www.polygon.com/game/mew-genics/3325/) boss called **Boris** forms a big hurdle to overcome in The Sewers. Despite his size, he's a highly mobile enemy who can move from one end of the arena to the other, thereby crushing every cat in its path. Luckily, you can avoid much of his damage by using the right attack types.

Here's how to defeat Boris in _Mewgenics_.

## How to defeat Boris in Mewgenics

Boris is the final boss in The Sewers, which means you'll first encounter him in Act 1, after you've cleared The Alley. Boris has **200 HP**, so be prepared for a fairly long battle.

Although he doesn't have minions, Boris **automatically moves in the direction of every cat that hits him** and **damages anyone that he comes into contact with**. Luckily, he can only move one tile in their direction, thus making it possible to avoid damage. **Ranged attacks** work best; as long as there's a tile between the attacking cat and Boris, he can't reach them. Melee cats, too, can avoid counterattack damage by using **knockback attacks**; if they push Boris back one tile or more, he won't be able to hit them. In other words, the **hunter and tank** would be the best options among the early game [_Mewgenics_ classes](https://www.polygon.com/mewgenics-classes-collars-how-to-unlock/).

Besides the counterattacks, Boris uses normal **dash attacks** with a range of two tiles and a **trample dash** special attack that activates after his final turn of the round. The trample dash can cross the entire length of the arena, so it's important to spread your units so they don't stand in one line as you don't want Boris to hit them all at once.

In the example below, the Hunter is about to attack the boss, but Boris will never be able to close that distance with either his counterattack or normal dash attack. Since the boss' last turn of the round has already passed, the Hunter doesn't need to fear the trample dash either.

Since you're constantly attacking the same enemy, hitting him with **damage over time effects** like bleed is very helpful. Note that you can easily lure this boss into a trap that inflicts such status effects by placing it between him and a (ranged) unit.

Finally, beware of the water in this _Mewgenics_ boss arena. At the end of every round, the **water moves counterclockwise**, thereby pushing every unit a distance of two tiles in the same direction. Make sure your units aren't pushed into spiky rocks as a result.
