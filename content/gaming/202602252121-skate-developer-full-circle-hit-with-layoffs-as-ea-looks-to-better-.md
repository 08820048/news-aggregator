[Skate](https://www.ign.com/games/skate) developer Full Circle has announced layoffs affecting an undisclosed number of staff as it aims to “better support” the “long-term future” of its free-to-play title.

Publisher EA revealed its “reshaping” plans with [a blog post](https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/full-circle/news/an-update-from-fullcircle?utm_campaign=skt_hd_ww_ic_ic_twt_fc-update-from-full-circle&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&cid=88627&ts=1772050332079) on the studio’s website. No detailed information about the number of affected employees or their roles was given, with the message only stating that “making changes to our team structure” means that “some roles will be impacted.”

“The teammates affected are talented colleagues and friends who helped build the foundation of skate.,” Full Circle said. “Their creativity and dedication are deeply ingrained in what players experience today. This decision is not a reflection of their impact and we’re committed to supporting them through this transition.”

The post mentions that tens of millions of players have played the free-to-play Skate reboot since it launched as an Early Access title for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X | S September 2025. Today’s restructuring is said “to better support skate.’s long-term future and focus the team on the things that matter most to you.” EA and Full Circle sign off by assuring fans they will work with the community as they “move faster, listen more closely, and deliver consistently” as development on Skate continues.

This decision is not a reflection of their impact and we’re committed to supporting them through this transition.“

“To our departing teammates: thank you. skate. exists because of your hard work and dedication to the craft.”

Full Circle’s restructuring is only the latest in a string of layoffs and game cancellations at EA. Following [layoffs impacting around 670 workers](https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-to-lay-off-around-670-to-advance-the-way-we-work) in early 2024, the Battlefield and Madden publisher [cut 300 additional jobs across the company](https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cuts-around-300-roles-including-roughly-100-at-respawn) in April 2025. That move alone saw [the cancellation of a new project set in the Titanfall universe](https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-dev-respawn-cancels-another-incubation-project-around-100-employees-impacted) at Respawn Entertainment, as the studio accounted for around 100 of the affected roles at the time.

EA went on to [end remote hiring and push employees to return to the office](https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-pushes-full-return-to-office-effectively-ends-remote-hiring) the following month. The [closure of Cliffhanger Games](https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-games), the studio behind the [now-cancelled Black Panther video game](https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-developers-wave-goodbye-to-ambitious-and-special-black-panther-game-it-breaks-my-heart-the-world-wont-see-it), then arrived just weeks later. September 2025 then saw the company announce it had accepted [a $55 billion acquisition offer](https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-with-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-andrew-wilson-to-remain-as-ceo) from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners, and Silver Lake.

Full Circle will continue development on Skate as it works to secure its long-term future. As detailed in [a separate post last week](https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/seasonal-roadmap-update), the free-to-play skating revival will soon launch into Season 3. The rest of its roadmap includes the promise of additional features, cosmetics, game modes, and more.

IGN reached out to EA for comment regarding the restructuring at Full Circle, but was pointed back to the note shared by the studio in lieu of further comment.
