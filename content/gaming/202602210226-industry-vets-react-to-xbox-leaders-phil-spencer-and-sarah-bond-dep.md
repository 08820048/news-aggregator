In an exclusive story, [we reported that Xbox boss and Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer](https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-retiring-sarah-bond-out-matt-booty-promoted-as-microsoft-ai-exec-asha-sharma-named-new-xbox-boss-exclusive) is retiring and Xbox president Sarah Bond is leaving her position. Consequently, president of Microsoft's CoreAI product Asha Sharma is taking over as CEO of Xbox with Matt Booty moving up to executive vice president and CCO of Xbox. This shake-up in Xbox leadership was a surprise to many and sent waves across the gaming industry from former Xbox execs to industry veterans alike. We compiled some of the statements made online coming out of the news from key individuals, including what Sarah Bond's had to say upon leaving the Xbox brand.

[Bond went to LinkedIn to give her statement](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sarahrbond_sharing-with-gratitude-the-note-i-sent-to-activity-7430753683912531968-YEXj?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABCCrCcBSX0W5PCP6CWfBirXddT2ISbjULs) on her departure and the leadership changes at Xbox, sharing the note she sent to colleagues internally:

> _Sharing with gratitude the note I sent to my team today. Grateful to our players, developers, partners, and team. Forever a fan of Xbox. 💚  
> \-----  
> Hi team,_

> _I know there’s a lot of news to take in today._

> _I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built together over the past eight-plus years. PC and cloud gaming are growing faster than ever, our next console is well underway, and together we’ve helped lay the foundation for a more open gaming platform that spans devices and reaches players around the world._

> _When we announced our intention to acquire Activision Blizzard in 2022, I committed to helping lead Xbox through what would be a critical period of change. Over the past four years, we’ve navigated that moment together and positioned the business for what comes next. We took on some of the biggest challenges this organization has ever faced and did it as one team._

> _With that, I’ve decided this is the right time for me to take my next step, both personally and professionally. We’re living through a transformative technological era that will shape the next generation of our industry, and I’m energized by what’s ahead. This moment also presents a unique opportunity for fresh eyes and new leadership to guide the team into its next chapter. I’ve had the privilege of spending time with Asha over the last few weeks as we’ve planned for this transition, and I’ve seen firsthand her deep commitment to our players, developers, and brand. She brings deep technology and commerce experience, along with a strong track record of building and scaling platforms that the world uses. Xbox deserves this. I’m excited to see her lead this next chapter for our team. I’ll remain on as a Special Advisor to Asha to help ensure a smooth transition and set the organization up for continued success._

> _I want to thank Phil for his mentorship and friendship over the years. He’s been a consistent champion of this business and the people who make it what it is, and I’ve learned a great deal from the way he leads through both opportunity and challenge. I’m grateful for his trust and support throughout my time on the team. I also want to thank Satya for his sponsorship and support throughout my time at Microsoft._

> _As I prepare to sign off, I’ve been reflecting on three simple questions I’ve tried to use to guide my days:_

> _Did I bring my best?  
> Did I help someone else succeed?  
> Did I do my best work?_

> _I hope the answer has been yes for many of you. It’s been a privilege to work alongside this team._

> _Always,  
> Sarah_

[On LinkedIn, Peter Moore](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/peter-moore-36827b233_news-that-phil-spencer-has-stepped-away-marks-activity-7430747913259180032-Bb3a), former VP of entertainment at Microsoft and longtime CEO and EVP at Electronic Arts:

> _News that Phil Spencer has stepped away marks the end of a significant chapter for Microsoft Gaming and in particular Xbox._

> _It is easy, especially in today’s climate, to critique decisions, debate strategy, and judge outcomes with the benefit of hindsight. What is harder is to sustain leadership over decades in an industry that reinvents itself every few years. Of that, I’m only too painfully aware._

> _Phil did that._

> _From the early days of Xbox through console transitions, studio acquisitions, platform wars, and the rise of subscription and cloud, he was a steady presence in what has often been a turbulent environment. Gaming at Microsoft has never been a quiet assignment. Expectations were immense. Competition was relentless. The spotlight was constant._

> _I had the privilege of working alongside him during formative years for the business. What I saw was commitment to players, loyalty to teams, and resilience when the noise was loudest. Phil was,and is, a gamer at heart and that showed in everything he did during my time with him._

> _Leadership in this industry means making imperfect decisions with incomplete information, under extraordinary pressure. It means standing in front when things go wrong, and sharing credit when they go right. That is not easy work._

> _Whatever opinions swirl today (and I see the boo birds are out in flocks) history tends to be kinder and more balanced. Sustained contribution matters. Building institutions matters. Showing up year after year matters._

> _A long career in gaming, particularly at the scale of Microsoft, deserves respect._

> _Wishing Phil good luck for whatever comes next. All the best, mate._

Phil Spencer himself reflected on the 38 years he spent working at Microsoft as well and [we broke down his statement](https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-reflects-on-38-years-at-microsoft-i-never-could-have-imagined-the-path-ahead) in a separate story. He oversaw initiatives such as Xbox Game Pass, the launches of the Xbox One X and the Xbox Series consoles, and several acquisitions of development teams such as Bethesda Game Studios, Playground Games, Ninja Theory, Obsidian Entertainment, and more as well as the industry-shaking $69 billion acquisition of Activision-Blizzard-King.
