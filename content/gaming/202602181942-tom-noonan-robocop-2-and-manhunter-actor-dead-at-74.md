Noonan’s career in Hollywood dates back to the ‘80s, where he played small parts in movies like Willie & Phil and Gloria. He went on to add projects like Wolfen and Easy Money to his resume that same decade, with roles like Francis Dollarhyde in Manhunter, Cain in RoboCop 2, and Kelso in Heat establishing him as one of the more memorable names working in the business at the time. While appearances in everything from Last Action Hero to The Leftovers kept him in front of audiences over the years, his most recent projects included 12 Monkeys, Wonderstruck, and Animals.

Noonan was also involved as a director and writer on things like the Monsters series in the ‘90s and the movie version of his play, The Shape of Something Squashed. Dekker remembers him as the man who played Frankenstein’s Monster in The Monster Squad film.

“In the end, he found the make-up ardous \[sic\] and annoying (he was fond of tearing it off after we wrapped, and one night didn't even bother to take it off; just drove home in his Frankenstein appliance),” the director recalls. “But all in all, he was the proverbial gentleman and scholar, and the world has lost a great talent.

“R.I.P. Tom. Thanks for the great work.”

Fans and former co-workers have both taken to social media to share fond memories and highlights from Noonan’s career. You can see just some of the posts already published online below.

> Tom Noonan dead at the age of 74. A great character actor who could deliver both menace & emotional frailty - often at the same time. His turn as Francis Dollarhyde in Michael Mann's Manhunter is an exceptional performance that adds extra layers to an already great film. [pic.twitter.com/dEHfFZfAqc](https://t.co/dEHfFZfAqc)
