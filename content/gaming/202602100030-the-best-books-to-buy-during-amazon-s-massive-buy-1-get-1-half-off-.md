Amazon is running another ['Buy 2, get 1 50% off' sale](https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-has-a-buy-1-get-1-half-price-sale-on-4k-blu-ray-movies-board-games-february-2026) this week and some of my favorite books are included here. Whether you're hoping to grab a [Valentine's Day gift](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-valentines-day-gift-ideas-for-2026) for someone who loves to read or just looking to stock your own library, right now is a great time to find savings on actual physical books.

If you already know what you're looking for, I'd recommend just [**diving into the full sale yourself**](https://zdcs.link/9yPAwe?object_uuid=a5824f15-7c6a-4900-8dfe-778f90b74331&t=article). There are a ton of books included in the promotion and you can easily type things into the search bar to see if they are eligible for that extra 50% off. Otherwise, you can check out some of my top picks for both reading _and_ gifting.

## Books I Recommend From the Sale

My overall top pick from this sale is Dungeon Crawler Carl, which has consistently been one of my favorite [LitRPG books](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-litrpg-book-series). It's not a series I'd recommend for everyone, but it's fast, fun, and filled with a surprising amount of explosions. The story follows a guy named Carl and his ex-girlfriend's cat as Earth gets taken over by an alien game show and straddled by a completely unhinged AI. There are currently [seven books in there series so far](https://www.ign.com/articles/dungeon-crawler-carl-books-in-order) and the [next book is releasing in May](https://www.ign.com/articles/dungeon-crawler-carl-book-8-is-up-for-preorder).

If sci-fi is more your thing, then I highly recommend checking out Andy Weir's Project Hail Mary. The movie adaptation is coming out in March, so right now is the best time to read it before the movie ruins it for you. Assuming the [trailers for the movie](https://www.ign.com/videos/project-hail-mary-official-final-trailer) haven't already spoiled you on the plot, I'd suggest going in cold and just enjoying the story. It's incredibly well written and you don't need to be a sci-fi nerd to enjoy it. Plus if you like it enough, you can also grab the [new LEGO set collaboration](https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-project-hail-mary-set-where-to-buy) coming out next month.

My last big recommendation on this list comes from my deep love for [Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere universe](https://www.ign.com/articles/brandson-sanderson-cosmere-books-in-order). In case you missed the news, Apple TV and Sanderson recently struck a deal to adapt his sprawling fantasy universe for streaming. If you've never read any of the Cosmere books before, you're going to want to check out the Mistborn trilogy or the Stormlight Archive first. Amazon has [box sets for both included in this sale](https://www.ign.com/articles/brandon-sanderson-books-sale-amazon-february-2026), so it's a perfect starter pack for anyone new to that universe.

## The Best Books to Give as Gifts

For those looking for gift ideas, there are a lot of different options available. My overall favorite [reading gifts](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gift-ideas-for-readers) to recommend, however, are illustrated editions. More specifically, I'd suggest checking out The Lord of the Rings Illustrated edition and the [Harry Potter Illustrated editions](https://www.ign.com/articles/all-harry-potter-illustrated-edition-books). The Lord of the Rings book I've featured here includes drawings and maps from Tolkien himself and is a really fun way to read the [LotR books](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-books-reading-order). Whereas the Harry Potter illustrated books feature gorgeous art from Jim Kay that really capture the magic of the series.

There are also some really cool gift editions of classic stories that I'd suggest checking out. The complete [Sherlock Holmes collection](https://www.ign.com/articles/sherlock-holmes-books-in-order) looks awesome and features all of the novels from Arthur Conan Doyle in one volume. The Winnie-the-Pooh gift edition is also one of my [top Disney gift picks](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-disney-gifts-for-adults) and I'd definitely recommend that. My copy is currently sitting on a shelf in my son's nursery and we've already gotten some good use out of it.

If you're willing to spend a bit more, Amazon also includes quite a few box sets in this sale that are worth a look. Fans of the [Game of Thrones books](https://www.ign.com/articles/game-of-thrones-books-in-order) will love the leather-bound box set of George R.R. Martin's series. There's also the entire hardcover set of Sarah J. Maas' Throne of Glass Series included here that I'd recommend for any fan of the romantasy genre. And the Calvin and Hobbes collection is just a great gift for anyone regardless of their preferences.
