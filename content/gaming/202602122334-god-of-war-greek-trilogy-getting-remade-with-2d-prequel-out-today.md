As revealed during February's PlayStation State of Play stream, the original God of War trilogy is getting a remake. In addition to that, Sony Santa Monica revealed a brand-new 2D game in the series titled _God of War: Son of Sparta_, which is out now.

The God of War series got a major spotlight during State of Play, getting the stream's grand finale slot. First, Sony revealed that the first three God of War games are getting a remake. We didn't actually see footage of those games, mind you. We only got a logo reveal confirming that they are in development, with no release window set. Don't expect those to come out anytime soon, as the project is in its "early stages" of development, according to Sony.

_God of War: Son of Sparta,_ on the other hand, got a surprise reveal and launch today. Developed by Mega Cat Studios, the 2D game is a prequel to the series that tells a story from Kratos' youth. At the close of 2018's _God of War_, Kratos tells a heartfelt story about his Spartan buddy Atreus, who eventually becomes his son's namesake — it's a safe bet this 2D adventure will explore this friendship in greater depth. _Son of Sparta_ features fast-paced 2D combat and narration from TC Carson, Kratos' original voice actor. You can get a standard edition of the game right now for $30, or pay $40 for a digital deluxe edition.

Both projects have been rumored for months now. In fact, rumors of some form of trilogy remaster have been floating around for [two years now](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/18pihjp/shpeshal_nick_original_god_of_war_trilogy_may_be/). Meanwhile, rumors of a 2D God of War game [date back to last March](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/greek-god-of-war-side-story-releasing-this-year-report/1100-6530298/).

The God of War remake trilogy is currently in development. _God of War: Son of Sparta_ is out now on PlayStation 5.
