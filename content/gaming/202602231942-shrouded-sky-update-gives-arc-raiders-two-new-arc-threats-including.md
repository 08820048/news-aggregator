[_Arc Raiders_](https://www.polygon.com/game/arc-raiders/443837/)' latest update, called [Shrouded Sky](https://www.polygon.com/arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-update-release-time-est-pst/), goes live Feb. 24. In addition to a new map condition, a new project, and a new Raider Deck, the update also features two new Arc threats for players to contend with: The Firefly and The Comet.

The aptly named Firefly is effectively a drone with flamethrower capabilities, which developer Embark Studios describes as "a floating nightmare." The Firefly will burn Raiders "to a crisp" if they fail to find cover or other means to escape its jet of flames. The Comet, meanwhile, is a ground-bound sphere that patrols the surface of the Rust Belt, and will lock onto Raiders who venture too close. Once it's locked-on to a target, it will explode, causing serious damage.

A new free Raider Deck has also been introduced: The Surgeon. "The Surgeon cosmetic is gradually unlocked by completing the Raider Deck, but whether you want to be Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde is up to you," reads [Embark's blog post](https://arcraiders.com/news/shrouded-sky-content-update) detailing the new update. "Scrub up, take your oath, and head topside to heal… or wreak havoc."

But new Arc threats and a free Raider Deck aren't all the Shrouded Sky update is bringing to the table. Once Shrouded Sky goes live, players will also gain access to a brand-new feature: facial hair! The Stubble cosmetic will be instantly available to all players once the update has been released, while the Full Beard is an unlockable feature of the Surgeon Raider Deck. Two additional styles — the Stubble Beard and Thick Moustache — will be available to purchase via the in-game store starting Feb. 24.

"Don't worry if it feels weird at first… it grows on you," Embark joked in the Shrouded Sky blog post.

The Shrouded Sky update will also add a new map condition — [the hurricane](https://arcraiders.com/news/surviving-the-hurricane-map-condition) — to the game, along with a new project that sees players working with Shani to collect materials that will allow her to build a better weather-monitoring system. All of these updates will become available tomorrow via the Shrouded Sky update patch in _Arc Raiders_. You can read more details about the patch in [Embark's blog post](https://arcraiders.com/news/shrouded-sky-content-update).
