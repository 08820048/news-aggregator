Here's a great opportunity to pick up a fully featured 3D printer for a supremely low price. AliExpress is currently offering the [Anycubic Kobra 3 V2 3D Printer Combo](https://zdcs.link/aoJvN0?object_uuid=6db2fdcd-2e56-4349-a967-c69bb78ad2e2&t=article) - which also includes the Ace Pro multi-filament printing module - for just $199 with free delivery. **You must sign in** to see the $231 price drop to $199 (no coupon code is necessary). This is the first time I've seen this model sell for under $200. The exact same combo sells for [$380 on Amazon](https://zdcs.link/av8m6W?object_uuid=6db2fdcd-2e56-4349-a967-c69bb78ad2e2&t=article).

You're buying it from Anycubic's official store on AliExpress. It ships free locally from the United States and arrives within 1 to 2 weeks. The Kobra 3 is an excellent option for any newcomer to 3D printing; it's easy to setup, it produces great 3D prints with minimal fiddling, there are plenty of mods available (that you can print yourself), all at a budget price.

## Anycubic Kobra 3 3D Printer Combo for $199

_**Includes the Ace Pro Multi-Filament Printing Module (for multiple colors)**_

The Anycubic Kobra 3 is an open bed printer with a working space measuring approximately 10" cubed. It boasts a print speed of up to 600mm/s with 20,000mm/s² acceleration and can print a benchy in under 12 minutes. Other features include an accelerometer G-sensor that allows for auto-leveling and vibration compensation, a 200W dual PTC heating system to keep a stable temp for consistent filament drying, and easy to use touchscreen controls. Assembly is quick and easy and you should be able to make your first test print in a matter of minutes.

The Ace Pro multi-filament module fleshes out the 3D printing capabilities. It's also what makes this deal so good because it normally sells for $200 or more by itself. This add-on allows you to print using up to four different colored filaments simultaneously. It features intelligent identification filament sync, nozzle clog detection, and active heating for filament drying. It also stores the filament in a sealed container to avoid foreign contamination.

Note that this is the newer "V2" model that was released in mid 2025. Updates include:

-   Wider Y-axis (60mm)
-   Upgraded SG15 searings on the X-axis
-   Improved nozzle design
-   Larger build volume
-   Built-in 720p camera
-   Up to 8-color native printing support

There are plenty of other 3D printer options out there. I've personally enjoyed using a [Bambu Lab 3D printer](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-buy-drops-200-off-the-bambu-p1s-3d-printer-during-bambu-labs-3rd-anniversary-sale). Keep in mind, however, that none of them will offer similar features (especially the multi-color printing) for even close to the same price.
