James Cameron's Avatar franchise has dominated the box office with each new release. The first Avatar movie is still the [highest grossing movie of all time](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/top_lifetime_gross/?area=XWW), with no signs of being dethroned from that title any time soon.

The third film in the series, Avatar: Fire and Ash, is still only available to watch in theaters. But if you're looking to stream the first two movies online, you can currently find them on Disney+. This is also where Fire and Ash will land once it gets a streaming release date.

## Where to Watch the Avatar Movies Online

[![Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/02/disneyhulumax-1-1748879533491.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/QpXAKZ?object_uuid=4c08159f-1d08-4ba7-b54d-35d3b5576114&t=article "Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max")

### Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max

$19.99/month with ads, $32.99/month ad-free

The Avatar movies are only available to stream on Disney+, but there are a few different ways to go about getting a subscription. While there are still [standalone Disney+ plans](https://www.ign.com/wikis/disney-plus/Plans_and_Pricing#Standalone_Disney.2B_Plans), there's also a series of different bundles available that are likely a better choice. I'd recommend either the Hulu and Disney+ bundle or the Hulu, Disney+, and HBO Max bundle to save as much as possible. There's also a [Hulu + Live TV free trial](https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-get-hulu-plus-live-tv-free-trial) available that includes Disney+ that you can check out if you want to avoid paying anything.

If you don't mind renting or buying digital movies, you can also find the first two films on VOD platforms like Prime Video and Apple TV.

### When will Avatar: Fire and Ash be available to watch at home?

We don't yet have a confirmed release date for Avatar: Fire and Ash. Films released by Disney (and the entertainment companies it owns) usually become available on VOD around two months after their theatrical release. Considering the Avatar franchises' track record at the box office, however, it's likely we won't see the film released on digital in February. The Way of Water was released on December 16, 2022 and didn't reach VOD platforms until March 28, 2023. If Fire and Ash follows a similar pattern, we'd be looking at a late March or early April 2026 release date.

As for when the new movie will come to Disney+, there's likely a much longer wait. Assuming Fire and Ash follows the same pattern as The Way of Water here, that would put the streaming release date sometime in early June 2026.

## The Future of the Avatar Franchise

It may seem inevitable that James Cameron would keep putting out Avatar movies, given their box office performance, but that might not end up being the case. Despite Avatar: Fire and Ash being one of the highest grossing movies of 2025, it apparently takes a surprising amount of money to break even with these films. James Cameron himself [commented on this](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0igvjcmgw4wYhAWvPzBauq?si=d40648c6b2d14b8c) before the latest film's theatrical release, saying, "I have no doubt in my mind that this movie will make money. The question is, does it make enough money to justify doing it again?”

In that same interview, he went on to say that if [Avatar 4](https://www.ign.com/movies/avatar-4) and 5 don't end up getting greenlit, he'd be happy to [write a book to tie up any loose threads left behind](https://www.ign.com/articles/james-cameron-says-if-avatar-fire-and-ash-doesnt-make-enough-money-to-justify-avatar-4-and-5-hes-ready-to-walk-away-and-write-a-book-to-resolve-the-one-thread-it-leaves-open). After the initial box office numbers rolled in for 2026, Cameron was spotted in another interview saying he'd need to find a [cheaper way to produce the next movies](https://www.ign.com/articles/james-cameron-says-he-must-find-a-cheaper-way-to-produce-the-avatar-movies-in-order-to-continue-with-avatar-4-and-5) to continue with the series. So as of right now, it's unclear if the series will continue or not.
