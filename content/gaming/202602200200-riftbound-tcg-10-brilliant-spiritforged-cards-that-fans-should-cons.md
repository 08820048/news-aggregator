The [League of Legends trading card game](https://www.ign.com/articles/new-league-of-legends-tcg-riftbound-has-posted-explosive-early-growth-since-launch-with-searches-surging-over-300) Riftbound's second set, titled Spiritforged, was released in the US on February 13. The newest expansion has been out in China for a couple of months now, and in the west for just over a week, sowe've seen a general picture of how the new cards are impacting the metagame thanks to two recent Regional Qualifiers in Fuzhou and Chengdu. With that being said, these are some of the best Spiritforged cards I think you should look into picking up now that the set is finally available.

## 10\. Blood Money

[![Blood Money](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/blood-money-1769449026423.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/QrJ8PE?object_uuid=9f03421a-f93c-43ce-a309-393e5d0daab0&t=article "Blood Money")

### Blood Money

At uncommon, this card is relatively easy to pick up at an affordable price as a single. This is a super cheap and efficient early removal spell to help you stay on tempo, and you'd be hard pressed to see Yellow decks like Viktor, Herald of the Arcane not running three copies.

## 9\. Card Sharp

[![Card Sharp](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/sharp-1769449063805.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/9ZAXeP?object_uuid=9f03421a-f93c-43ce-a309-393e5d0daab0&t=article "Card Sharp")

### Card Sharp

Card Sharp is pretty versatile. There are a few Power hungry decks with Spiritforged, so being able to offset some of that cost with the Gold generated from Card Sharp and pressure with a 3 MIght body is worth considering.

## 8\. Not So Fast

[![Not So Fast](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/not-so-fast-1769449104426.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/9l8OP0?object_uuid=9f03421a-f93c-43ce-a309-393e5d0daab0&t=article "Not So Fast")

### Not So Fast

Thanks to the [recent errata to refexive triggers](https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/rules-and-releases/riftbound-spiritforged-faq/), nerfing cards like [Icathian Rain](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/653046/riftbound-league-of-legends-trading-card-game-origins-icathian-rain), Not So Fast got significantly better. Before, you'd only be able to counter just one instance of damage, but now you can just counter the entire spell with Not So Fast. Definitely keep this card on your radar if you like Green decks.

## 7\. Bellows Breath

[![Bellows Breath](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/breath-1769449146239.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/aD8MlW?object_uuid=9f03421a-f93c-43ce-a309-393e5d0daab0&t=article "Bellows Breath")

### Bellows Breath

The new Repeat mechanic offers a more dynamic way to interact with opponents. Bellows Breath is one of these, being able to clear a Battlefield of smaller units in the early game.

## 6\. Trinity Force

[![Trinity Force](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/trinity-force-1769449182075.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/Qd8lnx?object_uuid=9f03421a-f93c-43ce-a309-393e5d0daab0&t=article "Trinity Force")

### Trinity Force

One of my favorite new equipments from the set, Trinity Force is one of the few cards that allow you to store extra points. I can see this making waves in Master Yi, Wuju Bladesman, as his Legend ability buffs defending units. In the Origins meta, the deck was great at holding to score points, and looks to be the same situation with Spiritforged.

## 5\. Piercing Light

[![Piercing Light](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/piercing-light-1769449226853.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/aB85rV?object_uuid=9f03421a-f93c-43ce-a309-393e5d0daab0&t=article "Piercing Light")

### Piercing Light

Like Bellows Breath, this can be an early game removal spell for tempo, or an easy two-for-one later on. Kai'Sa, Daughter of the Void typically ran two to three copies of [Falling Star](https://zdcs.link/z64yqj?object_uuid=9f03421a-f93c-43ce-a309-393e5d0daab0&t=article), so I can see this finding a home in that deck too.

## 4\. Ferrous Forerunner

[![Ferrous Forerunner](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/runner-1769449257801.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/aMKg1L?object_uuid=9f03421a-f93c-43ce-a309-393e5d0daab0&t=article "Ferrous Forerunner")

### Ferrous Forerunner

Ferrous Forerunner is a big body that continues to pressure your opponent even after it dies. Doing its best [Wurmcoil Engine](https://zdcs.link/aA85lL?object_uuid=9f03421a-f93c-43ce-a309-393e5d0daab0&t=article) impression, this guy will spit out two 3 Might Mech tokens upon death, allowing you to maintain your board presence.

## 3\. Called Shot

[![Called Shot](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/shot-1769449289616.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/av8weE?object_uuid=9f03421a-f93c-43ce-a309-393e5d0daab0&t=article "Called Shot")

### Called Shot

Even if Called Shot had 1 Energy cost, I would consider extremely powerful. At 0 Energy _and_ sporting the Repeat mechanic has convinced me it's the best draw and filter spell in the game. With a ton of ways to generate Gold tokens to help pay Power costs, this card is positioned to be seen in every Purple deck.

## 2\. Guardian Angel

[![Guardian Angel](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/angel-1769449372810.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/QV5xO1?object_uuid=9f03421a-f93c-43ce-a309-393e5d0daab0&t=article "Guardian Angel")

### Guardian Angel

Guardian Angel is essentially copies four through 6 of [Zhonya's Hourlgass](https://zdcs.link/QLpyVX?object_uuid=9f03421a-f93c-43ce-a309-393e5d0daab0&t=article), which has the same effect. This, however, is an equipment, so it comes with a +1 Might buff and costs a Power to equip to a unit. Master Yi, Wuju Bladesman is still poised to be a contender with Spiritforged, and this card is one reason for that.

## 1\. Ezreal, Prodigy

[![Ezreal, Prodigy](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/ezreal-1769449406640.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/zE8DlM?object_uuid=9f03421a-f93c-43ce-a309-393e5d0daab0&t=article "Ezreal, Prodigy")

### Ezreal, Prodigy

While Draven, Glorious Executioner is easily the strongest deck in the Spiritforged meta, many lists are playing Ezreal, Prodigy, which is the best card in the set for my money.

Purple is undoubtedly very strong, and Ezreal's effect allows you to filter through your deck and a lot cards early, and fits into a few other archetypes nicely.

## Where to Buy Riftbound: Spiritforged

If you prefer the rush of cracking packs hoping to pull your favorite chase cards, below are the [Spiritforged sealed products available for purchase](https://www.ign.com/articles/league-of-legends-riftbound-tcg-spiritforged-where-to-buy-2026).

Like Origins before it, the second set is already sold out on Riot's online storefront, but you can order through TCGplayer at pretty high markups if you're desperate to secure the goods.
