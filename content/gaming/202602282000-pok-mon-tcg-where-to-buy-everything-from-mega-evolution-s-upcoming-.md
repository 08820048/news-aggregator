The pulse of Lumiose City is racing, and for good reason! Pre-orders for the [Pokémon TCG](https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop): Mega Evolution - Perfect Order expansion are dropping ahead of its March 27, 2026, release. This gorgeous new set continues the Mega Evolution hype of [Pokémon Legends: Z-A](https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a), bringing Mega Zygarde ex into the spotlight.

This guide collects the best deals on the market right now for Pokémon Perfect Order boosters and ETBs, including line-ups, predicted chase cards, and what to expect from this latest collection.

We’ll be regularly updating this page with confirmed deals, so bookmark this page, keep checking back in, and follow [@IGNDeals](https://x.com/IGNDeals) for the latest updates.

### **What’s in the Perfect Order Lineup?**

As the third main expansion of cards from the Mega Evolution Series of the Pokémon Trading Card Game, this set has over 120 cards. There’s plenty to get your hands on, because let’s be real, we’re not just buying one.

-   Booster Packs
-   Booster Boxes (36 packs)
-   Elite Trainer Box
-   Pokémon Center Exclusive Elite Trainer Box
-   Booster Bundle (6 packs)
-   Triple-Pack Blisters (Meganium, Cinderace, Steelix, Clawitzer, Makuhita)

Perfect Order will introduce new mechanics, four Mega Evolution Pokémon ex; nine Pokémon ex; 11 illustration rare Pokémon; 18 ultra rare Pokémon and Trainer cards; and six special illustration rare Pokémon and Supporter cards.Look out for Mega Zygarde ex, Mega Clefable ex, Mega Starmie ex, and the newly revealed Mega Skarmory ex!

Seemingly confirmed via Japanese set lists (M3), which historically dictate about 90% of what we see in our English releases, it will also introduce [Telepath Psychic Energy](https://limitlesstcg.com/cards/jp/M3/79?translate=en), which provides psychic energy as long as this card is attached to a Pokémon. Neat!

### **Where to Preorder Pokémon TCG Perfect Order**

While preordering ensures you get what you want, there’s no saying what the market will do in the weeks following release. Here are the most reliable sources right now, but we’re still waiting for a few preorders to drop.

**TCGplayer**

TCGPlayer is a reliable third-party retailer that has [all Perfect Order options](https://zdcs.link/zJ8gJq?object_uuid=a03d3eb2-539e-401a-b70f-14e1aa04e142&t=article) available for preorder. This is your best option for securing everything at the moment, but only if you're ultimately comfortable with paying over MSRP.

Albeit, compared to previous expansions, Perfect Order's market price isn't _that_ far over standard pricing. For example, a [booster box set is running for around $200 right now](https://zdcs.link/zJ83Wp?object_uuid=a03d3eb2-539e-401a-b70f-14e1aa04e142&t=article), about $40 more than Best Buy is selling it for at MSRP.

It's a similar story for the [Elite Trainer Boxes, listed at around $100 market price](https://zdcs.link/QqJVo3?object_uuid=a03d3eb2-539e-401a-b70f-14e1aa04e142&t=article), which is $50 more than MSRP. But, that's already $20 less than the recently released Ascended Heroes, and far better than the average $150-$200 we see more regularly. Hopefully Perfect Order follows the same trend as Phantasmal Flames and drops below $100 soon.

**Walmart**

Walmart will likely have Perfect Order preorders between now and release day on March 27. To be in the best chance to securing anything at MSRP, you'll need to be a paid Walmart+ member to early access to the drops. No free trial option here, you'll need to be paying for your membership to be in the race.

[![Walmart+ Membership](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/06/walmart-1759757062856.png?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/QW6wG7?object_uuid=a03d3eb2-539e-401a-b70f-14e1aa04e142&t=article "Walmart+ Membership")

### Walmart+ Membership

**Pokémon Center US**

The classic, and always the first to sell out. You’ll get the absolute best price (MSRP) and the exclusive Pokémon Center ETB, which has two copies of a full-art foil promo card featuring Tyrunt (one with a Pokémon Center logo).

-   Perfect Order Pokémon Center [Elite Trainer Box](https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/10-10372-109/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-perfect-order-pokemon-center-elite-trainer-box) - $59.99
-   Perfect Order [Booster Display Box](https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/10-10380-119/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-perfect-order-booster-display-box-36-packs) (36 Packs) - $161.64
-   Perfect Order [Booster Bundle](https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/10-10377-109/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-perfect-order-booster-bundle-6-packs) (6 Packs) - $26.94

Keep an eye out for restocks as March approaches.

**Best Buy**

Best Buy often has "Coming Soon" listings, and launches pre-orders closer to release than other retailers. Pre-orders haven’t gone live here yet, so keep checking back.

-   Perfect Order [Elite Trainer Box](https://zdcs.link/QrJ2eE?object_uuid=a03d3eb2-539e-401a-b70f-14e1aa04e142&t=article) - $49.99
-   Perfect Order [Booster Box](https://zdcs.link/9ZA1lP?object_uuid=a03d3eb2-539e-401a-b70f-14e1aa04e142&t=article) (36 Packs) - $160.99

Remember - it also offers "Pick up in-store" options, which are always popular. If you want to risk it, keep your local Best Buy in mind for release day.

**Amazon**

Perfect Order is an English curated localization of the Japanese Nihil Zero expansion. Amazon US currently has no listing for Perfect Order. But, we usually see the online retailer begin to stock new sets after release, so keep an eye out through to March 27.

**Predicted Chase Cards**

We can look at the SAR pull rates from the Japanese Nihil Zero expansion and secondary market prices in Japan to predict chase cards for the US market.

Unsurprisingly, the new Mega Ultra Rare [Mega Zygarde ex](https://pokeninjapan.store/products/117-080-mega-zygarde-ex-japanese-pokemon-single-card?) (card #117/080 in the Japanese set) fetches a pretty penny on Japanese marketplace PokeninJapan thanks to its "Nullifying Zero" attack mechanic. [{115/080} Rosa's Encouragement](https://pokeninjapan.store/products/115-080-rosas-encouragement-japanese-pokemon-single-card) is also trending high.

As the March 27 2026 release draws ever-closer, we’re sure to see more pre-orders dropping. Keep checking back for more information!
