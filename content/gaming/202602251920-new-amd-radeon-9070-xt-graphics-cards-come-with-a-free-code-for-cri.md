Similar to every other high-end [GPU](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-graphics-card) on the market, the AMD Radeon 9070 XT graphics card is selling for above MSRP in 2026. Fortunately, it's not as egregiously marked up as [Nvidia cards](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nvidia-graphics-cards), and now there's an even better incentive. For a limited time, you can [purchase an AMD Radeon 9070 XT GPU on Amazon and get a free Crimson Desert code](https://zdcs.link/9wBXny?object_uuid=697de36d-a44c-4822-ac72-c6de2c8fcb41&t=article). Since Crimson Desert isn't out yet, you'll have to wait to download the full version of the game when it releases on March 19.

### The Radeon RX 9070 XT Received a 10/10 at IGN

The AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT is the only 2025-released GPU that [we gave a 10/10 score](https://www.ign.com/articles/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-review). Even though it costs $150 less than the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, the 9070 XT beats it out in several of the games we tested. In a few benchmarks, the results aren't even close. The 9070 XT approaches the performance of the $1,000 RX 7900 XTX but with better ray tracing and upscaling performance than its predecessor.

This is the least expensive graphics card from either AMD or Nvidia that I would comfortably recommend for playing the latest and most demanding games in 4K at 60fps or higher framerates.

### The Sapphire Nitro+ Radeon RX 7900 XTX GPU is the best model to get

### Sapphitre Nitro+ AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT 16GB Gaming OC Graphics Card

The Sapphire Nitro+ is widely considered the best models to get. Much like the high-end ASUS ROG Strix, the Nitro+ features a beefy vapor chamber cooling system, impeccable build quality, and as a result, high overclocking headroom and lower noise potential. It's usually a lot more expensive than other models but currently the price difference between this and the cheapest 9070 XT option listed on the page is only $80.

### Crimson Desert is out on March 19

Crimson Desert is an upcoming open-world game for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X platforms that will be released on March 19. The studio, Pearl Abyss, also created the popular MMORPG [Black Desert](https://www.ign.com/games/black-desert). Whereas Black Desert was a free-to-play game with microtransactions and gacha elements, Crimson Desert will be a [primarily offline](https://www.ign.com/articles/this-is-a-premium-experience-that-is-the-transaction-full-stop-crimson-desert-dev-rules-out-microtransactions-or-a-cosmetic-cash-shop) single-player experience [with a retail price of $69.99](https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-where-to-buy). Getting it for free with your CPU upgrade, then, is a great perk.
