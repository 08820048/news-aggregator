While the latest Silent Hill movie hasn't made waves at the box office, it’s fair to be curious about what one of [best horror games of all time](https://variety.com/2026/film/features/return-to-silent-hill-director-death-threats-game-fans-1236638923/) could look like on film. At the very least, there's some entertainment value to bickering with the screen about whatever adaptation decisions you do or don't support.

If you weren’t willing to trek out to the theaters for it, Return to Silent Hill is already available to rent or buy through VOD services [like Prime Video](https://zdcs.link/ae8wA7?object_uuid=303811a4-bb42-41ab-8672-e829d7ddd41f&t=article).

## Return to Silent Hill Lands on Digital

### Return to Silent Hill

RETURN TO SILENT HILL follows James, a man broken after his relationship with the love of his life, Mary, ends. When a mysterious letter from her calls him back to Silent Hill, he finds a once-recognizable town transformed by an unknown evil.

Return to Silent Hill initially released to the lowest domestic box office opening [in the franchise's history](https://www.ign.com/articles/return-to-silent-hill-debuts-to-lowest-us-box-office-opening-in-franchise-history). It has since grossed over $5 million in the U.S., while the international box office has pushed it to a total gross of [over $42 million](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl3922296833/). According to [Variety](https://variety.com/2026/film/features/return-to-silent-hill-director-death-threats-game-fans-1236638923/), the film was produced on a budget of $23 million before marketing costs.

The latest Silent Hill movie has landed on digital platforms almost exactly four weeks after its release in theaters, a relatively quick turnaround. The film’s digital pricing at the time of writing is also more reasonable than most other digital releases we’ve seen this year, with the full purchase [listed at $19.99](https://zdcs.link/ae8wA7?object_uuid=303811a4-bb42-41ab-8672-e829d7ddd41f&t=article) and renting available [for just $9.99](https://zdcs.link/ae8wA7?object_uuid=303811a4-bb42-41ab-8672-e829d7ddd41f&t=article).

While [IGN’s review](https://www.ign.com/articles/return-to-silent-hill-movie-review) acknowledges that “those craving a truly great psychological horror experience are better off booting up a version of Silent Hill 2,” I respect any fan (or potential fan) getting a little curious. The film retains the game’s core premise of James Sunderland ‘returning’ to Silent Hill in pursuit of his wife, Mary. Most of the game’s core characters also appear, though with some particularly interesting casting and flashback decisions. All to say, there’s a [mix of faithfulness and revisionism](https://www.ign.com/articles/return-to-silent-hill-movie-what-was-and-wasnt-changed-2-adaptation) in this particular adaptation.

One strength of the film, at least according to our review, is the craftsmanship that went into recreating Silent Hill's atmosphere, aided by the [return of Akira Yamaoka as the film's composer](https://www.ign.com/articles/akira-yamaoka-on-remaking-silent-hill-2s-soundtrack-again-for-return-to-silent-hill). Director Christophe Gans has [more recently claimed](https://www.ign.com/articles/return-to-silent-hill-director-reveals-he-was-required-to-keep-the-length-under-2-hours-and-hopes-fans-can-watch-a-longer-directors-cut-someday) that he was forced to edit the movie down to under two hours, with hopes of one day releasing his full Director’s Cut.

Otherwise, the Silent Hill franchise has certainly [ramped up](https://www.ign.com/articles/konami-revealed-3-new-silent-hill-games-at-once-so-fans-knew-it-was-serious-about-resurrecting-the-horror-franchise) over the past couple of years with Bloober Team’s [Silent Hill 2 Remake](https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-2024-review) as well as Konami’s most recent release, [Silent Hill f](https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-review). Another new game, [Silent Hill Townfall](https://www.ign.com/articles/first-person-silent-hill-townfall-transports-the-series-survival-horror-to-scotland), is slated for release sometime in 2026.
