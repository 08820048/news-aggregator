Mattel's classic Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars toy line was one of the first options for Marvel collectors who craved action figures of their favorite Marvel heroes, and Hasbro is continuing to tap into the enduring nostalgia for that line in 2026. The company revealed a second wave of Secret Wars figures that will come packaged on retro-style cardbacks.

Along with the new wave of Secret Wars figures, Hasbro also showed off a two-pack of figures inspired by the Disney+ series Daredevil: Born Again, multiple '90s-themed X-Men figures, and the latest addition to their collector-oriented Marvel Legends Maximum Series. Get a closer look at everything in the slideshow gallery below:

As with the first wave, this batch of Secret Wars figures focuses mainly on characters who featured in the original Mattel toyline and/or the Secret Wars comic. This wave includes Spider-Man (Alien Costume), Daredevil, Falcon, Magik, Constrictor, and Absorbing Man. These figures are priced at $27.99 each and will be released in Spring 2026.

Hasbro revealed a pair of new two-pack sets, one of which being the aforementioned Born Again-style Bullseye and Muse set and the other a Black Widow/Quicksilver set inspired by the early '00s Avengers comics. Each pack is priced at $55.99 and will be released in Spring 2026.

On the X-Men front, iconic '90s villain Onslaught is getting a new figure with appropriate vintage packaging, and Archangel also gets a new deluxe release with plenty of accessories. Each figure is priced at $39.99, with Archangel releasing in Spring 2026 and Onslaught in Fall 2026.

Finally, Thor is joining Hasbro's Marvel Legends Maximum Series, which focuses on more high-end releases with added accessories. This particular Thor figure depicts the Odinson in his Olivier Coipel-designed csotume from the late '00s, which should palease the many colelctors who were clamoring for a new version of that particular look.

Maximum Thor is priced at $55.99 and will be released in Spring 2026.
