Published Feb 9, 2026, 9:56 AM EST Made in Abyss will return soon with a movie Anime's most disturbing hidden gem is getting a sequel movie in 2026 Made in Abyss characters Riko and Reg flying togetherImage: Kadokawa Sign in to your Polygon account Few anime from the last decade have been more polarizing than Made in Abyss​​​​​. Based on the web manga by Akihito Tsukushi, this series marries inventiveness, mystery, and some of the most brutal exploration of the dark side of humanity, with disturbing scenes often involving deceptively cute characters. After two seasons (aired in 2017 and 2022, respectively) and a 2020 movie, Made in Abyss will continue as a film franchise. Kicking things off, Made in Abyss: Awakening Mystery is now confirmed for a fall 2026 release. The Made in Abyss X account shared a trailer on Feb. 8, which features scenes from the previous seasons and a brief preview of what lies in wait — all punctuated by a beautiful, haunting score. The main staff from anime studio Kinema Citrus is returning to the production, along with the previous voice actors for the main characters. Made in Abyss is set in a fictional world where a colossal chasm opens in the ground of a solitary island. This mysterious territory, known as the Abyss, extends for an unknown length and hides secrets, precious artifacts from ancient civilizations, and bizarre creatures. The Cave Raiders are brave explorers who descend into the layers of the Abyss, but they have to deal with the Abyss Curse, a mysterious illness that afflicts people who try to return to the surface. The deeper one goes into the Abyss, the deadlier the curse effects are. The story's protagonist, Riko, is an orphan following in the footsteps of her mother, a legendary White Whistle (the highest tier of Raiders) who apparently died after reaching the elusive bottom of the Abyss. Image: Kadokawa It's impossible to summarize all the mysteries and oddities of the story. Even after watching the entire anime or reading the manga, so many things about the Abyss still have to be explained, which keeps fans hooked even between the series' long hiatuses. But this is not the only reason why Made in Abyss garnered such a massive fandom. The story is gripping and brutal. The Abyss is a merciless place where survival is never guaranteed, and Raiders sometimes resort to murdering each other in order to survive. The human beings who descent into its depths are inevitably changed, and the series relishes in the exploration of that true, exposed nature. With Awakened Mystery coming later this year, there's never been a better time to catch up with Made in Abyss. The anime is available on Prime Video in the U.S. and HIDIVE globally.
