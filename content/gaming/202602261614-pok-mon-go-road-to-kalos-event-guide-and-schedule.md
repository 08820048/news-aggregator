Ahead of [_Pokémon Go_](https://www.polygon.com/game/pokemon-go/38713/)'s Go Tour: Kalos event, we're getting a **"Road to Kalos"** event that features different Pokémon every day up until Saturday, Feb. 28. That being said, we're ditching our usual event page format to give you the details about what each day of the event entails.

Below, we talk about the general perks that are part of _Pokémon Go_'s "Road to Kalos" event, as well as the schedule for the daily bonuses that change.

**Update (Feb. 26)**: We've added information about Thursday's Sinnoh portion of the event.

## All Pokémon Go 'Road to Kalos' event perks

During the event, all eggs placed into Incubators will get **halved hatch distance**, and the Remote Raid limit will increase to 30 per day. Additionally, you can find Zygarde Cells on up to five Routes per day, and you can use TMs to remove Frustration from shadow Pokémon. Also, as a bonus for the full event, **Dratini, Larvitar, Bagon, Beldum, and Gible will hatch from 2 km eggs**, which should appear more frequently when you spin PokéStops and gyms. Each day will also feature a **raid hour from 6-7 p.m.** in your local time that focuses on the respective featured legendaries, as well.

The Go Pass: Road to Kalos battle pass is also active, rewarding you with an Unbound Hoopa at the first level and a Lucky Trinket at the end of the battle pass. The pass also gives a ton of [Link Charges](https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-super-mega-raids-link-charges-how-to-get/) as rewards on both the free and deluxe track, though of course, the deluxe track ($14.99) gives out more. If you buy this ticket, any Pokémon you [Mega Evolve](https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/22447919/mega-evolution-list-candy-bonus-buddy-raids/) will earn six points per evolution towards its Mega Level.

As part of the event, there's a Timed Research with different steps rolling out on the following days. The **"Portals to Power" research** starts with a prelude step that has you claiming the reward in order to get one Incense. You need to claim this reward before the other Timed Research appears.

The other bonuses below are broken up by day, with different days offering different spawns, raid targets, and Timed Research. You can see the bonuses for each day below, and we'll update this guide as we get info for the following days.
