[Arc Raiders](https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders) players heading topside for the new Shrouded Sky update have their tin foil hats on after video of a mysterious UFO started circulating online.

Just as soon as clips of [the new Firefly and Comet Arc threats](https://www.ign.com/articles/embark-shows-off-arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-update-with-first-look-at-two-new-threatsand-beards) began making the rounds on social media, so too has footage of a mysterious being not detailed in the [patch notes](https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-update-patch-notes-reveal-nerfs-for-pvp-and-pve-players-as-shrouded-sky-brings-new-threats-to-the-rust-belt).

It’s unnerving at best and terrifying at worst, but things get spookier upon closer inspection. The low visibility brought about by the Hurricane makes it hard to get a good look at the lights, making it seem as though the Raider is watching two groups of drones moving quicker than normal. Watch again, and you’ll see those lights are attached to an enormous ship, gliding through the storm.

The AI entity known as the Arc is capable of many things. Drones, death orbs, giant spider-like robots, and more are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to enemy types, but players haven’t seen anything quite like the UFO shown in the clip. Studying it hasn’t been easier either, as only a [few](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rdjr0s/arc_ships_soon_in_arc_raiders/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) [others](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rdtzgs/new_cloaked_arc_on_new_event/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) have managed to capture and share their sightings online while developer Embark Studios remains silent.

It feels reminiscent of the time game developer Arrowhead Studios launched an update for Helldivers 2 that [quietly added flying bug enemies](https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-just-quietly-added-flying-bugs-ceo-insists-bugs-cant-fly) without notifying players in its patch notes. As players spun a web of theories, that team denied that such creatures could possibly exist. Now, Embark seems to be following a similar strategy, leaving players to try and piece together what a building-sized UFO could mean for the future of Arc Raiders. Some even believe these sightings could be tied to the new large Arc [teased to arrive with the Riven Tides update this April](https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-roadmap-promises-a-new-map-more-arcs-and-even-a-little-love-for-scrappy-by-april-2026).

“Is that the f\*\*\*ing mothership???” one player [guessed](https://x.com/MartonPiller012/status/2026315685253583170?s=20).

“No explaining the thing will be murdering people probably in April,” one player [theorized](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rdgkdw/comment/o753bi6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). “Who knows it could be the new ‘large arc threat’ they roadmapped. That would be cool af. A flying gigantic arc matriarch/queen type battle.”

We played through multiple raids since Shrouded Sky launched and were successful in seeing the ship just once. Although Bewarden was able to catch a glimpse of the UFO on Spaceport, our sighting occurred on Buried City. While we were also able to hear the ship fly overhead during a Blue Gate raid, it sped off before we could get a good look at it.

If you’re interested in hunting down the latest Arc Raiders mystery, we recommend playing during the Hurricane map condition and keeping your eyes on the sky around the time the raid has reached the halfway mark (about 15 minutes). Based on our testing and what others are sharing online, don’t expect to catch one of these on your first run.

This isn’t the first time Arc Raiders fans have spotted giant Arc in the distance, but don’t expect Embark to come out with an explanation any time soon. While we wait for updates, you can read our [interview with studio CEO Patrick Söderlund](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-arc-raiders-interview-embark-boss-patrick-sderlund-talks-live-service-plans-banning-cheaters-and-the-secret-sauce-of-pve) to learn more about [how the team will continue to shape Speranza](https://www.ign.com/articles/huge-success-of-arc-raiders-gives-embark-financial-security-and-employment-stability-75-million-budget-estimate-not-too-far-off) and the enigmatic, post-apocalyptic Rust Belt.
