Horror director Mike Flanagan is once again linking up with iconic author Stephen King for a new movie adaptation of The Mist, reports [Deadline](https://deadline.com/2026/02/stephen-king-the-mist-movie-mike-flanagan-warner-bros-1236714497/).

Based on King’s 1980 sci fi horror novella, first published in a Viking Press horror anthology in 1980, The Mist is the story of a group of survivors stuck in small-town Maine by a thick fog that’s enveloped the whole area, which conceals deadly creatures. The Mist was nominated for a number of literary awards at the time and is typically considered amongst King’s most well-regarded works. Flanagan is on deck to direct, and will write the screenplay.

The Mist was previously adapted into a movie back in 2007, starring Thomas Jane and directed by Frank Darabont, who had previously directed 1994’s The Shawshank Redemption and 1999’s The Green Mile (which were also based on Stephen King stories). It was also adapted into a short-lived, 10-episode TV series in 2017, though it was cancelled the same year it aired.

This new adaptation will join a lengthy list of existing King collaborations for Flanagan, including 2017’s Gerald’s Game, 2019’s Doctor Sleep (the sequel to The Shining), and 2024’s The Life of Chuck. Flanagan is also working on [an eight-episode TV adaptation of Carrie for Prime Video](https://www.ign.com/articles/carrie-the-stephen-king-classic-that-became-a-horror-movie-icon-is-becoming-an-8-episode-prime-video-series). King’s first published novel, Carrie has previously been adapted into film on three separate occasions.

Flanagan is also currently leading a new Exorcist movie project, which [Scarlett Johansson joined late last year.](https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-jurassic-world-star-scarlett-johansson-joins-mike-flanagans-new-exorcist-movie)
