Last night's Sony State of Play broadcast ended with an announcement and shadow drop for [God of War Sons of Sparta](https://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta), a side-scrolling spin-off listed as having 1-2 player support via the PlayStation Store. The only problem? Fans can't find its two-player option.

Early reports from those who've paid the game's $29.99 asking price and revisited Kratos' origins say that his sibling Deimos only appears at certain points, there's no two-player option in the game's menus, and plugging in a second PS5 controller doesn't provide extra options.

It's an odd situation that's led some to suspect the PlayStation Store [listing](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012744) is simply incorrect — as it appears to be the only firm evidence a two-player mode exists — and seek help from others online also searching for its multiplayer.

Writing on reddit and social media, fans say the store's listing didn't initially seem odd — since the game's title is "Sons of Sparta" plural, in-game footage shows the two brothers killing bosses together, and its cover artwork focuses on them fighting side-by-side.

The game's store description could also be ready ambiguously, referencing the exploits of both brothers:

"Experience an untold chapter in Kratos' journey set during the harsh years of Spartan training alongside his brother Deimos," Sons of Sparta's official blurb reads. "Through endless trials, their minds, bodies, and hearts have been molded to become Spartan soldiers for whom duty and honor mean everything. After a fellow cadet goes missing, Kratos and Deimos vow to find him and embark on an adventure that will put their training and Spartan spirit to the test."

"Just got it installed and running," wrote God of War fan Mephistocheles on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1r38od8/god_of_war_sons_of_sparta_metroidvania_announced/), in a lengthy thread with much discussion on the game's lack of co-op play. "So far it's not allowing drop in play on 2nd controller and there were no two-player options on start menu. Will update if I find it does allow co-op, but it doesn't look like it."

"I’m so sad," wrote bob\_th4\_build3r. "I bought it instantly because i thought it would be co-op… maybe they will add it in the future?"

Other comments say they are now escalating the matter to PlayStation's customer support, while several fans say they have tried to request refunds. IGN has contacted PlayStation and Sons of Sparta developer Mega Cat Studios for clarification on the game's two-player capabilities, or lack thereof.

Sony's State of Play show also included the [surprise announcement of a God of War Trilogy Remake](https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-side-scrolling-spin-off-out-today-and-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-announced-sony-state-of-play), though work on the project at Sony Santa Monica is still in its early stages.
