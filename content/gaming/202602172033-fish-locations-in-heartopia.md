Where to find fish in Heartopia

**Fishing** in [_Heartopia_](https://www.polygon.com/heartopia/) is one of the more lucrative hobbies, as you can sell the fish you catch (or even better, [cook](https://www.polygon.com/heartopia-guide-cooking-recipes-list-ingredients-unlock/) it and then sell it). As you level up the fishing hobby, you'll be able to find more fish around the island, if you know where to look. If you're looking to complete your fishing collection, we're here to help.

Below we explain how fishing works in _Heartopia_ and where to find many of the fish in game, along with what weather and time requirements they may have.

## How fishing works in Heartopia

Fishing is one of the early hobbies you'll unlock in _Heartopia_. To fish, you'll simply need to walk up to a fish-shaped shadow in the water, cast your line onto it, and reel in the fish once it bites. You'll need to hold down the button to reel in the fish (either tapping/clicking the screen or holding down "F" on PC), and release the button when your line starts flashing red. Once your line turns white again, you can go back to reeling in the fish, repeating the process until the fish is caught.

As a pro tip, you can cast your line further out or closer to you by clicking/tapping the fish button and dragging your finger or your mouse out or forward for a more accurate aim.

If you're seeking out a specific fish to complete your fishing collection, we recommend using **bait** (either made using three apples or purchased from Vanya) to chum the waters to get fish quickly. If you're level four or higher, you can also opt to buy **Mermaid Fish Attractors** from Vanya, which will rapidly spawn in fish in a small area. Once you hit level six, you can also buy **Mermaid Perfume**, which lets you skip the reeling minigame and instantly catch your fish. (Notably some of the [_Heartopia_](https://www.polygon.com/heartopia-codes-redeem-how-to/) codes for free items give out both attractors and perfume, as of writing this.)

Many of the later fish will only spawn in certain situations, such as specific times or weather, with some fish only appearing when you use a Mermaid Fish Attractor or while you're out at the Sea Fishing event.

Similarly to the other hobbies, leveling up your fishing will unlock more fish for you to catch, as well as better passive abilities that increase your fish quality, improve your fishing rod durability, and increase the chances of instantly reeling in fish.

As of writing this, the fishing level cap is 14.

## Heartopia fish location list

Below we list all the fish we have found and confirmed in _Heartopia_ so far. (Note that our list is missing a few, as we're only level nine and we're waiting on some specific weather conditions.) We'll update this guide with more fish as we catch and confirm the information about them.

You can check what time of day it is by opening your menu and seeing which of the sun/moons is highlighted. The first moon with the "zz" is nighttime, the rising sun is morning, the full sun is daytime, and the moon with a single star is evening.

The list below does not include limited-time event fish.​
