### 77" LG Evo G5 4K OLED Smart TV

The G5 is the current generation (2025) Gallery series model. LG's Gallery series TV is LG's highest end OLED TV and perhaps the best OLED TV, period. That means it's superior to the more mainstream LG C5. Although both TVs are equipped with a premium "Evo" panel that's already better than traditional W-OLED TVs, the G-series goes one step further by incorporating MLA (micro lens array) technology, which significantly improves brightness.

[We picked the LG Gallery series as one of our favorite TVs for gaming](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tv-for-gaming). It has all the features you'd want in a current generation gaming TV, including a native 120Hz-165Hz panel and four HDMI 2.1 ports that can run games in 4K at 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X console. It supports variable refresh rate (VRR) and auto low latency mode (ALLM).

One note to keep in mind is that none of the LG G-series TVs include a stand. They are meant to be mounted on the wall like an art installation (hence the "Gallery" monikor). Instead, a flush mount wall bracket is included.
