### X-Men: Blue & Gold - Mutant Genesis Omnibus

Chris Claremont and Jim Lee's iconic run on the X-Men started in the late 80's and introduced new characters like Bishop and Omega Red, and some of the most popular designs of the X-Men we've ever seen came from this run.

The 1,360-page hardcover omnibus collects up to 12 years of X-Men comics, documenting the whole Blue & Gold saga, fights against Magneot, the Brood, and more, and all the supplemental issues to get the whole story in one. Here's everything included:

-   X-Men #1-16
-   Uncanny X-Men #281-297
-   Uncanny X-Men Annual #16
-   Ghost Rider #26-27
-   X-Factor #84-86
-   X-Force #16-18
-   Stryfe's Strike File #1

This omnibus also includes material from certain issues to help flesh out the overall story's context, but not their full issues. The extra material includes excerpts from:

-   X-Force Annual #1
-   X-Force Annual #7
-   Marvel Comics Presents #89
-   X-Men: Odd Men Out

This run's original X-Men issue #1 quickly become the highest selling single issue comic book of all time, and has since sold over 8 million copies. Featuring a massive wrap-around cover art from now-legendary comic artist Jim Lee, it's one of the most recognizable pieces of X-Men art to date, if not one of the most recognizable comic book covers of all time. X-Men: The Animated Series, and X-Men '97 after it, were directly inspired by these comics.
