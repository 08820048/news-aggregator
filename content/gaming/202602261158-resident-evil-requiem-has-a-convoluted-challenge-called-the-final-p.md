[Resident Evil Requiem](https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem) includes numerous Easter eggs and unlockable extras, but none seemingly as complex as 'The Final Puzzle.'

_**Warning!**_ _Resident Evil Requiem puzzle spoilers follow:_

As with other recent Resident Evil games, Requiem includes a list of challenges which add completion points to your playthrough score. At the bottom of the list is the appropriately-named 'The Final Puzzle' — which is proving to be something of a headscratcher.

[IGN has a work-in-progress guide to The Final Puzzle](https://www.ign.com/wikis/resident-evil-requiem/Final_Challenge_Puzzle_Solution) where significant progress has been made through the challenge's convoluted early stages, which feel more complex than anything seen in any other Resident Evil game to date — and, seemingly, with still some way left to go.

Exactly what the final outcome or reward for the challenge might be remains unknown — but as the game continues its launch around the world, the hunt for answers here will undoubtedly become a major point of community focus.

The game's own description for the challenge offers only the vaguest of hints, to "Let the sweet pair hear the voice." The mechanics of the puzzle, or at least its first part, appear to rely on players picking up or examining a variety of objects throughout the game to determine fragments of a code.

Requiem's trail of clues relies on players picking up a specific severed hand which, if obtained, can also be scanned later on to provide a hidden RNA code in a blood sample analysis machine. Other items also hide their own codes, providing (with a bit more puzzling work) a version of that RNA sequence that can be plugged into a safe that features buttons labelled with a Star, Sun and Moon.

After that... well, it's here the trail has gone cold, though likely not for long. We'll be keeping an eye on further progress made throughout the next few days, as players uncover further steps. For now, however, it's just fun to see that the game hides this kind of puzzle.

For a far more granular look at each step to-date, [IGN's work-in-progress guide to The Final Puzzle](https://www.ign.com/wikis/resident-evil-requiem/Final_Challenge_Puzzle_Solution) is right here. We've also logged [how long Resident Evil Requiem takes to beat](https://www.ign.com/articles/how-long-is-resident-evil-requiem), and tracked [Resident Evil Requiem's global release times](https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-global-release-timings-revealed).

"Like the result of an experiment conducted in an underground Umbrella Corporation lab, Resident Evil Requiem successfully splices two separate strains of survival horror together into the one highly infectious new mutation," IGN wrote in our full [Resident Evil Requiem review](https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-review), which returned a 9/10 score.
