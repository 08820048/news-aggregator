[Magic: The Gathering](https://www.ign.com/games/magic-the-gathering-trading-card-game) is set to have another [big year in 2026](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-full-release-schedule-updated-2026), and there's already some excellent new deals to check out now that we've got a good chunk of this year's sets up for preorder.

My favorite deal in Amazon's latest MTG sale is on preorders for the [Marvel Super Heroes Play Booster Box](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gatherings-marvel-set-doesnt-launch-until-june-but-its-discounted-already), which is down to just [$189.99 is you order today](https://zdcs.link/QV58Z1?object_uuid=3e8bdab4-0b4c-4b4d-b60f-5ab22c875c7b&t=article).

That's $20 off the original list price, and with Amazon's preorder price guarantee, if the price drops further, you're certain to get the best price possible from now until release day in June.

However, that's not all. You can also find preorders for [Secrets of Strixhaven boosters](https://zdcs.link/zJ8pXq?object_uuid=3e8bdab4-0b4c-4b4d-b60f-5ab22c875c7b&t=article) down to $149.99 as well right now. That's another serious discount for some cards that aren't even out yet, and worth checking out if you haven't locked in your preorder yet. Just as a reminder as well, Amazon won't charge you for preorders until at dispatch closer to release day for [Marvel](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-marvel-super-heroes-tcg-where-to-buy), [Strixhaven](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-secrets-of-strixhaven-tcg-where-to-buy), and [TMNT](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-next-precon-deck-is-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtle-themed-and-its-already-discounted-just-a-few-weeks-from-launch).

Moving away from preorders, another notable set on sale is Bloomburrow's Play Booster Display, down to just [$142.99 at Amazon](https://zdcs.link/QPx7jA?object_uuid=3e8bdab4-0b4c-4b4d-b60f-5ab22c875c7b&t=article). That's an impressive price drop from its $203.99 list price, and a good example of its market price value falling [\-28.51% over the past few weeks](https://zdcs.link/QG81XW?object_uuid=3e8bdab4-0b4c-4b4d-b60f-5ab22c875c7b&t=article).

There's also some notable discounts on 2025 Universes Beyond sets, like Avatar: The Last Airbender, and Marvel's Spider-Man, at low, low prices right now as well. My favorite from this selection is on the [Avatar Beginner's Box](https://zdcs.link/91wXy3?object_uuid=3e8bdab4-0b4c-4b4d-b60f-5ab22c875c7b&t=article), which is down to just $23.13 at Amazon.

You can also score the Collectors versions of these Universes Beyond sets as well, both of which have seen tidy price drops since last year, and are your best bet of finding the rarest cards from each set.

[Play Boosters](https://zdcs.link/9l3ejx?object_uuid=3e8bdab4-0b4c-4b4d-b60f-5ab22c875c7b&t=article) are now the standard way to crack open Magic packs, having replaced both Set and Draft Boosters. But if you're on the hunt for rare cards, [Collector Boosters](https://zdcs.link/Qp7A2Y?object_uuid=3e8bdab4-0b4c-4b4d-b60f-5ab22c875c7b&t=article) are the best option.

These packs are more expensive, but are much more likely to include various foil treatments, extended arts, and all sorts. There are usually 5 Commons, 4 Uncommons, 5 Rare or Mythic Rare cards, a Land and a Token, but the rub here is that 6 of the included cards have a 'booster Fun frame' and 12-13 of them are foil.

In other TCG news, there are also some great deals on Pokémon cards right now at Amazon and TCGplayer, including a great deal on the most recent expansion's booster bundle, [Mega Evolution - Phantasmal Flames](https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-phantasmal-flames-booster-bundles-amazon-update-2026). It's down to its lowest price ever at Amazon.

ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)

### Booster Bundle (6 Booster Packs)

Unsurprisingly, stock is still running low on Amazon for a lot of Pokémon cards, even from last year, and even upcoming MTG sets like Marvel Super Heroes, Strixhaven, and TMNT.

That said, sites like [TCGplayer](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-edge-of-eternities-where-to-buy) still have a solid supply, and in some cases, better prices too, so are definitely worth checking out while on your hunt for cheap boosters.
