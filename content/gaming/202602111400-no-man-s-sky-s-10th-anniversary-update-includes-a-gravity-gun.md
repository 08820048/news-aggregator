2025 was a big year for [_No Man's Sky_](https://www.polygon.com/game/no-mans-sky/35726/)_,_ with updates adding [underground relics](https://www.polygon.com/news/546691/no-mans-sky-relics-update/), [Nintendo Switch 2 compatibility](https://www.polygon.com/news/603493/no-mans-sky-beacon-update-switch-2-compatibility/), and additional [ship customization](https://www.polygon.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-update-new-spaceships/) options. It seems that developer Hello Games' commitment to ongoing updates will continue into 2026 and beyond, as the studio just revealed the latest _No Man's Sky_ update, Remnant, which launches today. The Remnant update features several new additions to the game, including the ideal 10th anniversary present: a gravity gun.

"2026 represents 10 years since we launched and I couldn’t be prouder," lead designer Sean Murray [said in a post](https://www.nomanssky.com/remnant-update/) announcing the gravity-defying new update. "For any game to reach such a milestone is a privilege."

The Gravitino Coil is a new mod for the multi-tool, allowing players to pick up and carry (or throw) large objects. It can even be used as a weapon, turning heavy objects into deadly projectiles.

The Remnant update also features a new recycling mechanic, in which space debris that has always been lying (or floating) around the game can now be collected by players and recycled into valuable resources at Waste Processing Plants, though some debris is dangerous and must be transported carefully to avoid disaster.

To make hauling around volatile space junk a bit easier, players also have access to a vast new fleet of buildable vehicles that can be used to haul bulky resources from place to place. From multi-legged recon vehicles to flatbed haulers and armored tanks, players can customize these vehicles to their heart's content.

The Remnant update turns every pile of wreckage and derelict ship into an opportunity for resource acquisition (and gravity-related shenanigans). The new update also includes a limited-time community expedition in which players form convoys to clean up a planet covered in scrap and other [space waste](https://www.polygon.com/cards-against-humanity-elon-musk-lawsuit-spacex/), working together to salvage what they can. Rewards for completing the new expedition include new vehicle parts and a new armor set that Murray described as "beautifully crafted" with "ornate steampunk detailing."

"It wouldn’t be possible without your continued support and we genuinely appreciate it," Murray said of the Remnant update. "Our journey continues."
