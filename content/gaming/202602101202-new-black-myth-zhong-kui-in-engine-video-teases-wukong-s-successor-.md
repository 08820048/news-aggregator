To celebrate Chinese New Year and the upcoming Year of the Horse, [_Black Myth: Wukong_](https://www.polygon.com/review/440941/black-myth-wukong-review/) developer Game Science just dropped a six-minute cooking show. Besides teaching us how to make a tasty fish soup, the video also serves as an in-engine teaser for their next game: [_Black Myth: Zhong Kui_](https://www.polygon.com/black-myth-zhong-kui-gamescom-trailer/).

Following _Black Myth Wukong_'s release in 2024, _Black Myth: Zhong Kui_ will be the second installment in the Black Myth series. The first game [won multiple awards](https://www.polygon.com/awards/503715/black-myth-wukong-goty-steam-awards/), though, much to the developer's disappointment, [not the Game of the Year category](https://www.polygon.com/awards/497206/black-myth-wukong-goty-loss/) at The Game Awards. Like its predecessor, _Black Myth: Zhong Kui_ will be a single-player action RPG centered around a Chinese folkloric theme. This time, instead of the Monkey King, the protagonist is a famous Taoist deity and exorcist called Zhong Kui — the Ghost King.

With a profession like that, we'll likely encounter more than a few ghostly and demonic foes when _Black Myth: Zhong Kui_ arrives, though the Year of the Horse video doesn't reveal them yet. Instead, we see a woman chopping veggies and a possessed (but probably harmless) fish, while a man opens a large seashell to ask the seemingly friendly demon inside for a piece of googly-eyed meat.

The woman then continues to grab some chives from a sleeping demon-baby plant before brutally grinding a couple of red mini-demons to death and taking a fruit from a tree-man who casually strolls by. Demons aside, it's a very peaceful scene, right until the end… When the cook places her creation before a masked prisoner under the watchful eye of a guardian who may or may not be Zhong Kui — it's hard to tell in the dark.

Note that this _Black Myth: Zhong Kui_ video is described as "non-canon and for entertainment purposes only" by the developer, which means it's a showcase of graphics, setting, and atmosphere, more than a story reveal.

Although the man at the end of the video may not be Zhong Kui himself, we did get a good look at the Ghost King in [_Black Myth: Zhong Kui_'s reveal trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ7VLcO06Ak) from August 2025; he's the large, dark-skinned, bearded man riding a tiger. Neither video has yet revealed a release date for _Black Myth: Wukong_'s successor.
