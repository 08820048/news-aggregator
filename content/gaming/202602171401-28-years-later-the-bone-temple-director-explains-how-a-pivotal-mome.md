Check out an exclusive special feature from the movie's home release

[_28 Years Later: The Bone Temple_](https://www.polygon.com/28-year-later-bone-temple-review/) is a battle of good versus evil, with good represented by the kindhearted Dr. Ian Kelson (Ralph Fiennes) and evil epitomized by the murderous cult leader Sir Jimmy Crystal (Jack O’Connell). When the two men first meet, about an hour into the movie, it’s brutally tense… and surprisingly chummy. They seem to strike up a friendship, until Jimmy ruins it by threatening to murder Ian.

In a behind-the-scenes video from _The Bone Temple_’s home release, director Nia DaCosta talks about filming the scene, comparing it to the part of Michael Mann's classic crime thriller _Heat_ in which the two protagonists, played by Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, finally come face to face.

“It’s kind of like our Pacino/De Niro moment in _Heat_, but with more zombies,” DaCosta says.

Check out the full video above, which also includes interviews with Fiennes and O’Connell, exclusively on Polygon.
