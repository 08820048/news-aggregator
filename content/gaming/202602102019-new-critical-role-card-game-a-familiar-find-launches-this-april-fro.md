A new card game set in [_Critical Role_](https://www.polygon.com/critical-role/)'s world of Exandria transports players into the paws, claws, and tentacles of some of the franchise's most recognizable animal companions. [Darrington Press](https://www.polygon.com/dnd-dungeons-dragons/607177/critical-role-darrington-press-chris-perkins-jeremy-crawford-dnd-wizards/) announced Feb. 10 that _A Familiar Find_ will be released on April 7, 2026. Described as a "charming, fast-paced, and strategic card game," _A Familiar Find_ tasks 2 to 4 players to assume the role of familiars gathering rare spell ingredients for their respective powerful spellcasters.

The game includes 10 different characters with unique abilities, including fan favorites from _Critical Role_ campaigns like Trinket the Bear, Mister, and Pâté de Rolo. During a game that lasts between 30 and 40 minutes, the action revolves around a shared central card pile that’s constantly reshaped by Location Cards, while Arcane Cards allow players to bluff, set traps, and sabotage one another’s plans. The design aims to keep the experience approachable while still offering enough tactical depth to reward clever play and timing.

Darrington Press describes the game as "enchantingly lighthearted," and the art by John Ramsey and Svetlana Kucheryavenko definitely matches those vibes, looking like something closer to [_Root_](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22834334/root-the-roleplaying-game-review/) or _Magic: The Gathering_'s [_Bloomburrow_](https://www.polygon.com/24190201/mtg-bloomburrow-card-previews-new-mechanics/) set rather than what you'd typically expect of _Critical Role_ or its TTRPG [_Daggerheart_](https://www.polygon.com/critical-role/599974/daggerheart-review-critical-role-ttrpg-rules-overview/). The principal game designer on _A Familiar Find_ is Ian Zang, the man behind the award-winning _Constellations: The Game of Stargazing and the Night Sky_. It's the perfect opportunity for _Critical Role_ diehards seeking an excuse to dabble in the world of Exandria on game night.

_A Familiar Find_ will be available through Darrington Press Guild stores, Critical Role shops in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., the EU, and Australia, as well as friendly local game stores worldwide on April 7 for a suggested retail price of $29.99.
