Armchair detectives are going to have a field day with this week's free games on the Epic Games Store. For a limited time, two different mystery games will be made free, _Nobody Wants to Die_ and _The Darkside Detective: A Fumble in the Dark._

[_Nobody Wants to Die_](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/nobody-wants-to-die-fe21cd) is a noir murder mystery set in a futuristic, cyberpunk world. Citizens have become effectively immortal by virtue of being able to swap their consciousnesses between bodies. Detective James Karra is in pursuit of a serial killer who destroys the physical manifestations of their victims' consciousnesses, ensuring they stay dead. As Karra, you'll recreate crime scenes and piece together clues to deduce just who's behind these killings while tangling with the economic realities of an unequal future.

Epic's other free detective game also offers compelling mysteries, but with something of a lighter tone. [_The Darkside Detective: A Fumble in the Dark_](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/the-darkside-detective-a-fumble-in-the-dark-174fcf) is a comedic point-and-click, retro-styled detective game. You'll have nine supernatural cases to investigate in Twin Lakes (which is described as "America’s 34th most haunted city") as detective Francis McQueen. If _The Darkside Detective: A Fumble in the Dark_ sounds familiar, that might be because [Epic gave away the first game](https://www.polygon.com/free-game-on-pc-epic-games-store-dec-4-jackbox/) toward the end of last year. Similar to the first game, _A Fumble in the Dark_ includes a "mail-in rebate per customer on exorcism services for hauntings resulting from play," just in case any ghosts or demons show up during your detective work.

If you want to pick up _Nobody Wants to Die_ or _The Darkside Detective: A Fumble in the Dark_ for free, all you need to do is log in to the Epic Games Store and claim them. They'll be free until Thursday, Feb. 19 at 11 a.m. EST.

In February, Epic gave away [_Botany Manor_ and _Pixel Gun 3D_ DLC](https://www.polygon.com/epic-games-store-free-games-pc-february-5-botany-manor/).
