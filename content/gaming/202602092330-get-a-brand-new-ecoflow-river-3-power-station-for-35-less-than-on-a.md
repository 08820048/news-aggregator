It's never a bad idea to keep a power station on hand to keep your mobile electronics charged up during emergencies. If you're of the same mind and plan to look on Amazon, then you might want to check out this better deal from AliExpress.

Right now, AliExpress is offering the [Ecoflow River 3](https://zdcs.link/zE8qVJ?object_uuid=f7a10def-7639-4c6b-ba36-bc41c0cfa226&t=article) 230Wh LiFePO4 power station for just $130.84 after you apply $10 off code "**USSS10**". Compare that to [$190 on Amazon](https://zdcs.link/aoJ7O0?object_uuid=f7a10def-7639-4c6b-ba36-bc41c0cfa226&t=article) currently. It's sold through Ecoflow's official Aliexpress storefront and it ships from a local US warehouse so your order delivers quickly and you don't need to worry about additional tariff fees.

## Ecoflow River 3 Power Station for $130.84

The Ecoflow River 3 is a truly portable power station that weighs in at under 8 pounds and is 30% more compact than its River 2 precedessor. The AliExpress model has a slightly lower 230Wh capacity compared to the 245Wh on Amazon. Other than that, the two are identical; it has two 300W (600W surge) AC outlets, one 100W USB Type-C port, and two 18W USB Type-A ports. The River 3 can be recharged using traditional AC from 0% to 100% in only one hour.

The River 3 uses LiFePO4 cells, which are safer and retain their charge longer than other lithium battery types. The 230Whr battery is meant for lower powered electronics like your PC or laptop, phone, tablet, or just about anything else that doesn't use too much electricity (ideally under 200W). Power hungry electronics and appliances won't last long.

Although the River 3 is typically used as a mobile backup power solution when you have no available grid power, it can also work as an always-on passthrough AC power strip. It has an EPS function that will automatically swap to battery power when there is a power outage. The shutoff delay is less than 10ms, which is fast enough for even sensitive electronics like PCs to remain powered on during the switchover.

## More Powerful Alternative: Ecoflow River 2 Max Power Station

### Ecoflow River 2 Max 499Wh LiFePO4 Power Station

If you want a portable backup with a higher capacity, check out the [Ecoflow River 2 Max](https://zdcs.link/91wGb5?object_uuid=f7a10def-7639-4c6b-ba36-bc41c0cfa226&t=article), which is currently on sale for $234.35 after you apply code: "**USSS30**". The River 2 Max boasts a much higher 499Wh capacity with four AC outlets capable of 500W (1,000W surge) apiece. Like the River 3, this model also uses safe and more efficient LiFePO4 batteries. It weighs in at 13.5 pounds, so it's still easy to move from place to place, and comes with a 5 year warranty.
