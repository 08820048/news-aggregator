A new exclusive clip for Devil May Cry Season 2 has a couple of new characters it wants you to meet: Ebony and Ivory, Dante's trademark guns from the games. Devil May Cry Season 2 arrives on Netflix on May 12, 2026, and will see Dante once again at odds with his twin brother, Vergil.

"The interesting part is that Vergil’s a guy who can stand completely still and still feel like the most dangerous one in the room," [Adi Shankar](https://www.ign.com/articles/how-adi-shankar-went-from-netflixs-castlevania-to-captain-laserhawk-a-wild-remix-of-ubisoft-ip), the showrunner and executive producer of the animated series, told [Collider](https://collider.com/devil-may-cry-season-2-first-look-images-adi-shankar-what-to-expect-netflix-series/). "His presence does the talking."

Season 1 of the show focused on Dante's conflict with the terrorist White Rabbit and an impending apocalypse. Shankar promised Season 2 will continue to deliver plenty of surprises for fans. “I’m allergic to formula. I dislike when successful shows turn into comfort food," he said in the same Collider interview. "Devil May Cry won’t be TV that loops. My mission for Season 2 was to capture the feeling of a 2000s film franchise entry where the audience can’t predict the next turn.”

Johnny Yong Bosch will return as Dante, Robbie Daymond will lend his vocal cords to Vergil once again, while Scout Taylor-Compton is Lady, AKA Mary Ann Arkham.
