Amazon Game Studios is shutting down Glowmade's online multiplayer dungeon crawler King of Meat.

In a post on the [game's homepage](https://www.kingofmeat.com/en-us), Amazon announced servers will be shut down on April 9, 2026.

As of yesterday (February 23), King of Meat was delisted from all storefronts, and in-game purchases were disabled.

"Despite the creativity and innovation Glowmade brought to King of Meat, the game has unfortunately not found the audience we hoped for," the publisher wrote. "As a result, we have made the difficult decision to conclude our investment in the game."

Players who purchased King of Meat will receive a full refund "in the coming weeks from their platform provider." Refunds will be processed automatically between February 24 and April 9, 2026.

"We sincerely thank every player who supported King of Meat and the wonderful community that formed around it," said Amazon. "Your enthusiasm, imagination, and feedback have meant the world to us and to the team at Glowmade.

"We're grateful for Glowmade's partnership and passion throughout this journey and wish them continued success in the future."

King of Meat launched in October 2025. Two months after its release, the game reportedly "[failed to meet internal expectations by a significant margin](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/glowmade-reportedly-affected-by-layoffs)," leading to layoffs.

Glowmade was founded in 2015 by former Lionhead Studios developers. It [partnered with Amazon in 2021](https://www.amazongamestudios.com/en-us/news/articles/amazon-games-publishing-original-game-from-glowmade) as part of the firm's expansion into third-party publishing.

Speaking to _GamesIndustry.biz_ in 2024, Amazon Game Studios' former EMEA publishing director Jon Rosenblatt said King of Meat "was an [ideal opportunity to work with a very talented team in Guildford](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/amazons-widening-bet-on-games-were-not-hell-bent-on-just-being-mmos), and really grow that game out into something much bigger than maybe they \[had\] planned."

Last month, Amazon announced it [would be shutting down its MMO New World: Aeternum](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/amazon-games-new-world-aeternum-to-go-offline-in-january-2027). Servers will go offline on January 31, 2027.

Development of the game paused in October 2025, when it was announced there would be no further updates. This was part of [wider cuts to Amazon's infrastructure](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/amazon-to-shed-14000-jobs-to-be-organized-more-leanly-despite-acknowledging-it-is-performing-well), which affected 14,000 jobs.
