### Acer Predator Helios Neo 16" OLED Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX RTX 5070 Ti Gaming Laptop (64GB/2TB)

The Acer Predator Helios Neo is a mid to high-end laptop featuring powerful components at a no-nonsense price. Build quality and materials are good with an aluminum top lid and a plastic composite bottom chassis. The $1,550 configuration is equipped with an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU, Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti GPU, 32GB of DDR5-6400MHz RAM, and a 1TB SSD. The $1.900 configuration adds on double the RAM and SSD storage. The gorgeous 16" OLED display features a 2.5K 189ppi resolution, 0.2ms response time, 240Hz refresh rate, HDR 500 True Black certification, and 100% DCI-P3 color space. Connectivity options include both Thunderbolt 4 and HDMI 2.1 ports and an ethernet port.

### The Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX is a top performing CPU

The Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor has 24 cores and a max turbo frequency of 5.4GHz. This is the second most powerful Intel mobile CPU currently available (the Ultra 9 285HX has a slightly higher clock speed) and goes toe to toe with AMD's flagship Ryzen 9 9955HX processor. This is an excellent CPU to pair with a powerful GPU like the 5070 Ti.

### The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti mobile GPU can handle the most demanding games

The RTX 5070 Ti mobile GPU performs about 15%-20% better than the RTX 5070. Compared to the previous generation, it's comparable in performance to the RTX 4080 and pulls ahead of it in games that support [DLSS 4.5](https://www.ign.com/articles/dlss-4-explained-everything-you-need-to-know-about-nvidias-latest-ai-upscaling-tech) and multi-frame generation. It's powerful enough to run just about any game on the display's upgraded 2560x1600 resolution.
