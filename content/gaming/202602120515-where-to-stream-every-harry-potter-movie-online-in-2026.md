The Harry Potter franchise may have started as a [book series](https://www.ign.com/articles/harry-potter-books-in-order), but it quickly became one of the biggest entertainment franchises in the world. With a total of 11 movies, a Broadway play, and an upcoming TV series, there's seemingly no end in sight for the Potterverse.

**Every Harry Potter movie is currently available to stream with an** [**HBO Max subscription**](https://www.ign.com/wikis/hbo-max/Plans_and_Pricing). You can also watch all of the original eight films with a [Peacock subscription](https://www.ign.com/wikis/peacock/Plans_and_Pricing). Warner Bros. still holds the rights to the film franchise and will continue to do so unless a deal goes through. It's possible that if Netflix is [actually able to acquire](https://www.ign.com/articles/netflix-announces-827-billion-deal-to-acquire-warner-bros-and-commits-to-continued-theatrical-releases-for-studios-films) Warner Bros. that you'll eventually be able to watch Harry Potter on Netflix, but for now it's still just HBO and Peacock.

Outside of HBO Max, you can also rent or purchase all of the films from VOD platforms like Prime Video and Apple TV. Here's the full breakdown of how to watch the Harry Potter movies online in 2026:

## How to Stream Harry Potter Movies for Free

[![Walmart+ Membership](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/06/walmart-1759757062856.png?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/DZLlw?object_uuid=47a69701-af00-468a-9736-7729af676dfc&t=article "Walmart+ Membership")

### Walmart+ Membership

Free trial available.

There aren't any free streaming services that are currently offering the [Harry Potter movies](https://www.ign.com/articles/harry-potter-movies-in-order), but that doesn't mean it's impossible to watch them for free legally. Neither HBO Max or Peacock have free trials available, but you can actually get a Peacock Premium subscription through Walmart+. There's a [30-day Walmart+ free trial available](https://www.ign.com/wikis/walmart-plus/Free_Trial) for new subscribers, which includes either Peacock Premium or Paramount+. This will only get you access to the original eight movies as the Fantastic Beasts films are only available on HBO Max.

## 4K Blu-ray Collection

4K UHD

### Harry Potter (8-Film Collection)

If you'd prefer to actually own the Harry Potter movies, there's a 4K UHD Blu-ray collection currently available that includes all eight of the original movies in a nice little package. You do need a [4K capable Blu-ray player](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-blu-ray-players) to actually watch these discs, but you'll no longer be reliant on streaming services to watch them. You can stream them in [4K on HBO Max](https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-stream-max-in-4k), but that level of resolution is only available to those with the highest tier subscription.
