I treat sales like a stress test for taste. When prices drop this hard, it becomes very easy to buy things you will never actually play, and much harder to spot the ones that'll genuinely earn your time / attention / love. Let's remove the guesswork. I've already put hours into these games, and this list comes from experience rather than impulse. Every one is worth a run (_Gotham Knights_ maybe less so.)

## **This Day in Gaming 🎂**

Today I’m celebrating the 26th birthday of **The Sims**. When this launched, I must confess that my first thought was, “Well, this is barely a game right here.” The Sims seemed more like a virtual fish tank that was only fun if I kept concocting new (and worryingly sociopathic) ways to torment the virtual peoples in my employ. Though this game and genre didn’t flick my switch straight away, personally, the lights clicked on and stayed burning bright for the many, many more of you. After 15 years this original sold a whopping 11.24M copies, so it absolutely deserves a place of honour in the PC gaming pantheon.

Sometimes people can feel cold when they're wearing lots of blue. It's all psychomological.

-   [EA Sports FC 26](https://www.amazon.com.au/SPORTS-Standard-Switch-VideoGame-English/dp/B0FGKXSW6K?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-49%) **A$46** A familiar rhythm with small but meaningful tweaks, still best enjoyed in short bursts, and still prone to menu friction once you dig too deep.
-   [Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled](https://www.amazon.com.au/Crash-Team-Racing-Nitro-Fueled/dp/B07L43F2T6?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-35%) **A$45.30** Still brutally honest about skill gaps, still secretly mean, and still one of the sharpest kart racers once nostalgia wears off.
-   [Lunar Remastered Col.](https://www.amazon.com.au/LUNAR-Remastered-Collection/dp/B0DTKHT2ST?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-22%) **A$58.10** A warm, earnest JRPG throwback that shows its age, but rewards patience with charm modern games rarely attempt.
-   [Borderlands 3 Ult. Ed.](https://www.amazon.com.au/Borderlands-3-Ultimate-Edition/dp/B0CH1D6YCW?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-52%) **A$43.10** The writing still divides, but the gunplay finally carries the whole experience once everything is bundled.
-   [TowerFall](https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000012887) (-75%) **A$7.50** Pure couch multiplayer tension, instantly readable, endlessly replayable, and capable of ending friendships in under five minutes.

Or gift a [**Nintendo eShop Card**](https://zdcs.link/V0MbJ?object_uuid=ede86b6b-6153-4cf3-b3a9-26b14ecfbbea&t=article).

-   [Resident Evil 4](https://www.amazon.com.au/Resident-Evil-4/dp/B0BJTSN9ZC?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-49%) **A$30.50** Still impeccably paced, still confident in its redesigns, and still terrifying without relying on cheap tricks.
-   [Gotham Knights](https://www.amazon.com.au/Gotham-Knights/dp/B0BK5KX4PG?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-70%) **A$32.50** Messy systems and repetition remain, but the co-op and city vibe land better once expectations are lowered.

-   [No More Heroes 3](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/p/no-more-heroes-3/9MTT1TCW9TGL/0010) (-90%) **A$7.40** Stylish, scrappy, and knowingly uneven, but Suda51’s personality carries it through every rough edge.
-   [Dead Cells](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/p/dead-cells/BQSCNS1T8PHQ/0001) (-50%) **A$16.70** Still one of the cleanest action loops around, still punishing, and still impossible to play just once.

Routine sheathing or some impromptu seppuku? You decide.

-   [Ghost of Yotei](https://www.amazon.com.au/Ghost-of-Yotei/dp/B0F73KKLZN?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-21%) **A$99** Visually striking and contemplative, but deliberately slow, asking patience before it truly opens up.
-   [Star Wars Outlaws](https://www.amazon.com.au/Star-Wars-Outlaws/dp/B0D16YJ8XY?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-68%) **A$34.90** Ambitious and uneven, but nails the fantasy of being a small time operator in a huge galaxy.
-   [Unicorn Overlord](https://www.amazon.com.au/Unicorn-Overlord/dp/B0CK271HFX?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-40%) **A$57.20** Deep tactics wrapped in lavish art, surprisingly approachable, though commitment is non negotiable.
-   [Hitman World of Assassination](https://www.amazon.com.au/HITMAN-World-of-Assassination/dp/B0CBVX15N5?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-48%) **A$54.60** A masterclass in player freedom, endlessly replayable, and still unmatched in systemic stealth design.

**PS4**

-   [Assassin's Creed Mirage](https://www.amazon.com.au/Assassins-Creed-Mirage/dp/B0BDR9W7MB?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-63%) **A$29.90** A tighter, quieter Assassin’s Creed that trades scale for focus, mostly to its benefit.
-   [Mortal Kombat 11 Ult.](https://www.amazon.com.au/Mortal-Kombat-11-Ultimate/dp/B098RGD192?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-55%) **A$40.20** Content rich and mechanically solid, though its grind still overstays its welcome.

Or purchase a [**PS Store Card.**](https://zdcs.link/kn6Ww?object_uuid=ede86b6b-6153-4cf3-b3a9-26b14ecfbbea&t=article)

## Purchase Cheap for PC

-   [Black Myth Wukong](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black_Myth_Wukong/) (-25%) **A$67.40** Visually stunning and occasionally punishing, with combat that demands precision more than flair.
-   [Mortal Kombat Elder God Bndl](https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/61068/Mortal_Kombat_Elder_God_Bundle/) (-84%) **A$19.90** An absurd amount of content for the price, though learning curves remain unforgiving.
