Find your way in Valley IV

Our [**_Arknights: Endfield_**](https://www.polygon.com/arknights-endfield/) **Valley IV interactive map** is the perfect tool to find your way in the multilayered areas within the region. From the Hub and the Valley Pass to the Aburrey Quarry, there is always a new spot to explore. In general, all these locations have been affected by Endfield Industries's human-made complex networks of wires and towers, yet still showing the wonders of living organisms and the traces of geological changes.

Because the areas in Valley IV can be a bit confusing to navigate, an interactive map of each region is useful when searching for the many materials you will need. There are **Rare Growth** spots, where you can collect materials, or **Mineral Beds**, where you can place **Portable Originium Rigs**. To improve your facilities, you also have to find all the **Protocol Datallogers** and **Auryeles** scattered across the map.

Spend some time walking around, and you will definitely find **Electric Nexuses** to power facilities. You may stumble upon **Recycling Stations** to collect some items, and **Protocol Spaces** to farm the materials you use to level up your characters. And let's not forget about **TP Points**, structures you need not only to navigate the large areas but also to rest and recover your character's health after combat.

Below, you can find our **interactive** **_Arknights: Endfield map_** with all the key elements you want to keep track of while playing the game.
