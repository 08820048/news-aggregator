Here's almost seven minutes of Black Myth: Wukong follow-up [Black Myth: Zhong Kui](https://www.ign.com/games/black-myth-zhong-kui). Well, kind of.

While developer Game Science has dropped the new in-engine trailer and labelled it as pertaining to the highly-anticipated sequel, it also features a "non-canon" disclaimer which suggests everything you see here could have no bearing whatsoever on the final game or its story, and has only been released by the team to celebrate Chinese New Year and welcome in the Year of the Horse.

But while you won't see any gameplay or combat per se, the "non-canon, for entertainment purposes only" trailer nonetheless shows in-engine footage and gives us our best look yet at what to expect from the sequel, particularly in terms of how it looks and sounds. Let me take you through it.

It starts out normally enough as a young woman moves around an al fresco kitchen preparing a meal. Look a little closer, though, and you'll realize that the figure that passes her near the beginning isn't _quite_ human, and the guy who opens the gigantic oyster-stroke-mussell shell reveals not a mollusc but, well, a little grey-faced man, uh, thing. She then prepares a slab of meat with blinking eyeballs embedded in it.

There's more — much more — but it's such a delight, I'd recommend watching it yourself. Just remember that it's more of a tech demo and is unlikely to impact the eventual storyline of Black Myth: Zhong Kui, much like the spin-off story Game Science similarly [released at Chinese New Year last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_qVHZMo2ls).

[Black Myth: Wukong](https://www.ign.com/games/black-myth-wukong) developer Game Science revealed sequel Black Myth: Zhong Kui at [Opening Night Live 2025 last August.](https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-developer-game-science-announces-sequel-black-myth-zhong-kui) "Set against the backdrop of the classic Chinese folktale 'Zhong Kui Banishing Evil,' Black Myth: Zhong Kui is a single-player action role-playing game rooted in ancient Chinese fantasy," GameScience said.

"The game will deliver distinctive experiences and gameplay features that push our limits, while also bringing fresh ideas and necessary changes to address past flaws and regrets." As yet, there's no release window, let alone a firm date.

Predecessor Black Myth: Wukong is the record-breaking action game that launched across PC and PlayStation 5 in 2024, selling 10 million copies in just three days. The Xbox Series X and S versions launched in August 2025. It returned a Great 8/10 in [IGN's Black Myth: Wukong review](https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-review-pc), in which we wrote: "Despite some frustrating technical issues, Black Myth: Wukong is a great action game with fantastic combat, exciting bosses, tantalizing secrets, and a beautiful world."
