summary: "Here are the three Resident Evil games you need play before starting Resident Evil 9, Capcom's new entry to the survival horror series."
---
It's clear that [_Resident Evil Requiem_](https://www.polygon.com/resident-evil-requiem/), the next entry in Capcom's long-running series of horror games, will heavily build on its 30-year history. [Leon S. Kennedy is coming in hotter](https://www.polygon.com/women-of-capcom-made-leon-kennedy-hot-resident-evil-9/) than ever to kick zombie ass (all while hitting his Porsche-driving midlife crisis). Grace Ashcroft bridges the gap between _Requiem_ and a 2003 Resident Evil game that, despite its loyal fan base, is rarely remembered by the mainstream. And after years away, we'll once again revisit Raccoon City, the place where it all began.

If you haven't been playing Resident Evil games over the last 30 years, catching up with the series now would be a Herculean task — especially considering _Requiem_ is just a few weeks away. If you want to at least begin the next big game with a solid grasp of key elements and characters appearing in _Requiem_, these are the three Resident Evil games you must play.

**Where to play:** Android, iOS, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and Series X, and Windows PC

Even before receiving the remake treatment, [_Resident Evil 2_](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/1/22/18192509/resident-evil-2-remake-review/) was an important entry in the series. This game tells two different stories, depending on the route you choose to play. In one, you play as Leon S. Kennedy, who is about to start his career as a rookie in the Raccoon City Police Department. The second route focuses on Claire Redfield, a teenage girl who happens to be going to Raccoon City to visit her brother, Chris.

While the routes converge at some points, they are complementary, making it necessary to play both to fully understand the events in the game. (In the PSOne era, this meant that _Resident Evil 2_ shipped on two CDs. We all know that, back then, all the cool games spanned more than one disk.) This game is essential to anyone interested in playing _Requiem_ for one key reason: It introduces Leon, who has a major role in the new game. It's fascinating to see Leon's origin in the series and the event that shaped him into the grizzled hero he is today. However, Leon is not the only reason why you want to play _Resident Evil 2_ before _Requiem_.

Although it's the second game in the series, _Resident Evil 2_ is the first one set in the streets of Raccoon City, where you'll visit important landmarks that you'll likely revisit in _Requiem_, such as the R.P.D. station. That's not all that may reappear in _Requiem_. In Claire's route, she saves a young girl named Sherry Birkin, who's all by herself in the city, which has been overrun by zombies. Since this is a Resident Evil game, Sherry is also connected to Umbrella. After analyzing the last _Requiem_ trailer, YouTuber [The Sphere Hunter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMYYTuof0NU) posits that the dispatcher talking to Leon may actually _be_ Sherry. If true, another piece of the second game will be a big part of _Resident Evil Requiem_'s story.

## Resident Evil 3: Nemesis

**Where to play:** Android, iOS, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and Series X, and Windows PC

At the center of [_Resident Evil 3: Nemesis_](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/3/30/21199436/resident-evil-3-remake-review-playstation-4-xbox-one-pc/) is Jill Valentine, one of the protagonists from the first game in the series. After escaping window-breaking zombie dogs and a giant hellish plant, Jill is back in Raccoon City. The place is pure chaos because of an outbreak of the T-Virus, which transformed most of the city into zombies. If surviving mindless walking undeads wasn't enough, Jill has a new, bazooka-wielding challenge to face: Nemesis.

Created by Umbrella — what a surprise! — Nemesis is the result of mixing a humanoid biological weapon with a parasite and its only goal is to hunt S.T.A.R.S members, the task force Jill is part of.

There are a lot of fights and puzzles in _Resident Evil 3_, but most of the time Jill is on the run, trying to find her way through the maze-like layout of Raccoon City while escaping from Nemesis's unstoppable pursuit. By forcing Jill to be in constant movement, _Resident Evil 3_ works as a perfect tour guide that will show you some important spots in the city. Jill visits classic locations like the R.P.D. station — the same from _Resident Evil 2_ — and some never seen before, like Raccoon General Hospital, all while she passes through streets marked by destruction. In addition, after completing this game, you'll understand why Raccoon City has been reduced to a massive crater in _Resident Evil Requiem_.

Raccoon City becomes as much a character as Jill and Nemesis, and the more you play the third game, the more familiar its alleys and buildings become. _Resident Evil 3_ gives you the chance to intimately explore this city that became a landmark destination in gaming and pop culture — one that now returns in _Resident Evil Requiem_.

## Resident Evil Outbreak

**Where to play:** PlayStation 2 (or watch a Let's Play on YouTube!)

Released in 2003 in Japan and only hitting the West in 2004, [_Resident Evil Outbreak_](https://www.polygon.com/resident-evil-requiem-re9-prequels-outbreak-alyssa-ashcroft/) was kind of a big deal. For the first time, Capcom delivered a cooperative multiplayer Resident Evil experience with online features, exploring mechanics and systems that were new at the time. I remember being genuinely impressed by what I read about the game in old gaming magazines. I mean, playing online with friends? Wow! That was the future!

_Outbreak_ was the first Resident Evil made for the PlayStation 2, and it featured a completely different premise from the previous entries in the series. The game offers eight playable characters for you to choose from to complete its campaign. The idea was for players to form a team and play online to play through missions. Unlike earlier games, characters in _Outbreak_ aren't made of traditional hero material like Leon or Jill. Instead, the focus is on showing ordinary people — a waitress, a cop, or a journalist, for example — reacting to the hell unfolding in the form of zombies that overtook Raccoon City. Divided into small scenarios, the game tells episodic stories that take place around the same time as _Resident Evil 2_ and _Resident Evil 3_.

The connection between _Resident Evil Outbreak_ and _Requiem_ goes beyond Raccoon City and you can only fully experience it by playing _Resident Evil Outbreak: File #2_, an expanded version released by Capcom one year after the original game. It's basically the same game with more context.

One of the eight characters in _Outbreak_ is Alyssa Ashcroft, a journalist who — besides being the best lockpicker in the game — had been in contact with Umbrella's projects long before the T-Virus outbreak occurred, something we only learn in _File #2_. Five years before Raccoon City's downfall, Alyssa witnessed a strange creature — it was a zombie, by the way! — violently murder her friend Kurt. If that weren't traumatic enough, her memories of these events were suppressed by Greg Mueller, an Umbrella researcher.

While you will need to play _Outbreak_ to learn exactly what happens to Alyssa and the other seven characters, the only important fact you _need_ to know is that she survived. In fact, she lived long enough that she appears to be still working as a journalist in _Resident Evil Requiem_. She's also a mother, and her daughter is... Grace Ashcroft! Yes, the other protagonist in _Requiem_. Because of this direct connection, we may see Grace uncovering more of her mother's secrets, along with whatever else is happening in _Resident Evil Requiem_.
