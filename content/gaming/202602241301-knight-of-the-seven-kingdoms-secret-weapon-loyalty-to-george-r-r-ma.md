Something Game of Thrones used to do until it couldn't anymore

## A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms succeeds because it had George R.R. Martin's road map

Season 1 of HBO’s [_A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms_](https://www.polygon.com/is-dunk-a-knight-in-seven-kingdoms-explainer/) season 1 has concluded, and it was a huge success. The series launch was one of HBO’s [top three most-watched premieres of all time](https://deadline.com/2026/01/a-knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-premiere-ratings-hbo-1236693486/). The show boasts one of the [highest IMDB-rated episodes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2026/02/09/a-knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-episode-4-sets-an-imdb-score-record/) of any series in the [Game of Thrones](https://www.polygon.com/game-of-thrones/) franchise. It also has something its predecessors didn’t: a fully completed story to adapt. That’s likely no coincidence when it comes to explaining why it's landed so well with critics and viewers.

_Game of Thrones_ outpaced [George R.R. Martin’s unfinished novels](https://www.polygon.com/george-rr-martin-best-book-what-to-read/), while [_House of the Dragon_](https://www.polygon.com/hbo-max-house-of-the-dragon-season-3-knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms/) draws from a fictional history book rather than a traditionally structured narrative. By contrast, _The Hedge Knight_ — the first of the Dunk and Egg novellas — is part of a trio of completed stories with a built-in fanbase and a clear narrative arc. The road map is already there. The characters have defined trajectories. The audience knows the destination.

Without the risk of overtaking the source material or inventing a late-game pivot that could derail the story, season 1 of _The Knight of the Seven Kingdoms_ benefits from clarity and cohesion. No one, not even the audience, was going to be blindsided by abrupt turns reminiscent of _Game of Thrones_ season 8. That stability gives the season confidence and thematic unity that the other two Game of Thrones shows lack.

_Game of Thrones_’ ending wasn’t inherently bad; it was [the rushed, uneven path leading to it](https://www.polygon.com/knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-stories-game-of-thrones-ending/) that made it feel unsatisfying. Many fans could agree on where most of the major characters ultimately landed (Bran aside, in my opinion), largely because readers had been [theorizing about those outcomes](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/28wlcn/spoilers_all_preacok_theories/) since Martin’s _A Dance with Dragons_ was published in 2011. The series concluded in a place the fandom had already headcanoned for years before it finally played out on-screen.

But the lack of source material to guide the journey was a clear issue. Once the show moved beyond Martin’s published work, showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss had to chart their own course to those endgames, and that’s where the execution faltered.

Meanwhile, Martin himself has had issues with [_House of the Dragon_’s adaptation](https://www.polygon.com/house-of-the-dragon-season-3-trailer/) of _Fire & Blood_, stating “everything wrong” with the HBO series in a now-deleted [blog post](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/george-r-r-martin-house-of-the-dragon-problems-1235991254/). Showrunner Ryan Condal [responded](https://ew.com/house-of-the-dragon-ryan-condal-responds-george-r-r-martin-blog-season-3-new-casting-exclusive-11704545) to the post, noting that Martin’s criticism “was disappointing.” He also explained why some changes were necessary for the adaptation, since _Fire & Blood_ isn’t a traditional narrative. “It’s this incomplete history, and it requires a lot of joining of the dots and a lot of invention as you go along the way,” he said.

Rather than unfolding as a traditional novel, _Fire & Blood_ is structured as an in-universe historical account of the Targaryen dynasty, written by a scholar within the world of _A Song of Ice and Fire_. Because it isn’t a traditional narrative, liberties had to be taken in its adaptation, which yielded [mixed results](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/house-of-the-dragon-reviews-1235201884/).

We’re no strangers to comparing the [_Game of Thrones_ universe to _Star Wars_](https://www.polygon.com/knight-of-seven-kingdoms-vs-the-mandalorian-grogu/), and a key reason is how each handles its source material. Since Disney acquired Lucasfilm, the studio has tended to [cherry-pick](https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2020/11/27/21722488/the-mandalorian-admiral-thrawn-explained-star-wars-ezra-bridger/) [highlights](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Legends_elements_in_the_films) from the now-non-canonical Expanded Universe rather than fully adapt its stories. As a result, the franchise now feels scattered. Lucasfilm is currently looking to course-correct by bringing [a popular Disney Plus show to theaters](https://www.polygon.com/the-mandalorian-grogu-movie-full-trailer/) — a show with no real connection to the larger Star Wars universe.

_Game of Thrones_ was never better than its first four seasons, when it was accurately adapting Marin’s novels. _A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms_ is a return to form in terms of faithful adaptations. (At least [for the most part](https://www.polygon.com/knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-finale-analysis-george-rr-martin/).) For the next two seasons, at least, the series has a clear road with no detours in sight, with two more published Martin novellas to adapt, each of them telling a complete, resolved story.

Past that, the future is less clear. Showrunner Ira Parker has [laid out an ambitious plan to work closely with Martin](https://www.polygon.com/knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-season-2-showrunner-interview/) on further seasons, and Martin [continues to claim](https://www.polygon.com/george-rr-martin-new-dunk-and-egg-novellas-deadline-history/) he’ll write more Dunk and Egg stories in the near future. Whether those stories materialize remains to be seen. But unless the creative team maps out a long-term plan, they risk landing this latest celebrated wing of the franchise in the same position as the other two.
