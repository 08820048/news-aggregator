Just last week Amazon [launched preorders](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-fallout-season-2-4k-steelbook-is-already-up-for-preorder-on-amazon) for the Fallout Season 2 4K Steelbook, but on the cover was a giant white box saying "Artwork and Product Details Not Final." The underlying cover was later revealed to be the standard 4K cover, which didn't become available to preorder until earlier this week. Now, more than a week after preorders first went live, Amazon has officially revealed what the steelbook cover actually looks like.

## Fallout Season 2 Steelbook Cover Revealed

Release Date TBD

### Fallout: Complete Second Season (4K UHD Amazon Exclusive Steelbook)

The new cover features Dogmeat, Lucy, The Ghoul, and Maximus in his Power Armor, all walking through the desert with a giant cloud overhead that looks to be in the shape of a [Deachlaw](https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-2-finally-gives-fans-game-accurate-live-action-deathclaws-thanks-to-five-puppeteers-and-ilm). In the background we get a small glimpse of New Vegas. It's a rather minimalistic approach that captures a lot of key elements of season 2, but I can't help but wish they would have gone with the older teased cover instead. You can still buy that version with the standard 4K edition, but it doesn't come with the steelbook case (and presumably additional goodies). Here's a quick side-by-side between the two covers:

Although we now have a finalized cover for the steelbook, we still don't have [any sort of release date](https://www.ign.com/wikis/fallout-tv-series/4K_Blu-ray_Releases) confirmed. We also still don't have any details about what bonus features or extras come with the steelbook. If the rollout of Fallout Season 1's steelbook is any indication of when we can expect season 2, we're likely looking at a May 2026 release date for these. Amazon followed a totally different [release schedule for season 2 episodes](https://www.ign.com/wikis/fallout-tv-series/Season_2_Episodes) this year, however, so it's possible they'll push the physical edition even further back than last time.

As of right now, the steelbook is available for $47.99 and the standard 4K edition is $34.99. There are also DVD and Blu-ray editions now available to preorder as well.
