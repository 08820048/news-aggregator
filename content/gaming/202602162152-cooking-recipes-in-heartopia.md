To make money in _[Heartopia](https://www.polygon.com/heartopia/)_,​​ ​​​​​​you'll want to​​ cook a ton of food and level up the **cooking hobby**. To do this, you'll want to buy **recipes** from Massimo, but there are a few "secret" recipes that you'll need to swap out ingredients for.

If you're looking to fill out your "gourmet life" collection, we've got your back. Here's an explanation on how cooking works in _Heartopia_ and a list of all the cooking recipes we've unlocked so far.

## How cooking works in Heartopia

Cooking is one of the many hobbies you can level up in _Heartopia_. As you level up, you'll unlock more recipes, which you can buy from Massimo.

To cook, you'll need to **interact with any stove furniture**, whether it's one in a public area, one in your house, or one in a stranger's house. From there, you'll just need to pick a recipe and wait for your item to cook, making sure to click or tap the spatula icon when it says you need to adjust the heat. Some of the more complex recipes will require you to adjust the heat many times, so you'll need to pay close attention while cooking.

There are a few recipes that have **variations**, like the jam recipes. If you just use the ingredients presented as the default options, you'll get "mixed jam," but if you manually set all four of the ingredients to blueberries, you'll get "blueberry jam" instead. You'll only need the "mixed jam" recipe unlocked to substitute in the other fruit options, so keep your eye out for these alternative recipes as you cook.

You'll mostly want to **sell your creations to Albert Jr. for gold**, but you can also eat your food to regain energy. That being said, we recommend only eating cheaper and easier-to-make foods, like house salads.

As you level up, you'll be able to cook higher-quality meals, the cooking minigame will get easier, and you'll have an increased chance of consuming no ingredients when you cook a dish. As of writing this, there are 13 levels in the cooking hobby.

## List of cooking recipes in Heartopia

Note that there are recipes that you may unlock early, but you'll need to level up other hobbies to get the ingredients for them. You'll want to level up fishing and gardening alongside cooking to get access to specific fish and crops needed for some recipes.

Below, you can see a list of the different cooking recipes available in _Heartopia_. We're still working on unlocking more recipes (we're level 9 at the moment), and we'll update this guide with more recipes as we unlock and confirm them.

Our list does not include the limited-time event recipes, such as the ones that are part of the Winter Frost season.
