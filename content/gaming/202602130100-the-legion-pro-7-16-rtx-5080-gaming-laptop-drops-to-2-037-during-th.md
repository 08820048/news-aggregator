## Lenovo Legion Pro 7 Gen 10 RTX 5080 Laptop for $2,037

### Lenovo Legion Pro 7 Gen 10 16" OLED Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX RTX 5080 Gaming Laptop (32GB/1TB)

Also use code "BUYMORELENOVO"

The Legion Pro 7 is Lenovo's highest end 16" gaming laptop, featuring a full metal chassis (both lid and body), gorgeous OLED display with 2.5K 189ppi resolution, 240Hz refresh rate, HDR 1000 True Black certification, and 100% DCI-P3 color range, and better cooling than the Legion 5 series of laptops. This particular configuration is equipped with a 16" 2560x1600 240Hz OLED display, Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU, Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 GPU, 32GB of DDR5-6400MHz RAM, and a 1TB SSD. This 2025 model has been updated with Wi-Fi 7. Connectivity options include a Thunderbolt 4 port with DisplayPort 2.1, a USB Type-C port with up to 100W of Power Delivery, three USB Type-A ports, an RJ45 ethernet port, and an HDMI 2.1 port. The 99Whr battery can charge to 70% in just 30 minutes.

### The Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX is a top performing CPU

The Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor has 24 cores and a max turbo frequency of 5.4GHz. This is the second most powerful Intel mobile CPU currently available (the Ultra 9 285HX has a slightly higher clock speed) and goes toe to toe with AMD's flagship Ryzen 9 9955HX processor. This is an excellent CPU to pair with a powerful GPU like the 5080.

### The GeForce RTX 5080 mobile GPU is better than the RTX 4090 mobile

The Legion Pro 7 laptop offers a robust cooling design that allows it to accomodate a more powerful GPU like the RTX 5080 without throttling it. That's important if you want to be able to play games comfortably on the display's enhanced 2560x1600 resolution. The RTX 5080 mobile GPU is roughly 15%-20% more powerful than the RTX 4080 mobile GPU that it replaces. In fact, it's slightly more powerful than the RTX 4090, which was the previous generation's flagship card. You should be able to run any game out there at consistent 60+ fps framerates.
