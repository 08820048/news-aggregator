[A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms](https://www.ign.com/tv/a-knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms) actor Peter Claffey, who plays Dunk, has been forced to clarify comments made by his young co-star which fans took as confirmation that The Witcher and Superman star Henry Cavill had secretly joined the series' cast.

Writing on Instagram, Claffey said that the apparent tease by Egg actor Dex Sol Ansell "had nothing to do with Henry Cavill coming into the show or the GOT universe (I wish!)" and that the whole thing had been a "complete misunderstanding."

The alleged slip-up happened during a filmed interview with the pair in which Claffey can be seen asking permission to discuss comparisons between the show and The Witcher, before his co-star then asks if he can mention something specific about Henry Cavill.

It takes a moment before Claffey seems to understand exactly what Sol Ansell is referring to, before he hurriedly replies: "No, no no no, god, no no no, don't say that," before he turns to the interviewer and says: "Sorry, you didn't hear that." You can watch the moment via the embed just above.

A Song of Ice and Fire fans had spent the weekend discussing the seemingly-confirmed fact that Cavill was joining the show, with many pointing to him playing the role of Daemon Blackfyre. Alas, that is seemingly not the case — unless is this deflection from Claffey. You would think, however, that Cavill was too busy right now to join, with work on Highlander ongoing and his plans to make Warhammer movies still in the offing.

Of course, all of this comes just days after Sol Ansell dropped an even bigger Knight of the Seven Kingdoms spoiler — for real this time. In a separate interview, [he discussed story detail told to him by Game of Thrones star George R.R. Martin regarding the ultimate fate of the series' stars](https://www.ign.com/articles/a-knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-young-star-reveals-huge-spoiler-for-what-happens-at-summerhall-as-told-to-him-by-george-rr-martin) — and potentially the finale of the whole show. As he revealed this information, Claffey can be seen making frantic gestures, before he tries to play down what has just been said.
