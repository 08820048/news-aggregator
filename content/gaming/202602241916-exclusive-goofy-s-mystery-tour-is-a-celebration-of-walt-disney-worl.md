summary: "When I talk to people about Disney Parks, I always tell them the true Disney Magic isn't found in the attractions, fireworks, or shows, but in the incredible Cast Members (aka employees) who bring them all to life. This is why I was so excited and honored to be invited to the Cast Member-exclusive event at Walt Disney World known as Goofy's Mystery Tour, which is a night filled with trivia, puzzles, challenges, camaraderie, and so much more that celebrates the amazing people who have dedicated their lives to making sure every guest has a dream-come-true vacation."

When I talk to people about Disney Parks, I always tell them the true Disney Magic isn't found in the attractions, fireworks, or shows, but in the incredible Cast Members (aka employees) who bring them all to life. This is why I was so excited and honored to be invited to the Cast Member-exclusive event at Walt Disney World known as Goofy's Mystery Tour, which is a night filled with trivia, puzzles, challenges, camaraderie, and so much more that celebrates the amazing people who have dedicated their lives to making sure every guest has a dream-come-true vacation.

This after-hours event at Animal Kingdom has been running at Walt Disney World for over 30 years and was inspired by a similar one at Disneyland known as Minnie's Moonlit Madness. During this fun-filled evening that always takes on a special theme - this year's was Goofy's Mystiki Tour - 300 teams of four compete for bragging rights and a pretty cool plaque, but this was so much more than just a game.

"I think for me it's mainly about getting to reconnect with my friends," Claire Embil from Walt Disney World Communications told me. "We don't always get to work with each other anymore, but this gives us a chance to come back together, and it kind of levels all of us out and gives us a reset as well. Whether you are in the parks, a resort, an office, backstage, or on stage, we all get to compete as one team together.

"The other really exciting thing is that we're invited to bring one of our family or friends with us as a fourth teammate, and I got to bring my Mom. That's my favorite thing about this event, which is by Cast Members and for Cast Members, but it's also for the people that made magic for us in our lives, and for me, that's my Mom."

I can very much relate to this because the reason I was invited to this event and that I'm writing this article right now is because of my Mom, who is my biggest supporter and has always been there for me. So, hearing Claire share that story was so meaningful and gave the whole night a different perspective for me. Speaking of Claire's mom, I also had the chance to speak to her, and her answers were just as moving.

Claire's Mom, Janet, lives in Chicago, but she's traveled down for the last three years to compete with her daughter, whom she lovingly called "one of the most magical Cast Members."

"I don't think I ever could have imagined that I'd be standing here today when I first brought Claire to Walt Disney World when she was four," Janet said. "I remember the day when we were leaving, and I have this picture of her with such a sad face because she had to go home, and I never thought one day she'd be working here. It's just so fun to get to see her and all the Cast Members that she's met along the way be celebrated like this. I think that you so often see Cast Members make magic for other people, and this is a chance for the company to make magic for them and say thank you and that this night is for you."

And what a night it was! You could literally feel the competitive spirit on display during Goofy's Mystiki Tour, and I especially loved those teams that dressed the part, including one quartet who dressed up as the birds from Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room. That level of spirit was needed, as these challenges were _tough._

Let's start with the questions. There were 75 multiple choice questions that the teams had to solve, and they really test the knowledge of even the most seasoned Disney fan. You can check out some of the actual questions below, and feel free to scroll all the way to the bottom to check if you got them right!

After the quiz round, the rest of the night is all about puzzles. I've included a slideshow below that gives you an idea of what the puzzles were for Goofy's Mystiki Tour, but they were so much more than just brain teasers.

These puzzles required the teams to go out into Animal Kingdom to find clues and report them to Cast Member volunteers, who were all fantastic. My favorite of the bunch were the crew at the Kakamora Konundrum challenge, who were dressed as those adorable yet deadly coconut pirates from Moana. They just played the part so perfectly and had such a blast screaming "KAKAMORA" at every Cast Member that walked by.

As for the challenge, there were Kakamora (both played by humans and toys) that had flags raised certain ways. Teams had to use a semaphore flag signaling system to decipher a hidden message, and it was fun watching the teams and volunteers interacting and just having the best time.

The night culminated in a grand finale, and yes it was obviously attended by Goofy in a special outfit for this event, and the winners were awarded a special plaque that they'll be able to proudly display in their respective offices, declaring to the world they are the champions of this beloved event for at least one year.

The night was also hosted in part by Walt Disney World Ambassadors Phelicia Blake and Kylee Withers, and I was able to speak to them about Goofy's Mystery Tour and why this night means so much to Cast Members.

"This event in particular is just a great example of how we do everything uniquely Disney," Blake shared with me. "Everything that we do puts love into everything, and especially events like this, our teams want to make sure that these Cast Members feel the love that we always strive to give back to our guests. So this is really much a big thank you to our Cast Members for all that they do every day.

"And it's such a great thing that it's been running for over 30 years here at Walt Disney World, and our teams take in all the feedback and use that to make it even better year after year. It's all formulated in a way that is in the best interest of our wonderful cast."

"As Cast Members, we love Disney just as much as our guests do," Withers added. "But what makes Cast Members different is that they want to share their love of Disney with other people. It takes a very special person to be a Cast Member, a kind of person who says 'I love Disney, I want to share that magic of Disney with you, and I want to help you create magical memories here that will last a lifetime.' So, next time you see a Cast Member, thank them and know that they are the reason that you are able to have incredible memories here at Disney."

Part of the event took place in Animal Kingdom's Theater in the Wild.

To end this feature, I want to talk a little more about these Cast Members, because that's really what Goofy's Mystery Tour is about. We see their smiling faces and heroic deeds that make our visits to Disney Parks that much better, but they are people just like us that have good days and bad days. After all, a job is a job and it's not always magical. However, moments like this remind them why they are doing what they do and I think that is supremely important.

"I feel like one of the coolest parts of Goofy's Mystery Tour is that we put our phones away," Claire said. "This is three hours of just straight connection; working your brain, working hard, laughing, joking, and being together. It's definitely serious and intense, but it's probably my favorite Disney Cast event all year."

"Everybody is always looking out for each other and looking for the best for each other," Claire's teammate Alyssa said. "So, that is what I absolutely love about the culture here, and having that positive energy in the workplace with events like this, it's so easy to transfer that to guests."

"I have a friend who was a Cast Member many years ago, and she has competed in Goofy's Mystery Tour for multiple years," Withers recalled. "While she may be gone from Disney, her team continues to invite her back to compete here and she always makes her way back down to Florida. That really is a testament to the bonds that you build here at Disney."

I have so many more stories from the night that I'll hold close to my heart, and this experience has given me an even deeper appreciation for the Cast Members and all they do to make our Disney vacations unforgettable.

It was a powerful reminder that the littlest gestures can change someone's world for the better. Be it an extravagant after hours event at Walt Disney World or a parent sharing a core memory with their daughter or even a small thank you from a guest to a Cast Member after they went to infinity and beyond what they needed to do because they actually _do care._

Goofy's Mystery Tour was such an incredible experience for so many reasons, and I can't wait to get back to a Disney Park so I can pay it forward again and tell even more Cast Members how grateful I am for everything they do.
