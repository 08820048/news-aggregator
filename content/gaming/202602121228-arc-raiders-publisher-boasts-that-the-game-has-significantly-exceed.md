[Arc Raiders](https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders) continues to be an enormous hit for publisher Nexon, with 14 million copies sold and almost a million concurrent players online at one point last month.

In Nexon's latest financial results, the Korean publisher boasted that its sticky extraction shooter had "significantly exceeded expectations" and had "approximately six million weekly active users."

January's player peak saw roughly 960,000 people online at the same time — an impressive figure indeed, especially three months after its late October 2025 arrival.

"Since its October 30 launch, the game sustained top-ranking spots on Steam's Top Sellers list as well as PlayStation and Xbox," Nexon wrote in a [presentation](https://pdf.irpocket.com/C3659/YpwX/MxJ9/q7uK.pdf) shared with investors today. "\[It\] showed exceptional retention and strong player metrics... \[and we\] expect to sustain strong player engagement and sales momentum with monthly content drops and live events."

Developed by Swedish company Embark Studios, which is led by a team of former employees from Battlefield maker DICE, Arc Raiders enjoyed an explosive launch last year. The game shifted four million copies in under two weeks, and had sold 12 million by the start of January. Another month on, and Arc Raiders has now sold two million more.

[Steamcharts](https://steamcharts.com/app/1808500#3m) figures show ARC Raiders with a peak of over 465,000 players at the beginning of January, though numbers have begun to trail off slightly in February — with the game dipping below 250,000 concurrents for the first time over the course of the current week.

Still, player sentiment for the game continues to be positive, even as it suffers from a spate of item duplication glitches. Just yesterday, fans applauded Embark Studios for swiftly stopping another set of exploits – [though its efforts appear to have left a fresh inventory glitch in its place](https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-players-stunned-after-exploit-hotfix-results-in-widespread-reports-of-a-new-inventory-glitch).

Since laying out [a plan to deal with widespread reports of cheaters](https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-promises-significant-changes-after-players-report-widespread-issues-with-cheaters) last month, the studio has done its best to keep players coming back with frequent gameplay adjustments, new content, and a [four-month roadmap](https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-roadmap-promises-a-new-map-more-arcs-and-even-a-little-love-for-scrappy-by-april-2026). Its post-launch plan currently has it sitting in the middle of its Headwinds update, with its next chapter, Shrouded Sky, set to bring a new map condition and a new Arc threat later this month.
