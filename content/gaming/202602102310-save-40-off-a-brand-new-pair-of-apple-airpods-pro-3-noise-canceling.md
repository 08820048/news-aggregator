### Apple AirPods Pro 3 True Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds

The AirPods Pro 3 [launched on September 19](https://www.ign.com/articles/airpods-pro-3-where-to-buy) and is the newest generation AirPods Pro. Like its predecessor, this is easily the best earbuds for anyone who uses an iPhone. Although it looks pretty similar to the 2nd gen AirPods, there are some pretty significant improvements under the hood. The most notable new feature is the built-in heart rate sensing (which means you don't need an Apple Watch anymore), but the AirPods Pro 3 improves in other subtle ways as well, including better audio quality, better noise cancelation, long battery life, and a more weatherproof IP57 shell.

Released alongside the AirPods Pro 3 was Apple's "Live Translation", which is an Apple Intelligence feature that translates other languages on the fly. This isn't exclusive to the AirPods Pro since it can also be used with the 2nd gen AirPods Pro and the AirPods 4. First hand reports have been generally very positive, including this take from [PCMag](https://www.pcmag.com/news/thanks-to-apple-live-translation-my-wife-can-speak-spanish-with-her-in).
