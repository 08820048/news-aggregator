If you're in need of at-home printing but you don't want to deal with the upfront cost of buying a printer or the hassle of purchasing ink cartridges when they run out, then HP is offering a plan that might be perfect for you.

[HP's All-In Plan](https://go.linkby.com/IWWLWWIU) is a convenient service that leases you a printer for a low monthly fee. Never run out of ink or printing supplies. You’re always ready to print with ink and optional paper delivery before you need it. There are several plans to choose from, with each offering a different printer and print allotment depending on your needs. The monthly print allotment is flexible, rolls over and can easily be updated on a monthly basis if needed.

The four recommended plan tiers are as follows:

-   **Basic** \- HP Envy inkjet printer with 20 pages of printing for $7.99/mo
-   **Versatile** \- HP Envy Photo inkjet printer with 20 pages of printing for $9.99/mo
-   **High-Volume** \- HP Smart Tank with 100 pages of printing for $12.99/mo
-   **Professional** \- HP OfficeJet Pro with 50 pages of printing for $14.99/mo

The "High Volume" plan is marketed as the best value. It includes the HP Smart Tank 7602 all-in-one printer (retails for $470) and up to 100 pages of monthly printing. At $12.99 per month, it's not much more expensive than the "Basic" and "Versatile" plans. The one caveat is that it requires a three year commitment compared to two years for the other plans. Fortunately, HP offers a 30-day trial period during which you have the option to return your printer.

## Is the HP All-In Plan worth it?

The big question is whether or not HP's All-In Plan is worth it in the first place. We can first break this out monetarily. The "High Volume" plan will run you $12.99 per month for 3 years, or a grand total of $467.64. As mentioned above, the printer you get retails for $469.99. That's about the same cost, but there are other factors to consider.

By buying the printer outright, you could probably find a discount. For example, it's [currently on sale at Amazon for $349.99](https://zdcs.link/9ZArgn?object_uuid=b5bddc8f-5371-485c-bd5d-55a4e37e154a&t=article), saving you $120 right off the bat. Also, after 3 years, you'll still own the printer so that you can use it for many years after. If you subscribe to the plan, then you're out of a printer after 3 years unless you re-enroll.

However, by signing up for the plan, you avoid having to pay $400+ instantly, which is replaced by a more manageable monthly fee. You also essentially get three years of 24/7 live support and warranty service, as opposed to just one year if you bought the printer outright. You don't need to pay for ink during the life of the subscription. This is important because ink refills can get pricey very quickly to the point where it's often cheaper to just buy a new printer. You're also not stuck with the same printer forever. After the term ends, you can either choose to continue using your current printer or upgrade to a newer, current generation model.

All things considered, it really depends on your situation. If you can justify the upfront cost, you plan to keep the same printer for more than three years, and you feel comfortable enough sourcing your own ink, then just buy your own printer. If you'd rather stick with the convenience of letting HP worry about the printer along with its refills and maintenance, and you know that you can stay within the monthly printing allotment, then it's worth checking it out.
