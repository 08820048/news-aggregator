Konami is finally ready to share more about the last of the five Silent Hill projects announced back in 2022, [Silent Hill: Townfall](https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-townfall).

Coming hot on the heels of tomorrow's [PlayStation State of Play broadcast](https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-playstation-state-of-play-broadcast-for-this-week) at 2pm PT (5pm ET, 10pm UK), Konami will be revealing the latest updates from its horror series from 4pm PT, including "the latest news on Silent Hill: Townfall."

Konami similarly hosted a Transmission shortly after a State of Play last year, too. In that presentation, the publisher showed off a little of [Silent Hill f](https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-f) in Sony's showcase, then went into more detail in its bespoke presentation afterwards, so it's plausible we'll see the same happen tomorrow (February 12), too.

Without doubt the most mysterious of the five projects announced at the Silent Hill Transmission in 2022, the one-minute teaser that announced Screen Burn's (formerly known as No Code) Silent Hill: Townfall spawned more questions than answers, complete with [a secret message embedded in the spectrogram](https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-townfall-trailer-audio-secret-message) that ominously read "whatever heart this town had has now stopped." Four years later, we _still_ know very little about the secretive project, and the silence has been so disconcerting to some that in late 2024, publisher [Annapurna was compelled to publicly confirm the game](https://www.ign.com/articles/embattled-annapurna-insists-silent-hill-townfall-is-still-alive-despite-upheaval) was still in development.

With its abstruse messaging, secrets, and references to Silent Hill 1's Alessa, some fans hope that, unlike the two most recent projects, Silent Hill: The Short Message and Silent Hill f, Townfall will take us back to the mysterious town itself.

"Whelp, I think this puts to rest all the speculation that Townfall's been having a troubled development cycle lol," [posited](https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1r1j4x6/comment/o4pzdye/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) one happy fan. "Konami does this every year, they only focus on one SH project at a time and don't reveal anything about other projects until a few months after the most recent one has released. Expect to not hear anything else about the Silent Hill 1 Remake until 2027 for this very same reason."

"I still remember time when all this sub could talk about is old releases, now look at us, there is something new coming up almost every quarter of the year," [joked](https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1r1j4x6/comment/o4q1gde/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) another. "Say what you want but I am convinced Silent Hill fans are living major these days!"

"Yeah, I'm expecting the SOP into Transmission," another fan wrote on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/316512975085109248/1032410297216028784/1470955108828184757). "Doubt we will see much of SH1R, but they might mention it in the Transmission. With Townfall we will have officially gotten everything from the original Transmission."

"We are absolutely getting SH Townfall gameplay finally!" [added](https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1r1j4x6/comment/o4q1y84/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) someone else. "Also a small chance of a\[n\] actual trailer for [SH 1 Remake](https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-1-remake-officially-in-development-at-bloober-team-konami-has-announced). Don't get your hopes up for that SH2 Remake DLC."

That latter note refers to the dozens of [comments](https://x.com/SilentHill/status/2021388925982416947) from fans desperately wanting the Born from a Wish DLC for Silent Hill 2: Remake. Right across Discord, subreddit, and X/Twitter threads — including the Townfall Transmission tweet — you'll find loads of fans asking for the Maria-centric story DLC, with others clamoring for some kind of Silent Hill Master Collection.

Silent Hill series producer Motoi Okamoto [recently opened up on why Konami revealed three new Silent Hill games at once](https://www.ign.com/articles/konami-revealed-3-new-silent-hill-games-at-once-so-fans-knew-it-was-serious-about-resurrecting-the-horror-franchise) after a full decade of silence, saying the publisher was keen to stress to old fans and new that it was "serious" about resurrecting the flailing horror series.

Reflecting on how the series has performed since Konami's [inaugural Silent Hill Transmission back in October 2022](https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-transmission-everything-announced-from-todays-big-showcase), Okamoto [explained](https://x.com/obakemogura/status/1979168343471866101) how the impressive [Silent Hill 2 Remake](https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake) was designed with "half new, half old customers in mind" to ensure it could attract new fans to the franchise.

Of all the projects revealed since that 2022 showcase — [Silent Hill: The Short Message](https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-the-short-message), Silent Hill 2 Remake, [Silent Hill f](https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-f), Silent Hill: Townfall, and media projects [Silent Hill: Ascension](https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-ascension) and the movie, [Return to Silent Hill](https://www.ign.com/movies/return-to-silent-hill) — the majority have been received well by critics, fans, and new players alike, suggesting it was a gamble worth taking for the Japanese publisher.
