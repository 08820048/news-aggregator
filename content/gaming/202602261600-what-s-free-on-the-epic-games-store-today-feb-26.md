Epic is once again offering a pair of games that couldn't be more different. Those looking to tackle some mind-bending puzzles will want to check out _Boxes: Lost Fragments_, while _My Night Job_ offers up some old-school fun.

In [_Boxes: Lost Fragments_](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/boxes-lost-fragments-079041), you're a thief pillaging a mansion. You'll come across a series of mysterious, intricately designed puzzle boxes in a variety of shapes, like a clock or train. The official description is rather cryptic, stating, "Suddenly, you realize that this is no ordinary building and that you are no longer in control of what is unfolding, and perhaps never were. What should have been a quick in-and-out, turns into your own harrowing struggle for freedom and answers." There are just under two dozen puzzles to tackle, and _Boxes_ won't take you more than a [few hours to solve them all](https://howlongtobeat.com/game/144798).

The late-night shift in [_My Night Job_](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/my-night-job-a416a6) isn't tending a gas station or pouring drinks at a bar. Instead, you'll have to defend a building and its people against monsters. _My Night Job_ is a pixel art survival horror game where you'll use more than 60 weapons (from floor lamps to shotguns) to fend off various monsters. It's got a zany sense of humor and promises an old-school vibe: "The way it used to be, but better."

If you want to pick up _Boxes: Lost Fragments_ or _My Night Job_ for free, all you need to do is log in to the [Epic Games Store](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/) and claim them. They'll be free until Thursday, March 5 at 11 a.m. EST.

Previously, in February, Epic has given away [_Return to Ash_ and a starter pack for _Stalcraft: X_](https://www.polygon.com/free-on-epic-games-store-february-19-2026/); [_Nobody Wants to Die_ and _The Darkside Detective: A Fumble in the Dark_](https://www.polygon.com/free-on-epic-games-store-this-week-february-2026/); and [_Botany Manor_ and _Pixel Gun 3D_ DLC](https://www.polygon.com/epic-games-store-free-games-pc-february-5-botany-manor/).
