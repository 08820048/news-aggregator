Valve is introducing the ability to include your hardware specs in any reviews you leave on Steam.

Rolling out now in the Steam Client Beta — which means only those with access to the beta test can do this; those of us using the stable branch may have to wait a little — Valve explained that reviewers can "attach hardware specs when writing or updating a Steam User Review on a game's store page."

Some reviewers already include this information in the main body their reviews, but this new feature will not only add a reminder to players to do so, but also help players identify issues that could be unique to certain builds or hardware configurations.

Steam is also testing the additional option to provide anonymized framerate data, too. "When enabled Steam will collect gameplay framerate data, stored without connection to your Steam account but identified with the kind of hardware you are playing on," Valve explains in the [beta client patch notes](https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/505101717860253962) (thanks, [PC Gamer](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/steam-reviews-set-to-show-a-players-specs-so-its-easier-to-know-if-youll-share-their-experience-or-they-misread-the-minimum/)). "This data will help us learn about game compatibility and improve Steam. This feature is currently in Beta with a focus on devices running SteamOS."

The beta client also addresses an issue where streaming could leave downloads throttled even after the stream stopped, and fixed a bug that could result in Proton games showing up as "not valid on current platform" for users with "very large libraries when using offline mode."

Other improvements to the beta client include a redesigned settings layout and improved navigation across desktop, mobile, and Steam Deck devices. You'll also now be asked why you disagree with a Steam Deck Verified rating when you submit your feedback, although this'll remain optional for now.

When the [Steam Machine](https://www.ign.com/tech/steam-machine) was first announced back in November 2025, Valve suggested that the console-like PC would launch in the first quarter of 2026. But things might be more complicated now, as the company now says that the [AI shortages that are causing PC hardware to spike in price](https://www.ign.com/articles/2026-is-going-to-suck-for-pc-gaming), it needs [more time to nail down the price and release date for the Steam Machine and Steam Frame](https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-machine-possibly-delayed).
