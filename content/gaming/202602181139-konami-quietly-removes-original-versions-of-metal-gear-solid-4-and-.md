Konami has removed two Metal Gear games, [Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots](https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots) and [Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker](https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-peace-walker), from digital storefronts.

The Japanese company finally revealed [Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2](https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2) at last week's State of Play showcase, [promising to re-release Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker and Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots for PC and consoles](https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-finally-frees-mgs4-from-the-ps3-with-august-release-date-sony-state-of-play) this August. While it's exciting that two classic tactical espionage action titles are getting touch-ups, more importantly, it means MGS4 will finally be playable on something other than PS3 when the collection launches August 27, 2026.

Shortly after that announcement, however, [players noticed](https://x.com/SlySinatraa/status/2023502331527184872) that the two games included in the collection had been pulled from the PlayStation and Xbox stores.

It could be that Konami has removed the older games to avoid confusion when pre-ordering the new collection. A less charitable interpretation is that the publisher has removed the original versions to funnel sales towards the new one. Even though the games were only available on very old systems like PSP, PS3, and Xbox 360, Metal Gear Solid 4 had previously been streamable on PlayStation.

IGN has asked Konami for comment.

Konami released [Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1](https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1) in October 2023. Mixed in with [the troubled launch](https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1-is-packed-with-problems-on-pc) of the first bundle was [a leak](https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-fans-uncover-additional-evidence-of-possible-mgs-4-remaster-and-more), as [confirmed by IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-4-finally-freed-from-ps3-as-part-of-leaked-metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2), suggesting more MGS re-releases were on the way, but it wasn’t until August 2024 that the publisher would finally [tell fans to “stay tuned.”](https://www.ign.com/articles/how-about-metal-gear-solid-4-in-metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-stay-tuned-konami-says)

Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2 is coming to PC via Steam, PS5, Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, and Xbox Series X/S. While we wait to see if Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2 will have a more stable launch than its predecessor, you can read about [what Konami is doing to reassure players](https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-had-a-pretty-rough-launch-so-konami-says-its-being-more-careful-with-vol-2).
