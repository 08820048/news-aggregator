After Epic Games teased a collaboration between [_Fortnite_ and the beloved anime series _Solo Leveling_](https://www.polygon.com/fortnite-solo-leveling-collab-release-date-skins/) earlier this week, we didn't have to wait long to see what they were cooking up. The first two skins from _Solo Leveling_'s [_Fortnite_](https://www.polygon.com/game/fortnite/2417/) crossover have been revealed, with a teaser showing protagonist Sung Jin-woo and Blood-Red Commander Igris — though they might not look exactly like you remember.

_Solo Leveling_, which was originally created as a web novel by South Korean author Chugong, tells the story of Jin-woo, who hails from a world where mysterious “Gates” connect Earth to a variety of dungeons filled with monsters. Those monsters are fought against by a group of humans known as Hunters, who have ranked abilities. Formerly the lowest-ranked Hunter, Jin-Woo gains a unique power called the “System” after surviving a deadly dungeon quest. Thanks to this power, he can now grow stronger without limits and use his abilities to extract and command fallen enemies as his own shadow army. Meanwhile, Igris serves as a primary shadow servant to Jin-woo.

The teaser, which Epic Games released on _Fortnite_'s Instagram account, is captioned, "Knight Commander Igris the Bloodred. Will you submit to my control? Arise. Arise… ARISE!" The wording there is important, as [Forbe](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2026/02/18/fortnites-solo-leveling-skins-are-leaking-and-theres-a-weird-catch/)s notes that this crossover isn't based on the _Solo Leveling_ anime or web novel, but rather the free-to-play mobile gacha game [_Solo Leveling: Arise_](https://www.polygon.com/608028/solo-leveling-arise-overdrive-release-demo-impressions/), originally released in 2024. So if the characters look a bit different than you expected, chances are that's the reason why. They were redesigned for use in that game. All the same, this collaboration gets _Solo Leveling_ characters into _Fortnite_, which some fans will certainly enjoy.

In the teaser, Jin-woo brings Igris to life before they head off to fight the good fight in _Fortnite_. Shortly after the arrival of the teaser, we got a much better look at Jin-woo and the Statue of God back bling, and it's as delightfully creepy as anyone could have hoped for.

Following the initial tease earlier this week, leakers noted that three skins were coming as part of a bundle: Sung Jin-woo, Cha Hae-In, and either Igris _or_ Beru. With Igris seemingly confirmed, that suggests a Beru skin probably isn't coming. Then again, this wouldn't be the first time _Fortnite_ has sold a four-character bundle in the store. Even the recent [_South Park_ crossover](https://www.polygon.com/fortnite-south-park-collab-release-date-epic-games/) included a five-skin bundle for purchase. So perhaps we'll end up with Igris _and_ Beru.

While not confirmed just yet, the _Solo Leveling_ cosmetics are expected to land in the _Fortnite_ shop's Friday update (which goes live on Thursday at 7 p.m. ET/4 p.m. PT).
