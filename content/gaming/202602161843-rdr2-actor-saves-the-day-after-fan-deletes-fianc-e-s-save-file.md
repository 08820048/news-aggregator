Like many entertainers, Arthur Morgan voice actor Roger Clark has a Cameo account, where fans can pay him for a custom greeting. He's wished fans happy birthdays, congratulated them on engagements and marriages, and [insisted they enjoy their time together](https://www.cameo.com/recipient/698a83963d0c140c572c28db) on [Valentine's Day](https://www.polygon.com/valentines-day-game-movie-tv-recommendations/). But one of the strangest video requests Clark says he's received recently came from a man who deleted his girlfriend's [_Red Dead Redemption 2_](https://www.polygon.com/red-dead-redemption-pokemon-mod-interview/) save file and wants Clark to do the apologizing for him (via [IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/let-us-all-send-this-poor-girl-positive-vibes-arthur-morgan-actor-roger-clark-reveals-cameo-apology-request-from-man-who-deleted-fiances-red-dead-redemption-2-save-file)).

"I enjoy them all," Clark said of his Cameo requests in a [recent X post](https://x.com/rclark98/status/2022059161887137920). "But it's ones like these below that I live for. Let us all send this poor girl positive vibes. At least her man knows what he did."

Clark shared screenshots of the request form, which lists the occasion as "Apology for deleting Red Dead saved game."

"I just deleted my Fiance's saved game in Red Dead Redemption II by accident," the instructions field reads. "She was having so much fun and made every ethical decision, had about 2/3 completed. Can you say some words of support for this devastating loss and let her know I am sorry?"

The comments section on Clark's post is torn, with some stating they'd be heartbroken, and others wondering how the save was accidentally deleted to begin with.

"That right there is a real test of a relationship!" one user [commented.](https://x.com/Ennem_Kay/status/2022066256430739824) "On the plus side, she will be able to play that masterpiece again with more knowledge than before," read a slightly more optimistic [reply](https://x.com/RedheadWanderer/status/2022060572507091438).

To date, the _Red Dead Redemption 2_ actor has completed 3,027 video commissions on Cameo and holds a [five-star rating on the platform](https://www.cameo.com/rollingrog).

"I really am blown away by the support you guys show me on cameo," Clark said on X. "Thank you for liking my shout outs."

No word yet on the state of the relationship in question, but it seems likely Clark will film the Cameo, given his comment that he "lives for" off-the-wall requests like this one. Plus, things could always be worse. At least in this instance, the girlfriend's save file wasn't [deleted on purpose](https://www.reddit.com/r/BORUpdates/comments/1jag432/aitah_for_deleting_my_girlfriends_sims_save_files/).
