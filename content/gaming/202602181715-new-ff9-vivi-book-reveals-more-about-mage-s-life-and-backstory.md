After it mesmerized readers in Japan when it came out last year, the _Final Fantasy 9_ picture book focused on the most charming black mage in Final Fantasy is finally receiving an English version. _Vivi and Grandpa's Memories for the Sky_ will be released on May 19, priced at $17.99, and is already available for pre-order.

As part of [_Final Fantasy 9_'s 25th anniversary celebration](https://www.polygon.com/gaming/611293/final-fantasy-9-remake-merch-anniversary/) last year, Square Enix released _Vivi and Grandpa's Memories for the Sky_, wherein the early years of Vivi's life are told as he is guided by his adoptive grandfather, Quan. Written by Kazuhiko Aoki, who worked on _Final Fantasy 9_ as an event designer, the book covers touching moments between Quan and Vivi as the little black mage learns about the world.

The cherries on top of this wholesome sundae are the illustrations drawn by Toshiyuki Itahana. He was one of the character designers on _Final Fantasy 9_ and is credited with Vivi's design. His drawings in _Vivi and Grandpa's Memories for the Sky_ show Vivi and Quan in day-to-day situations, like Vivi showing his magic to other kids or Quan preparing a rather dangerous meal.

Although the story in _Final Fantasy 9_ explains who Vivi is, it never provides a thorough flashback of his life with his grandfather — only glimpses. The book expands on this period of his life with Itahana's illustrations. In one of the most memorable illustrations in the book, we see Quan measuring Vivi's height. That memorable moment in a child's life was also the origin of Vivi's name. Following the 25th anniversary celebration, [Itahana decided to leave Square Enix](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/its-the-right-moment-final-fantasy-9-character-designer-toshiyuki-itahana-quits-square-enix/) after having worked for the company for more than 30 years.
