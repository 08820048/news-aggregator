## **The highlights**

In its Digital Contents business, Capcom reported net sales of ¥73.4 billion ($477.3 million), up 25.4% year-on-year.

The company attributed this increase to its efforts in expanding catalog titles sales, particularly with its Resident Evil and Street Fighter franchises.

On mobile, Resident Evil Survival Unit surpassed three million downloads following its release last November. The title had already [reached one million downloads within 24 hours of launch](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/resident-evil-survival-unit-tops-1-million-downloads-in-24-hours-news-in-brief).

As for Street Fighter, cumulative global sales of Street Fighter 6 surpassed six million units following the release of the Nintendo Switch 2 version.

Capcom's Devil May Cry and Monster Hunter franchises also contributed to its earnings considerably during the fiscal period.

It highlighted that sales of Devil May Cry 5 were strong due to coordinated price strategies with the Netflix adaptation, alongside "efforts to enhance brand value through building wider awareness of the IP."

Unit sales of Monster Hunter Rise and Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak continued to rise, while cumulative sales of Monster Hunter Wilds reached 11 million units following its February 2025 launch.

Overall, Capcom's Digital Content segment saw total unit sales of 34.64 million, up from 30.53 million sold during the previous fiscal period.

Capcom also experienced a significant 73.5% increase in net sales within its Amusement Equipments segment, which includes smart pachislo machines, reaching ¥17.7 billion ($115.1 million).

Looking ahead, Capcom said it expects to achieve its projected earnings forecast for the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2026.
