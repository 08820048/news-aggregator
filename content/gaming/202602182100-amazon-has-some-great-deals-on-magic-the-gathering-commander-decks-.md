There’s nothing better than a [Magic: The Gathering](https://www.ign.com/games/magic-the-gathering-trading-card-game) Commander night with friends, and [Wizards of the Coast keeps releasing plenty of preconstructed decks](https://www.ign.com/wikis/magic-the-gathering/Every_MTG_Commander_Precon_Deck_in_Order) so you can jump right in with friends or start to build around a choice card.

They’re pretty regularly discounted, too, which is always appreciated, but right now Amazon has some fantastic deals on Lorwyn Eclipsed’s duo of decks and a huge bundle of Tarkir Dragonstorm decks, too. Here’s why they’re worth a look.

### Lorwyn Eclipsed - Commander Deck

Blight Curse

Kicking off with the latest set, Lorwyn Eclipsed, there are two decks available for the set.

Blight Curse is helmed by Auntie Ool, Cursewretch (or The Reaper, King No More), and leans into the -1/-1 counters archetype that we really don’t see too much of in precons. It’s a fantastic deck—possibly one of the best in recent memory—[and has a few bucks knocked off the price to bring it to $45.49](https://zdcs.link/znB88D?object_uuid=2c9089bd-03c5-49cb-8b85-badd1ddfdea8&t=article).

It’s joined by Dance of the Elements, which has an even better price. The five-color Elementals deck is all about making copies of big creatures and is helmed by Ashling, the Limitless (or Mass of Mysteries). [It’s currently just $37.99](https://zdcs.link/Qb8mmJ?object_uuid=2c9089bd-03c5-49cb-8b85-badd1ddfdea8&t=article), a 24% discount on a great precon.

### Lorwyn Eclipsed - Precon Bundle (x4 Decks, x2 of Each)

Better yet, [we recently pointed out that you can buy a bundle that includes two of each deck](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-lorwyn-eclipsed-commander-decks-are-30-each-with-this-bundle) for around $80 off, and that’s still true. That means you and a friend can spend $60 each and each get both decks!

Onto Tarkir: Dragonstorm, then, and while the 2025 was somewhat overshadowed by Universes Beyond: Final Fantasy dropping right after, it remains a great set.

### Magic: The Gathering Tarkir: Dragonstorm - Commander Deck Bundle - Includes All 5 Decks

Its Commander decks had a wide range of reprint values, but they’re all fun to use. I own three of them myself and have had a blast playing with Sultai Arisen. Can’t pick? Good news - [Amazon has a discount on a bundle of all five](https://zdcs.link/aoJeZv?object_uuid=2c9089bd-03c5-49cb-8b85-badd1ddfdea8&t=article) (that’s right, five) decks.

The bundle would cost $224.95, but is now $195, bringing each deck down to $39. While some are going for around that number, Temur Roar was particularly popular at launch and shot up in value. In fact, it’s still $60 on its own.

That deck is particularly good because it essentially drops a ton of Dragons on the board for big damage, but the others are fun, too.

Jeskai Striker is all about playing rapid spells, while Sultai Arisen has a graveyard recursion theme that helps keep opponents guessing.

Mardu Surge is focused on tokens and sacrifice, while Abzan Armor is a ‘toughness matters’ deck that turns colossal defenders into terrifying attackers.

You really can’t go wrong with any of them, and if you’re new to the format, Tarkir’s decks are relatively easy to pilot, too.
