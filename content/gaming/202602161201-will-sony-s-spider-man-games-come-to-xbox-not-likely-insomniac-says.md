Could an Xbox version of Insomniac’s Spider-Man games eventually be released, given parent company Sony’s recent softening on multiplatform not just on PC, but with the likes of Helldivers 2 and Marathon coming to Microsoft’s console? Based on a comment from Insomniac itself, Xbox owners shouldn’t hold their breath.

A fan replied to a tweet from Insomniac celebrating Valentine’s Day to ask about the possibility of Spider-Man swinging onto Xbox, and [the developer’s response](https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/2022752405444505766) was pretty clear: “Not likely.”

Now, you might say that’s obvious. But, as the replies have pointed out, once upon a time Insomniac ruled out Marvel's Spider-Man ever coming to PC, and it ended up making the jump from PlayStation exclusivity to personal computers.

> it will never appear on Xbox or PC. It's a permanent PS4 exclusive publisher by Sony Interactive Entertainment

Now, nearly nine years after that tweet, Sony not only publishes games on PC, but on Xbox and Nintendo Switch. Arrowhead’s record-breaking Helldivers 2, for example, [launched on Xbox Series X and S complete with a Halo crossover](https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-officially-getting-halo-odst-content-but-its-first-legendary-warbond-is-going-to-cost-you). And Bungie’s upcoming extraction shooter [Marathon](https://www.ign.com/games/marathon) is coming out on Xbox as well as PC and PlayStation. The times have changed.

Spider-Man, though, does feel like it would be crossing a thicker line to get to Xbox, and Insomniac’s tweet suggests that to be the case. In the shorter term, Insomniac’s Marvel’s Wolverine is due out later this year — exclusively on PlayStation 5. Meanwhile, Insomniac fans expect another Spider-Man game eventually, a continuation of the story as set out in 2023’s Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which launched on PC in January last year. (Last year, Yuri Lowenthal suggested [Marvel’s Spider-Man 3 will see Peter Parker doing his Spider-Man thing](https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-3-actor-says-peter-parker-wont-be-relegated-to-the-couch) despite what the ending of Spider-Man 2 suggests.)

Sony’s approach contrasts with that of Microsoft, which has fully embraced multiplatform for pretty much all its first-party video games. [When Microsoft finally announced Playground’s Forza Horizon 6](https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-6-set-in-japan-launches-2026) and confirmed it would launch on PlayStation 5 _after_ Xbox and PC, it came as a surprise. Nowadays, Xbox Game Studios is one of the most prolific and successful publishers on PlayStation.

In October last year, [Microsoft said the idea of a video game exclusive locked to a single storefront had become “antiquated for most people,”](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-idea-of-locking-it-to-one-store-or-one-device-is-antiquated-for-most-people-xbox-president-says-microsoft-is-seeing-players-evolve-way-past-big-blockbuster-exclusive-games) but Sony still refuses to launch its big single-player games on anything other than PlayStation day-one (the latest example of this is Sucker Punch's Ghost of Yotei). Multiplayer games, however do tend to launch on PC at the same time. Guerrilla’s recently announced co-op action game Horizon Hunters Gathering is set for PS5 and PC. Marathon’s day-one multiplatform launch is something of an outlier.
