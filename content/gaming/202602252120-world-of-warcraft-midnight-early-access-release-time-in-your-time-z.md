**_World of Warcraft: Midnight_**, the 11th (_eleventh!_) expansion to Blizzard's long-running massively multiplayer game, is upon us. Story-wise, _Midnight_ is the second part of a trilogy called The Worldsoul Saga, which started with 2024's _The War Within_. But it's very much a full-fledged _WoW_ expansion, with new and reworked zones, new systems, the long-awaited introduction of [housing](https://www.polygon.com/world-of-warcraft-housing-early-access/), and other [radical changes](https://www.polygon.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-prepatch-12-0-mods-addons/) to the way people play the almost 22-year-old MMO.

_Midnight_'s global launch is on March 2 (or March 3, depending on your time zone). But there's also an **early access** period starting Feb. 26 for players who purchase the Epic Edition of the expansion.

Here's **when _World of Warcraft: Midnight_ releases in early access in your time zone**, plus a little bit about what to expect.

## What to expect from World of Warcraft: Midnight

Like any _WoW_ expansion, _Midnight_ brings a wealth of new features and content to the game, and will be followed by several phases of updates over the course of more than a year. Here are the biggest additions coming at launch:

-   **A new campaign storyline** as the heroes of Azeroth battle a void invasion orchestrated by Xal'atath, the Harbinger.
-   **Four new and reworked adventuring zones**: the blood elf homelands of Eversoong Woods, the Amani troll empire of Zul'Aman, the fungal jungle of Harandar, and the cosmic wasteland of Voidstorm. Silvermoon City has also been reworked to serve as the expansion's hub.
-   **Player housing** available in _WoW_ for the first time, with a vast array of décor items to collect across the entire game.
-   **New allied race the Haranir** available to unlock and play. They're sort of primordial jungle elves.
-   **New Demon Hunter class specialization: Devourer**, a mid-range caster. The Demon Hunter class is also available to Void Elves for the first time.
-   **The Prey system** which will see players track — and be ambushed by — powerful targets in outdoor adventuring zones.
-   **New raids, dungeons, and single-player Delves**, with a new NPC companion for Delves.
-   **New PvP battleground Slayer's Rise**.
-   **New level cap of 90** and Apex talents.
-   **The Arcantina**, a social and lore hub featuring familiar characters and nostalgic questlines.
