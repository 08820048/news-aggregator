If it's time to upgrade your gaming monitor, you can't go wrong with an OLED. And if you've got the funds to get the biggest and best, LG's highest-end OLED is the [45" LG UltraGear 45GX950A-B](https://zdcs.link/av8x37?object_uuid=0f6882e0-c6ad-40dd-acfc-2332bfd262ee&t=article) 5K2K gaming monitor. It normally retails for a hefty $2,000, but Amazon has just discounted it to $1350.18 with free delivery. This is the lowest price I've ever seen for this particular monitor, just make sure your desk has enough space to accomodate this ultra-wide behemoth.

**Update:** LG is offering "[Outlet Pricing](https://zdcs.link/zE8VJP?object_uuid=0f6882e0-c6ad-40dd-acfc-2332bfd262ee&t=article)" at $1389 (scroll down until you see it). As-is it's not as good of a deal, but you may be able to get a lower price if you have a coupon code sitting in your inbox or by signing up for the newsletter. Sometimes LG will also send you a coupon code if you just leave the item sitting in your coupon code for a little while. YMMV.

## 45" LG UltraGear 5K2K Gaming Monitor for $1,350

### 45" LG UltraGear 45GX950A-B 5K2K 165Hz G-Sync OLED Gaming Monitor

The LG UltraGear 45GX950A-B is the first OLED monitor featuring a 5120x2160 resolution. That averages out to a pixel density of 125ppi, which is excellent for a monitor of this size. As a comparison, a 42" 4K monitor, 34" 3440x1440 monitor, and 27" QHD monitor all have an industry standard 109ppi. Since this is such a wide monitor, it features a fairly aggressive 800R curve for maximum immersion and so you can keep the screen's edge in the periphery of your vision.

The 45GX950A-B uses a true OLED panel that boasts a near-instanteous (0.03ms) response time and a near-infinite (1.5 million : 1) contrast ratio with the ability to produce true blacks. OLEDs simply have the best image quality compared to any other panel type, with no smearing, no blooming, no "gray is the new black", and no uneven backlighting or haziness. This is a "dual-mode" monitor with refresh rates of up to 165Hz at 4K and 330Hz at down-scaled 1080p. The monitor also supports adaptic sync technologies including FreeSync Premium Pro and G-Sync.

Current generation connectivity specs include one DisplayPort 2.1 port and two HDMI 1.4 ports. There's also a USB Type-C port with 90W of power delivery. Rare among high end monitors, the 45GX950A-B has built-in speakers and even a 4-pole headphone jack with DTS Headphone:X spatial audio support.

Finally, the monitor comes with a 2 year warranty that **includes OLED burn-in coverage.**
