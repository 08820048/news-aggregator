In a shocking turn of events, there has been a major executive turnover at [Xbox](https://www.polygon.com/xbox/), which will see both [Microsoft Gaming](https://www.polygon.com/analysis/610779/microsoft-layoffs-perfect-dark-everwild-mismanagement/) CEO [Phil Spencer](https://www.polygon.com/24108700/phil-spencer-interview-2024-xbox-exclusives-layoffs/) and his heir apparent, Xbox president Sarah Bond, exit the company. In Spencer's place, Microsoft CoreAI president Asha Sharma is stepping in, [Microsoft announced Friday](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2026/02/20/asha-sharma-named-evp-and-ceo-microsoft-gaming/).

Sharma said in an email to Microsoft employees that in her role as CEO of Microsoft Gaming, "We will recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world."

Matt Booty, formerly head of Xbox Game Studios at Microsoft, will now serve as Xbox chief content officer under Sharma. In an email to staff, he wrote, "Looking forward, I’m excited to partner with Asha as our next CEO. Our first conversations centered on her commitment to making great games and the role that plays in our overall success."

Spencer's retirement will begin Monday, Feb. 23. In an email to staff, he revealed he first approached Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella about stepping away last fall. "From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we’ve built," Nadella wrote. "Xbox has always been more than a business. It’s a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it. And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead."

The now-former Microsoft Gaming CEO also spoke warmly of outgoing Xbox president Bond, writing, "Sarah has been instrumental during a defining period for Xbox, shaping our platform strategy, expanding Game Pass and cloud gaming, supporting new hardware launches, and guiding some of the most significant moments in our history. I’m grateful for her partnership and the impact she’s had, and I wish her the very best in what comes next."

At the time of publishing, Bond had not publicly commented on resigning from her role. That's a stark change from Bond's front-and-center position in promoting Xbox products in recent years, where she talked about the future of Xbox on devices like the [Asus ROG Ally](https://www.polygon.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-review/) and in the form of a forthcoming [PC-like Xbox successor to the Xbox Series X and S](https://www.polygon.com/xbox/607616/microsoft-amd-next-gen-xbox-pc/).

Spencer started at Microsoft in 1988 as an intern and has been working with Xbox since its 2001 launch. He was promoted to CEO of Microsoft Gaming in 2022.
