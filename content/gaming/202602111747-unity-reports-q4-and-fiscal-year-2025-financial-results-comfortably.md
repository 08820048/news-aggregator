Unity reports fourth-quarter results that "comfortably exceeded" its high-end guidance, including a boost in its Create Solutions and Grow Solutions revenue by 8% and 11%, respectively.

Overall revenue was up 10% year-on-year to $503 million as former Unity CEO and founder David Helgason stepped down from the board, effective immediately.

"Fourth quarter results once again comfortably exceeded the high-end of our guidance, led by exceptional performance from Vector, which experienced its third consecutive quarter of mid-teen sequential revenue growth, and the best growth we've seen in Create in over two years," said Matt Bromberg, president and CEO of Unity.

"With Vector demonstrating rapid growth and Unity 6 adoption at the fastest rate we've ever experienced, our goal of becoming the essential infrastructure for the next generation of interactive entertainment is coming into clear focus."

Here's what you need to know:

### The numbers

-   Revenue: $503 million (up 10% year-on-year)
-   Create Solutions revenue: $165 million (up 8% year-on-year)
-   Grow Solutions revenue: $338 million (up 11% year-on-year)
-   Net loss: $89 million (with a margin of 18%).

### The highlights

Unity credits the 8% increase in its Create Solutions revenue to "strong growth in subscription revenue," and said the 11% hike in Grow Solutions revenue was "drive by mid-teen sequential quarterly revenue growth from Unity Vector, which represents 56% of total Grow Solutions revenue" across the quarter.

It's this growth that has offset the decline in its IronSource Ad Network as IronSource founder Tomer Bar-Zeev also stepped down from the board of directors, effective immediately.

Looking ahead, Unity forecasts Q1 2026 revenue of around $485 million, with flat growth in Grow, and "double-digit year-over-year revenue growth" for its Create segment.

Commenting on the departure of Helgason and Bar-Zeev, Matt Bromberg, president and CEO of Unity, said: "David and Tomer have been vital partners as we've grown and transformed Unity. They welcomed me into the Company, shared their unique vision as founders, and have provided unfailing support. I'm looking forward to many more years of conversation with both of them."

Bernard Kim, former president of publishing at Zynga, has been appointed to the board, effective May 1.

"Unity plays a foundational role in how interactive experiences are created, distributed, and scaled," said Kim. "I've long admired the company’s impact on the industry, and I'm excited to work with the Board and leadership team as Unity accelerates its mission to democratize game development."

Reports last December alleged that [Unity was introducing a new annual fee for its largest Enterprise users](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/unity-reportedly-introduces-250k-minimum-contribution-for-its-biggest-customers), requiring a "minimum commitment" of $250,000 to $2 million, depending on each game's revenue. It will reportedly be "applied towards your purchase of Unity subscription license and support products."

Unity's [website](https://unity.com/products/pricing-updates) now warns Enterprise subscribers that "a minimum subscription requirement may apply" to 2026 pricing, and both Pro and Enterprise subscription prices increased by 5% last month.
