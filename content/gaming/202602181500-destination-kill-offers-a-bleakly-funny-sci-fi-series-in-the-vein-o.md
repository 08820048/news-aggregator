IGN can exclusively reveal the latest new series from Oni Press, and it's one that will appeal to anyone who prefers their dystopian sci-fi with a dash of humor. That series is Destination Kill, and it's worth keeping an eye on.

Check out the slideshow gallery below to see cover art and interior pages from Destination Kill #1:

Destination Kill is a four-issue limited series that serves as the solo debut for cartoonist Joe Palmer (Time Before Time). The first issue features cover art by Palmer, Riley Rossmo, Ronald Wimberly, Tango, and Liana Kangas.

Here's Oni's official description of the series:

_The year is 2125, and the all-powerful corporation Overcon uses its robot workers to pour our drinks and dispense our meds, all while rebuilding London’s Central City into a hyper-modern megalopolis bolted together in its own image. But as Overcon prepares to celebrate the first year of its Paradise Loop—a superfast transatlantic train that connects the Central City to New York in under 60 minutes—an unwieldy army of displaced human workers floods the streets with weapons, plotting an attack at the anniversary gala. Enter: Gina Serene, a stressed-out, pill-popping police detective in desperate need of a vacation and her ex-partner turned P.I., Lance Wingman—who are now the only thing standing between Overcon’s skyscraper-sized fist and the worker uprising that threatens to bring Britain's capital crashing down around them._

“DESTINATION KILL started life as an image in my mind of a lone, masked builder armed with a pistol, standing on the snow-covered rooftop of St. Paul’s Cathedral in London,” said Palmer in a statement. “That image really stuck with me, and over time it evolved into this fantastical story of a transatlantic train and a citywide builder-led revolution that I knew I had to make someday. This book is me taking the (long overdue!) step of being in total creative control of my work, which turned out to be one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. I wasn’t consciously thinking about it at the time, but at least part of the reason for doing this was to put something out in the world that represents me and my personality, and I feel like I’ve done that.”

Destination KIll #1 will be released on May 13, 2026. You can preorder a copy at [your local comic shop](https://www.comicshoplocator.com/).
