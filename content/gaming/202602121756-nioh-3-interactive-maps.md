Our **_Nioh 3_ interactive maps** have everything you need if you're looking to complete Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo's latest Soulslike. The series has gone open-world — or open-field, technically — for the first time, with three distinct regions to explore. Tokugawa Takechiyo, the game's protagonist, is sent back in time to deal with the reign of terror caused by their brother, Tokugawa Kunimatsu, and stop the Yokai army, and that means dispatching of all the tough enemies around historical Japan. The epic adventure spans multiple historical periods, forcing Takechiyo to fight for independence through **The Warring States**, banish evil during the **Heian Era**, and combat a wicked future in the **Bakumatsu** timeline.

On each map, you'll find everything from **Kodamas** to send home, **Chijikos** to shoot and pet, **Six Jizo statues** to pray to, **Scampusses** to chase, **hot springs** to bathe in, and all the crucible and enemy bases you can complete. Not to mention all the shrine locations, masters, spirit veins, and more. So whether you're exploring the Warring States or Heian period in [_Nioh 3_](http://www.polygon.com/nioh-3/), we have all the details you need.
