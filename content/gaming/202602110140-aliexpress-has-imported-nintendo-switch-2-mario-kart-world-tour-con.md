The Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World Bundle currently sells for $500 just about everywhere, but there's a way you can get it for less. [AliExpress](https://zdcs.link/QG8vWW?object_uuid=3143f08d-180b-4404-8a74-02230ed388dc&t=article) is currently offering [imported bundles](https://zdcs.link/QG8vWW?object_uuid=3143f08d-180b-4404-8a74-02230ed388dc&t=article) for $458.12 after you apply a $60 off coupon code "**60USAFF**" during checkout. It ships free locally from the United States (which means no tariffs and quick shipping).

The listing is for a Hong Kong import. Fortunately, all international Switch 2 consoles are **region unlocked**, so they can be used in the US without any modification. You'll also be able to select English as your default language. This specific model will come with a Hong Kong style plug, but a US adapter is included. Imported consoles do not get a US-based Nintendo warranty. Fortunately, Aliexpress offers a generous 90-day free return window.

## Nintendo Switch 2 (Import) with Mario Kart World for $458

The Switch 2 console was released on June 5, 2025. It is backwards compatible with nearly all Switch games as well as the original Joy-Cons and Switch Pro controller, although the new Switch 2 controllers offer more functionality. In his [Nintendo Switch 2 review](https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review), Tom Marks sums up the Switch 2 as "a vital but unexciting upgrade to a console I already love."

At this point, several major Switch 2 video games have been released: Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, Pokemon Legends: Z-A, and more recently, Kirby Air Riders and [Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment](https://www.ign.com/articles/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review). Several triple-A ports are also available, including [Cyberpunk 2077](https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-review-update) and [Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade](https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-review-update), making the Switch 2 a veritable competitor to pricier handheld gaming PCs. The Switch 2 hardware is powerful enough to run these games at a very playable clip, something that was impossible on the original Switch's increasingly outdated hardware. Whereas there was "nothing" to play when the Switch 2 was originally released, there are now plenty of reasons to finally justify an upgrade.
