Supercell has published its financial results for 2025, reporting a 4% drop in revenue to €2.65 billion.

The Finnish mobile developer generated profits before taxes of €932 million, a 6% increase compared to the same period last year.

Supercell contributed €220 million in corporate income taxes to the Finnish economy in 2025, and its headcount grew by 30% year-over-year ending the year with 890 employees globally.

Its live game portfolio experienced year-over-year growth, reaching an overall estimated 290 million active players every month.

Clash Royale was described as its "standout success," reaching "record highs" in engagement metrics including daily active players. In a [blog post](https://supercell.com/en/news/the-best-games-havent-been-made-yet/) detailing its financial results, CEO Ilkka Paananen said new players grew by almost 500% across the year.

Supercell doubled its investment in new game development in 2025, with Paananen stating the company expects "to roughly double it again."

"While many companies have scaled back, we've moved in the opposite direction," he said. "Our strong live games performance, especially Clash Royale's historic year, gives us the ability to make these long-term bets. We're fortunate to be in this position, and we intend to use it."

Paananen also addressed [shutting down Squad Busters less than 18 months after launch](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/supercell-calls-time-on-squad-busters-less-than-18-months-after-launch).

"Internal pressure was building at Supercell to take bold risks," he wrote. "But don't get me wrong – not top-down pressure from me or the leadership team – just the human reality that we hadn't successfully launched a game in six years.

"As \[game lead\] Eino Joas put it: 'We had a success rate of 100% on our previous five launches. We all felt that our risk appetite was getting too constrained, and we weren't being bold enough. So we launched'."

Paananen concluded: "The bottom line: the team believes they should have run a third, longer-duration beta. That might have exposed the mismatch between the game and player expectations earlier. It sounds simple. It wasn't."
