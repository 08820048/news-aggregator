Amazon's [**buy 1, get 1 50% off deal**](https://zdcs.link/9wBKby?object_uuid=97eef5f9-076d-415c-a73b-868c9bf2bb1f&t=article) on [books](https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-bogo-book-sale-february-2026), [movies](https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-and-pixar-4k-blu-ray-sale-february-2026), [board games](https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-has-a-buy-1-get-1-half-price-sale-on-4k-blu-ray-movies-board-games-february-2026), and more is still going strong. But, notably, as part of the promotion, you can now pick up some of [DC's best comic runs in their "Compact Editions" printings](https://zdcs.link/9ZABgY?object_uuid=97eef5f9-076d-415c-a73b-868c9bf2bb1f&t=article), which are 5.5in by 8.5in. paperback reprints of stories.

This is a fantastic opportunity to pick up some of the best comics of all time, at even better prices. Most of these are already seeing small discounts, from 7% to 13% off, but they all have an extremely affordable MSRP of $9.99 anyway, making this bundle deal even sweeter. Even if you're picking up just two, you're still looking at a splendid deal at no more than $15 total, depending on your picks.

You can also take advantage of it as many times as you like, so pack your basket with four comics, and get 50% off two of them, six, and 50% off three, and so forth. Nothing has changed for these fantastic comics besides the size, so if that's not something you care about and have been wanting to jump into some of DC's best, this is the perfect opportunity to do so. Trust me, there's plenty to choose from here.

Everything from Superman and Batman to Watchmen and Harley Quinn is included, so there's something for everyone depending on your preferred flavor of DC comics. For the Batman fans, you can't go wrong with checking out Scott Snyder's and Greg Capullo's iconic Batman: The Court of Owls Saga, which collects the first 11 issues in one printing.

Then there's Batman: Hush by Jeph Loeb with art by Jim Lee, a personal favorite of mine, which collects the initial Hush story arc with Batman #608 through Batman #619, with an interlude from Wizard #0. Sean Murphy's Batman: White Knight is a very interesting take on the Joker I'd highly recommend, as well.

If you prefer a more superpowered hero, Grant Morrison's All-Star Superman is required reading for any comics fan. Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow by Tom King with art by Bilquis Evely is the inspiration for [James Gunn's upcoming Supergirl film](https://www.ign.com/articles/james-gunn-reveals-first-look-at-jason-momoas-lobo-in-supergirl-dc-teaser) and is one of the best depictions of the character to date. From here, I'd check out Mark Waid's and Alex Ross' Kingdom Come, a seminal Justice League tale and one of Bats' and Supes' biggest spats.

For comics outside of the traditional DC Universe, Watchmen is always a no-brainer, and it this price is definitely worth considering. Another personal favorite of mine is Scott Snyder's American Vampire with art by Rafael Albuquerque. It even has an issue penned by horror master Stephen King, and it's amazing. And for you Brian K. Vaughan fans, Y: The Last Man: Unmanned is included in the sale and collects the first 10 issues.
