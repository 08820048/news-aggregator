One of the few things everyone can agree on is that breakups suck. Romance is complicated, and even the most amicable split can be emotionally exhausting. Breakups are draining at best, and emotionally devastating at worst. Especially during this time of the year, when so many people are [celebrating love](https://www.polygon.com/valentines-day-game-movie-tv-recommendations/), dealing with a romantic split is never easy.

They say playing [_Tetris_](https://www.polygon.com/game/tetris/8504/) can help the brain process traumatic events, and while it's a great way to keep your thoughts from spiraling, sometimes you need something a little more immersive to get your mind off your ex, all the crappy things they did, and the fact that they refuse to give back your PlayStation 5.

Whether the spark fizzled out or blew up in your face, here are some games to help you get through the heartbreak.

## When you just want to be someone else for a while

## _Red Dead Redemption 2_

   ![Arthur Morgan, a cowboy, rides his horse in Red Dead Redemption 2](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/arthur-red-dead-horse.jpg?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2)

_Red Dead Redemption 2_ features an incredibly lifelike, immersive world.

In [_Red Dead Redemption 2_](https://www.polygon.com/game/red-dead-redemption-2/39461/), you are no longer a heartbroken gamer living in the 2020s. You are a badass cowboy named Arthur Morgan. The year is 1899, and the West isn't as wild as it once was. Cowboys are a dying breed, and you must protect your gang of fellow outlaws from dangers both internal and external.

The game tells a phenomenal story that's so immersive, I somehow dumped eight hours into the game in a single session the first time I booted it up. Rockstar does an excellent job of putting you into Arthur's headspace, and there is absolutely no shortage of stuff to do. Aside from following the main questline, you can also go hunting or fishing, pick up bounties, lasso your way to riches, and [try to solve](https://www.polygon.com/red-dead-redemption-2-spider-webs-puzzle-gta-6-easter-egg/) seemingly [endless mysteries](https://www.polygon.com/red-dead-redemption-2-gta-6-easter-egg-saga/).

_Red Dead Redemption 2_ also features some of the most [life-like NPCs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAqoJj3cFYk) I've ever seen in a game. They each have a unique schedule, will react to your honor status, and many will remember your previous actions. They get up, have breakfast, go to work, and care for their families in different ways at different times, and as strange as it might sound, _Red Dead Redemption 2_ is a great game for people-watching.

Just make sure you stay away from any NPCs who appear to have a cough…

## _Cyberpunk 2077_

   ![V stands in an elevator with her back facing the camera, alone. She's in a black pencil skirt and white blouse. ](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/cyberpunk-alone.png?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2)

Cyberpunk 2077 is a game about a lot of things, but isolation and self-discovery are major themes.

Similar to _Red Dead Redemption 2_, [_Cyberpunk 2077_](https://www.polygon.com/game/cyberpunk-2077/7564/) sees you walking a mile in the shoes of someone who is Not You, although you can tweak the appearance and personal background of the game's protagonist, V. V has a complicated past and an even more complicated present, which makes it easy to take your mind off your own romantic woes — V has plenty of woes of their own to handle. Some of those woes are best handled by going to a shady human chopshop to get a pair of Mantis Blades installed in your forearms and shredding enemies left and right. Other problems are best handled with care, like a potential romance with Judy, who is one of my [favorite romance companions](https://www.polygon.com/best-rpg-romance-companions-ranked/) of all time.

Whether you play _Cyberpunk_ for the combat, the story, or a combination of both, Night City is a beautiful, enthralling world that's easy to get lost in. Better still, it's a world that's easy to find yourself in. The core of the game's story is all about identity, reinventing oneself, and facing inner demons. If you've ever lost pieces of yourself due to your attachment to another person, you'll likely find _Cyberpunk 2077_ both fun to play and surprisingly cathartic.

## When you want a sense of control

   ![A field of Fall crops, as seen in Stardew Valley.](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/stardew-field.jpg?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2)

Stardew Valley is a great game for your inner micro-manager.

In addition to being a generally relaxing experience, [_Stardew Valley_](https://www.polygon.com/game/stardew-valley/38933/) is a great post-breakup game because it gives you something that, unlike your ex, you can actually fix: Pelican Town and all the people within it. From helping save the town from the encroaching corporate rot of JojaMart (unless you're doing a pro-Joja playthrough, in which case no wonder you're single) to rebuilding your grandfather's farm and, eventually, helping the residents of the town with their various personal challenges, _Stardew Valley_ is all about starting over fresh. [Solo dev ConcernedApe](https://www.polygon.com/stardew-valley-creator-regrets-haunted-chocolatier/)'s whimsical, pixielated town is full of strange plants to grow and friendships to cultivate.

_Stardew_'s marriage candidates are all pretty easy to please — shower them in their weird gift preferences and you'll be married with kids in no time. Of course, whether or not you choose to pursue romance is up to you. But you can always play house with the [game's resident sewer spirit, Krobus](https://www.polygon.com/best-rpg-romance-companions-ranked/), if you're not feeling up to traditional romance.

## _The Sims 4_

   ![A group of eight Sims stand in a line, facing the camera and making various facial expressions](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sims-4-group.jpg?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2)

Whether you want to build houses or people, The Sims 4 lets you control everything from decor to relationship dynamics.

In _The Sims 4,_ you can be — or build — whoever or whatever you want. One of the crummiest parts of going through a breakup is loss of control. Things didn't turn out how you expected them to. With the Sims, you can build a character who has a life you aspire to (or one you'd never want in a million years). Either way, control is yours, and The Sims allows you to tell whatever story you want. Bring two Sims together, assign them a messy relationship dynamic, and play out a dramatic breakup with the [_Lovestruck_ DLC pack](https://www.polygon.com/24210698/sims-4-lovestruck-player-diary-dating-romance/). Or have them build a healthy relationship without jealousy and resentment. Create a polyamorous couple. Create a single Sim whose goal isn't romance at all, but a successful career and fulfilling hobbies. Create an Alien-Sim and mind-control your neighbors. The possibilities are endless.

Whether or not you build your ex in Create-A-Sim and then delete all the pool ladders is between you and Grim, though.

## When you want romance

## _Baldur's Gate 3_

   ![Astarion, a vampire rogue, pets a white dog named Scratch](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/astarion-baldurs-gate-scratch.jpg?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2)

Baldur's Gate 3's companions are some of the best I've ever encountered when it comes to RPG romance.

[_Baldur's Gate 3_](https://www.polygon.com/baldurs-gate/) is just as immersive and enticing as _Red Dead Redemption 2_ and _The Witcher 3_, but what makes it stand out is its many romanceable companion characters. From the dramatic, clever, tragic [Astarion](https://www.polygon.com/baldurs-gate-3-hbo-series-fan-casting/) to the instantly lovable (but equally tragic) [Karlach](https://www.polygon.com/gaming/616484/karlach-baldurs-gate-3-actor-interview-samantha-beart/), _Baldur's Gate 3_'s romances go deep, [subverting overused tropes](https://www.polygon.com/bg3-baldurs-gate-3-astarion-sexy-vampire-trope/) and giving players a wide range of personalities to potentially form a bond with. (And hey, some of them are even down for a threesome, foursome, or [fivesome](https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/17eddx4/how_to_trigger_halsinastariondrow_twin_orgy/)!)

If you're currently going through that post-breakup stage where you feel too "damaged" for love, I highly recommend taking _Baldur's Gate 3_ for a spin and doing a [Dark Urge playthrough](https://www.polygon.com/baldurs-gate-3-hbo-show-dark-urge/). The Dark Urge is basically the standard player-character — you can customize everything about them, including class, race, and appearance — but with a unique backstory. That backstory is a horrific one that the Dark Urge can't remember, but as you progress through the game, you can uncover your past and give into The Urge, or resist it. Resisting The Urge while romancing a companion character leads to a bloodsoaked-yet-beautiful story of redemption, second chances, and new beginnings.

## _Date Everything!_

   ![A group image of Date Everything!'s cast of date-able household appliances.](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/date-everything-group.png?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2)

Date Everything! turns your household appliances into romantic prospects.

Image: Sassy Chap Games/Team 17

People, in many ways, kind of suck. Dating definitely sucks — dating apps are a hellscape, and it can be hard to meet people in real life. But what if you didn't have to leave your house to meet people in real life? What if your toaster was a sexy guitar player? What if your vacuum cleaner was a hunky guy named Henry Hoove? What if your [D20 was a nerdy hottie voiced by Matt Mercer](https://www.polygon.com/news/548872/date-everything-matt-mercer-chance-d20-character/)?

These are the questions _Date Everything!_ dares to ask and bravely answer, allowing you to romance the various objects in your home, who become humanized versions of themselves when you interact with them. Of course, these interactions can go south, but you have to try pretty hard to upset your household appliances. And anyone who knows what's good for them knows it's not a good idea to get on their toilet's bad side.

## When they cheated

## _Doom_

   ![Doom Eternal's monstrous, demonic enemies face off with the player, surrounded by fire.](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/doom-eternal-enemies.jpg?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2)

Sometimes you just want to shoot a bunch of demons and forget about your troubles.

Image: id Software/Bethesda Softworks

Doesn't really matter if you're playing the original, the 2016 remake, or [_Doom: Eternal_](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/3/17/21182306/doom-eternal-review-pc-xbox-one-ps4-stadia/), _Doom_ is and always has been a pleasantly straightforward way to just shoot at demons and turn your brain off. That's not an insult to the game — quite the opposite. Sometimes, when things are rough, your brain needs a break. Doom games provide fun that doesn't require a lot of focus beyond aiming.

It's also a great way to take out your anger, provided your ex hasn't stolen your damn PS5.

## _Powerwash Simulator_

   ![The player power-washes a painted wall in Powerwash Simulator 2](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/powerwash-sim-2-wall.jpg?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2)

Powerwash the pain away.

Now that you've gotten the anger out of your system, it's time to calm down. Seriously, relax. Let the oddly satisfying, [peaceful rhythm](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22463516/powerwash-simulator-review-chill-game-mechanics/) of this game wash away your stress. Become one with the power-washer. There is nothing but you and the concrete. Revel in the weirdly comforting [sequel](https://www.polygon.com/powerwash-simulator-2-review/). And then go [play some co-op titles](https://www.polygon.com/best-local-coop-games/) with your friends.

(It gets better. I got the Playstation back eventually.)
