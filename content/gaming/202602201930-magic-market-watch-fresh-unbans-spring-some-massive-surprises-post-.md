[Magic: The Gathering](https://www.ign.com/games/magic-the-gathering-trading-card-game) is in its [Lorwyn Eclipsed](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-lorwyn-eclipsed-where-to-buy-updated-2026) era, but those troublesome turtles are right around the corner at this point.

Be sure to check out [our preview of the new set](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-preview), but before the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arrive, we’ve taken a look at the current state of the market, thanks to the team at [TCGplayer](https://www.tcgplayer.com/content/article/The-Biggest-Price-Spikes-in-Magic-The-Gathering-This-Week-02-12-2026/4b84b87f-52ee-4102-b2f9-7fe435aafd4f/).

## Climbers

[![Jeweled Lotus](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/18/jeweled-lotus-1771448006107.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/a07XNl?object_uuid=36ee9818-963b-45f3-b556-cc9a8810d9e9&t=article "Jeweled Lotus")

### Jeweled Lotus

[Jeweled Lotus](https://zdcs.link/a07XNl?object_uuid=36ee9818-963b-45f3-b556-cc9a8810d9e9&t=article) kicks off our Climbers this week, and for good reason - it’s essentially doubled in price to around $75. It’s an artifact that can be sacrificed for mana to bring your Commander into play, and was expected to be unbanned… except that didn’t happen.

[![Biorhythm](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/18/biorhythm-1771448033850.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/QW6dXW?object_uuid=36ee9818-963b-45f3-b556-cc9a8810d9e9&t=article "Biorhythm")

### Biorhythm

[Biorhythm](https://zdcs.link/QW6dXW?object_uuid=36ee9818-963b-45f3-b556-cc9a8810d9e9&t=article) _was_ unbanned, though, despite being quite frankly a little scary. It swaps players’ life totals to the number of creatures they control. Play it after a board wipe that leaves you with even one creature, and you might be the only player left standing.

It’s ramped up to around $30 from being less than a third of that a few weeks ago.

[![Nurgle's Rot](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/18/nurgles-rot-1771448053739.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/Qm82vy?object_uuid=36ee9818-963b-45f3-b556-cc9a8810d9e9&t=article "Nurgle's Rot")

### Nurgle's Rot

Next up, [Nurgle’s Rot](https://zdcs.link/Qm82vy?object_uuid=36ee9818-963b-45f3-b556-cc9a8810d9e9&t=article) is from the Ruinous Powers deck from the Warhammer 40K set of precons, and it essentially gives you a stream of demons if you keep applying it to monsters you slay. It’s jumped from $2 to around $10.

[![Hancock, Ghoulish Mayor](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/18/hancock-ghoulish-mayor-1771448073229.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/9ZAdEV?object_uuid=36ee9818-963b-45f3-b556-cc9a8810d9e9&t=article "Hancock, Ghoulish Mayor")

### Hancock, Ghoulish Mayor

Sticking with crossover cards, [Hancock, Ghoulish Mayor](https://zdcs.link/9ZAdEV?object_uuid=36ee9818-963b-45f3-b556-cc9a8810d9e9&t=article) has shot from a few cents to close to two dollars. It powers up zombies and mutants on your side of the battlefield.

[![Tyvar the Bellicose](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/18/tyvar-the-bellicose-1771448098943.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/aN3D1G?object_uuid=36ee9818-963b-45f3-b556-cc9a8810d9e9&t=article "Tyvar the Bellicose")

### Tyvar the Bellicose

[Tyvar the Bellicose](https://zdcs.link/aN3D1G?object_uuid=36ee9818-963b-45f3-b556-cc9a8810d9e9&t=article) is our last climber, and it owes it all to more Elven synergy in Lorwyn Eclipsed. The card is now worth around double what it was two weeks ago, sitting around $18 at the time of writing. Tyvar gives your Elves deathtouch when attacking, and bulks up your board with mana abilities. Oh, and it’s a 5/4 for good measure.

## Crashers

[![Stoneforge Mystic](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/18/stoneforge-mystic-1771448110614.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/9l8wMR?object_uuid=36ee9818-963b-45f3-b556-cc9a8810d9e9&t=article "Stoneforge Mystic")

### Stoneforge Mystic

[Stoneforge Mystic](https://zdcs.link/9l8wMR?object_uuid=36ee9818-963b-45f3-b556-cc9a8810d9e9&t=article) is a big part of equipment decks that can host White cards, and for good reason. This two-cost card lets you grab an equipment card from your deck and put it in your hand, and then an activated ability can put it into play.

It’s not cheap, but it is down to $28. It was over $35 not long ago, and it makes a great option for equipment decks like Limit Break or Scrappy Survivors.

[![Moonshadow](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/18/moonshadow-1771448299329.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/Qd8dNj?object_uuid=36ee9818-963b-45f3-b556-cc9a8810d9e9&t=article "Moonshadow")

### Moonshadow

[Moonshadow](https://zdcs.link/Qd8dNj?object_uuid=36ee9818-963b-45f3-b556-cc9a8810d9e9&t=article) has some of my favorite art in Lorwyn Eclipsed, and it’s down to $18, having been north of $20 around launch.

It’s a 7/7 that arrives with six -1/-1 counters on it, and powers up as permanents are put into the graveyard.

[![Teval, the Balanced Scale](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/18/teval-the-balanced-scale-1771448285027.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/aB81lN?object_uuid=36ee9818-963b-45f3-b556-cc9a8810d9e9&t=article "Teval, the Balanced Scale")

### Teval, the Balanced Scale

[Teval, the Balanced Scale](https://zdcs.link/aB81lN?object_uuid=36ee9818-963b-45f3-b556-cc9a8810d9e9&t=article) helms the Sultai Arisen precon from Tarkir Dragonstorm, and can be picked up for as low as $3 right now for its full-art treatment. Whenever it attacks, mill cards and then get a land from your graveyard, therefore triggering the creation of a 2/2 token creature.

[![Doran, Besieged by Time](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/18/doran-besieged-by-time-1771448260190.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/aMKvGk?object_uuid=36ee9818-963b-45f3-b556-cc9a8810d9e9&t=article "Doran, Besieged by Time")

### Doran, Besieged by Time

[Doran, Besieged by Time](https://zdcs.link/aMKvGk?object_uuid=36ee9818-963b-45f3-b556-cc9a8810d9e9&t=article) is a fun ‘toughness matters’ card from Lorwyn Eclipsed. It’s a 0/5, and makes creatures with more toughness than power cheaper to cast. Then, whenever a creature attacks or blocks, it gets +X/+X until the end of turn, where X is the difference between the two.

It’s being sold for as little as a dollar right now, and you it’ll slot handily into the Abzan Armor precon.

[![Colossal Grave-Reaver](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/18/colossal-grave-reaver-1771448237026.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/9gX3e8?object_uuid=36ee9818-963b-45f3-b556-cc9a8810d9e9&t=article "Colossal Grave-Reaver")

### Colossal Grave-Reaver

[Colossal Grave-Reaver](https://zdcs.link/9gX3e8?object_uuid=36ee9818-963b-45f3-b556-cc9a8810d9e9&t=article) is a personal favorite card of mine, just because it’s frankly ridiculous if you can get it online.

Now up to $7 from $4 at the end of 2025, it’s a 7/6 dragon that mills cards and can put a creature into play from the graveyard.

## The Best MTG Sealed Product Deals Today

The new [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles set](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-where-to-buy-updated-2026) arrives next month (with prerelease even sooner), but Amazon isn’t waiting to drop the price of booster boxes.

After some price fluctuations, the retailer has finally confirmed that the [TMNT Play Booster Box will be sold for $125.99](https://zdcs.link/aB8dVV?object_uuid=36ee9818-963b-45f3-b556-cc9a8810d9e9&t=article), which is only a dollar more than its all-time lowest price of $124.99 that we saw [a few weeks ago](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtle-preorders-drop-to-new-record-low-price-amazon-just-weeks-after-last-discount) as a sale item.

[![TMNT Play Booster Box](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/18/81gb1b4mnzl-ac-sl1500-1771424807930.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/aB8dVV?object_uuid=36ee9818-963b-45f3-b556-cc9a8810d9e9&t=article "TMNT Play Booster Box")

### TMNT Play Booster Box

With 30 packs per box of Play Boosters, you’re getting each one for $4.19, a discount that adds up and should give you a sizeable collection of TMNT cards right from the jump.

As a reminder, the set’s rarest alternative treatments will more likely be found in Collector Boosters (more on those in a moment), but Amazon setting this price means it should be relatively easy to get up to speed and build something playable for your next Magic night.
