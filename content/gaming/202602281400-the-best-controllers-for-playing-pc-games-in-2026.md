No matter how much you may prefer a [mouse](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-mouse) and [keyboard](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-keyboard) for PC gaming, some games and genres are just built with gamepads in mind – and play much better with one as a result. That's why I've tested dozens of controllers during my PC-centric career, and why I feel confident in recommending the nine picks below. Whether you're looking for something simple and inexpensive for occasional use, or something more advanced for competitive or accessible play, you should find at least one great option here.

## TL;DR – These Are the Best PC Controllers:

## 1\. Xbox Core Controller

### Best PC Controller

[![Core Controller](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/11/14/screen-shot-2022-11-14-at-8-31-53-am-1668443527665.png?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/OXRDE?object_uuid=8135bb53-90ac-4674-9b25-131f59936441&t=article "Core Controller")

Our Top Pick

### Xbox Core Controller

Enjoy the familiar Xbox layout on an ergonomic controller with remappable buttons, a tactile D-pad, and ample connectivity options.

Product Specifications

Connectivity

Wireless, Bluetooth

Weight

15.2 ounces

Features

D-pad, Share button, textured grip, custom button mapping

Battery

2x AA

PROS

Feels good in your hands with improved textured grips

Impulse triggers add more depth in supported games

Default target for developers implementing gamepad support

CONS

Battery powered and requires an add-on to use rechargeable batteries

Although the Xbox Core Controller doesn’t necessarily revolutionize the standard Xbox controller we once knew and loved, it does offer some necessary updates that PC gamers will appreciate, which we’ve highlighted in [our Xbox Core Controller review](https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-x-controller-review). The new cosmetics are a nice touch; the all-black Xbox button, for instance, matte bumpers and triggers, and an overall more comfortable design. There are also [a ton of Xbox controller colors](https://www.ign.com/articles/all-xbox-controller-colors-in-order) to choose from.

The controller's hybrid D-pad is extra responsive and allows for an easier distinction between the cardinal and diagonal inputs, which is ideal for those who love fighting games. Of course, the rest of the buttons and sticks remain reliable and consistent, and the textured grip on the triggers, bumpers, and back case keep the controller in hand even during heated moments. All of these improvements mean a new level of precision and control. There’s also now a dedicated Share button that makes capturing screenshots and video clips a breeze.

Many of the Xbox Core Controller’s buttons, triggers, and sticks can be customized via the Xbox Accessories app when downloaded from the Microsoft Store on PC, and you can save profiles to avoid the hassle every time you switch games. Remapping can also be done using Steam; however, there will be more limitations than when using an Xbox Series X|S. Connecting to a PC is simple, as USB-C support provides a plug-and-play solution. For wireless connectivity, Bluetooth is available or Xbox Wireless via a dongle with supported devices. The Core Controller's biggest flaw is that it uses AA batteries; you can shell out some extra dough for a rechargeable battery pack.

## 2\. PowerA Advantage Wired Controller

### Best Budget PC Controller

[![Advantage Wired Controller for Xbox Series X|S](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/25/screenshot-2025-09-25-at-6-33-53-pm-1758839645243.png?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/a5XGJY?object_uuid=8135bb53-90ac-4674-9b25-131f59936441&t=article "Advantage Wired Controller for Xbox Series X|S")

### PowerA Advantage Wired Controller for Xbox Series X|S

Grab this wired gamepad to save money while still getting all the inputs you need, plus vibration motors, trigger locks, and two small buttons on its underside for shortcuts.

Product Specifications

Connectivity

Wired

Weight

7.2 ounces

Features

Dual rumble motors, mappable buttons, trigger stops

Battery

N/A

PROS

Three-level trigger stop switches

Two shortcut buttons on backside of controller

Upgraded 10ft USB-C cable with this model

CONS

Thumbsticks may be too tight for some

Still wired only

During our [hands-on testing of the PowerA Enhanced](https://www.ign.com/articles/powera-enhanced-wired-controller-for-xbox-series-xs-review) wired controller, we found it to be an excellent and affordable PC controller option. PowerA’s updated model, the Advantage, makes some meaningful improvements without increasing the price tag. It comes with a removable 10-foot USB-C cable, a significant upgrade from the MicroUSB on the Enhanced model, for seamless PC connection. Unfortunately, wireless and Bluetooth connectivity are still excluded from this budget gamepad, but you do get a 3.5mm jack to plug in a [great gaming headset](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-headset).

The PowerA Advantage sticks to the familiar shape and feel of the Xbox Core Controller, featuring all the typical Xbox controls, even taking a page out of the Xbox Elite Controller’s book with two small, easy-to-reach buttons on the underside for shortcuts; it’s slightly less robust, but still punches far above its price class. The backside of the grips feature a slight texture, although it’s not enough to add significantly more control like rubberized grips can. Dual rumble motors and impulse triggers are even available for better immersion. And don’t worry, they’re accurate and subtle.

What makes this controller a true standout is the three-level trigger stop switches, which are not available on the PowerA Enhanced model and are a rarity in controllers of this price range. It's a boon for fans of FPS games who want to step away from the mouse and keyboard occasionally without shelling out tons of dough for a pro-level controller. The thumbsticks are shorter and feature a good amount of tension. While those sticks are great for precision, the extra force required can be a hindrance in certain games. The rest of the buttons are responsive and reliable, putting it on the level of a first-party controller.

## 3\. Hyperkin Competitor

### Best Wired PC Controller

[![Competitor](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/com-1764171962555.png?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/9wjp3R?object_uuid=8135bb53-90ac-4674-9b25-131f59936441&t=article "Competitor")

### Hyperkin Competitor

If you prefer a PlayStation style layout, this wired controller offers long-lasting Hall Effect sticks, Impulse triggers and pro-style rear buttons.

Product Specifications

Connectivity

Wired

Weight

0.52 pounds

Features

Symmetric layout, Hall Effect sticks, Impulse triggers, rear buttons

PROS

Well-built DualSense-style design with symmetric sticks

Customizable back buttons

Hall Effect sticks last longer and have smaller deadzones

CONS

Not everyone prefers a PlayStation-style layout

A little expensive for a wired controller

In our hands-on [review of the Hyperkin Competitor](https://www.ign.com/articles/hyperkin-competitor-xbox-and-pc-controller-review), we found it offered a convincing simulcrum of the Sony DualSense controller for PC and Xbox, with PlayStation-style symmetrical sticks, a similar black-and-white color scheme and upgraded internals. That includes Hall Effect sensors under each thumbstick and trigger, which boost durability and aid precision with smaller deadzones. The sticks themselves are particularly worthy of praise, with anti-friction rings and metal stems that produce a fluid, linear feel, though it is a touch light in comparison to the console controller it emulates.

In terms of pro-level features, the stand-out is the inclusion of two rear buttons, mapped to A and B by default. These are placed directly where your middle fingers can actuate them, with locks nearby to prevent accidental presses if you're not using them and a mapping button to reassign them.

The Competitor feels quite light and is made of plastic, but it's still reasonably well-constructed given its middling price. The rear grips have a fine texture to them, preventing them from sliding out of slightly sweaty hands, the D-pad feels bouncier than the DualSense's, and the face buttons are a bit small but responsive. Neither too wide nor too narrow, most hand sizes are accommodated here (something you couldn't say about the [Xbox Duke remake Hyperkin is also responsible for](https://www.ign.com/articles/hyperkin-duke-xbox-controller-20th-anniversary)).

The Competitor sits at an interesting place in the market, coming in around the same price as a first-party controller from Xbox or PlayStation, while offering some advantages (HE sticks, rear buttons) and some disadvantages (wired connectivity and a slightly toy-like feel). Overall though, it does enough right to earn the nod.

## 4\. Asus ROG Raikiri II

### Best TMR Controller for PC

[![Asus ROG Raikiri II](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/raikiri-square-1772229366512.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/aR7nvy?object_uuid=8135bb53-90ac-4674-9b25-131f59936441&t=article "Asus ROG Raikiri II")

### Asus ROG Raikiri II

The sequel to the original Raikiri controller from Asus brings TMR sensors and heavy inspiration from the ROG Xbox Ally X. It's pretty neat.

Product Specifications

Connectivity

Wireless, Bluetooth, USB-C

Weight

345g

Features

TMR analog sticks and triggers, Tri-Mode connectivity, Carrying case

Battery

Up to 20 hours

PROS

Accurate and reliable analog sticks

Beautiful RGB lighting

Powerful vibration

CONS

Two of the buttons are pointless if you don't have an Xbox Ally

The Asus ROG Raikiri II might have '2' in its name, but it's such a far departure from the original that it feels like it exists on its own. Rather than taking the design language from the first iteration, the Raikiri is instead more inspired by the [ROG Xbox Ally X](https://www.ign.com/articles/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review) – Asus's latest handheld gaming PC – to an almost ridiculous degree.

The controller has the same button layout with the Library and Armoury Crate buttons located on top of the menu buttons in the middle of the gamepad. When connected to the Xbox Ally X, these serve to give you the same exact experience on your TV as you're used to in handheld mode. For some reason, they don't do anything when they're connected to a regular old gaming PC. I even tried downloading Asus' software to see if that would make them magically start working to no avail.

But even with a couple of pointless buttons in the middle, the Raikiri II is an amazing controller. [When we reviewed it, Jackie Thomas praised the analog sticks,](https://www.ign.com/articles/asus-rog-raikiri-ii-controller-review) which use TMR (tunneling magneto-resistance) sensors, to be more accurate for a longer period of time. This kind of sensor is basically the same concept as Hall Effect, using magnets to more accurately track movement, but because there are fewer moving parts, a TMR sensor will wear down much more slowly over time.

These sensors are also in the triggers, which makes them feel incredibly accurate, especially in games where having pressure-sensitive triggers actually matters – think games like Forza Horizon 5.

The only other real downside is the high price, but Asus has put a lot of work into making sure this controller will last a _long_ time, so it's worth the extra investment.

## 5\. Sony DualSense Controller

### Best PC Controller for PlayStation Games

[![DualSense Controller](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/06/04/612bjwbuobs-sl1500-1622825179207.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/924xd1?object_uuid=8135bb53-90ac-4674-9b25-131f59936441&t=article "DualSense Controller")

### Sony DualSense Controller

The DualSense is comfortable to grip and offers impressive haptics and adaptive triggers for more immersion in the action.

Product Specifications

Connectivity

Wireless, Bluetooth

Weight

1.76 ounces

Features

Haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, built-in microphone

Battery

Up to 12 hours

PROS

Great haptic feedback

Tactile buttons and d-pad

Impressive adaptive triggers can mimic weapons in game

Sturdy, easy-to-grip build

CONS

Some features only work with wired connection

Mediocre battery life

We spent a lot of time [reviewing the Sony DualSense Controller](https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-dualsense-controller-review), and it's another great first-party option for PC, whether you connect it with a cable or via Bluetooth. It's particular niche is playing PS5 ports that support its Adaptive Triggers, which add surprisingly amounts of granularity to the experience. If you're a fan of the output of Sony's game studios, then this might be what sways you to choosing the DualSense over the Xbox Core controller. And unlike the Xbox Core, there’s a rechargeable battery for wireless use, though it's relatively limited at around 10-13 hours during our testing.

As you might be aware, the DualSense was made for the PS5 and continues the company's tradition of opting for symmetrical analog sticks, like the Hyperkin Competitor above. Unlike the Competitor though, this gamepad feels a bit better heavier and better built, while remaining balanced, easy to grip, and ultimately more ergonomic. There are also plenty of [DualSense color options available](https://www.ign.com/articles/all-ps5-dualsense-colors-in-order) if you don't like the standard look.

With [handy support from Steam](https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5s-dualsense-is-now-supported-in-steam-client-beta) as well as fan-made software packages, plus increasing numbers of PlayStation-exclusive games ending up not so exclusive thanks to PC ports, full DualSense functionality on PC makes for the best way to play those games.

## 6\. Xbox Elite Series 2 Controller

### Best High-End PC Controller

[![Elite Series 2 Controller](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/06/04/chrome-5riugm0u9h-1622827528562.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/JyBbq?object_uuid=8135bb53-90ac-4674-9b25-131f59936441&t=article "Elite Series 2 Controller")

### Xbox Elite Series 2 Controller

Get ample customizability on this high-end controller with a swappable controls, tunable triggers, extra rear paddles, and fully remappable buttons.

Product Specifications

Connectivity

Wireless, Bluetooth

Weight

12.16 ounces

Features

Adjustable tension thumbsticks, rubberized grip, custom profiles, custom button mapping

Battery

Up to 40 hours

PROS

Magnetically swappable D-pad, back paddles, and analog sticks

Up to a 40 hour battery life

Reliable tunable hair triggers

Fully remappable buttons

CONS

Mushy ABXY buttons

If you're after a controller that offers the familiar Xbox design but amps up its capability, our [review of the Xbox Elite Series 2 controller](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/15/xbox-elite-wireless-series-2-controller-review) shows you why it's perfect for your needs. This model features four rear paddles that can have their own actions or can change the function of the face buttons. Plus, all of the buttons on the gamepad are remappable. The D-pad, back paddles, and analog sticks are magnetically swappable for added customization, ensuring the controller feels exactly how you want. Xbox also kept the tunable triggers from the original Elite.

While all of these features sound great on paper, they deliver in real life, too — for the most part. Swapping out sticks and D-pads is easy and helped improve the feel for our reviewer in certain genres, like platformers or fighting games. Setting up hair triggers kept reaction times on point in shooters. The rear paddles may take a minute to master, but are poppy and responsive. However, they don’t make up for the mushy ABXY buttons, which are a major disappointment for such a premium controller.

At least the Elite Series 2 controller adds the rechargeable battery that the Xbox Core controller lacks, and lasts an impressive 40 hours on each charge. In addition to Xbox Wireless when using an adapter with PC, Bluetooth is available for easy pairing with your PC or smartphone. A low-latency wired connection via USB-C is also supported.

## 7\. Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra

### Best Customizable PC Controller

[![Stealth Ultra](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/12/12/screenshot-2023-12-12-at-8-40-43-am-1702388452395.png?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/Xon4W?object_uuid=8135bb53-90ac-4674-9b25-131f59936441&t=article "Stealth Ultra")

### Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra

A display for setting adjustments and notifications, alongside Hall Effect sticks, tactile switches, and extra mappable buttons, makes this controller a stand-out.

Product Specifications

Connectivity

Wireless, Bluetooth

Weight

0.54 pounds

Features

Charging dock, tactile microswitches, AntiDrift thumbsticks, customizable buttons and triggers

Battery

Up to 30 hours

PROS

“Connected Command Display” for on the fly adjustments and notifications

Tactile micro switches

Hall Effect sensors on the sticks

Extremely customizable

CONS

Buggy PC software

One of the most enticing things we found in [our review of the Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra](https://www.ign.com/articles/turtle-beach-stealth-ultra-review) is its unique “Connected Command Display.” It’s a compact, full-color screen directly on the controller that displays phone notifications and allows on-the-fly setting adjustments, like swapping between 10 different profiles, fine-tuning the vibration intensity, and modifying RGB lighting, which can even change colors to indicate phone notification alerts or a low battery.

The Stealth Ultra features some slightly buggy software that works with a PC to provide a full suite of options for tuning the controller and creating profiles for specific games or desired feels. Everything from joystick and trigger deadzones to joystick response curves and rear paddle button mapping can be done with this software.

Turtle Beach’s offering is wireless, so there’s a 2.4GHz dongle for a lag-free connection to your PC or Xbox. Bluetooth support is handy for your gaming phone. However, when you start experimenting with the display and RGB lighting, the advertised 30-hour battery life quickly drops to around 10 hours.

While all the customizability is great (and honestly overkill), real-world performance is what matters, and the Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra is one beast of a gamepad. It features an Xbox layout with tactile micro switches that are sharp and precise, which proved helpful in Dead Cells during testing, where the button timing was flawless. While drifting has plagued other Turtle Beach controllers, the Hall Effect sensors on the sticks prevent drifting and provide nuanced control. The trigger toggle even helped cut milliseconds of crucial time in FPS.

## 8\. Razer Kitsune

### Best PC Fight Stick

[![Kitsune](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/09/13/screen-shot-2023-09-13-at-11-22-33-am-1694618582436.png?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/ynrlJ?object_uuid=8135bb53-90ac-4674-9b25-131f59936441&t=article "Kitsune")

### Razer Kitsune

Go for a leverless design with this fight stick that has everything you need to KO opponents at tournaments.

Product Specifications

Connectivity

Wired

Weight

1.7 pounds

Features

Low-profile Linear Optical switches, RGB lighting, Quad Movement button layout

Battery

N/A

PROS

Fast, reliable, and consistently accurate optical switches

Hot-swappable controls

Sturdy, durable build

CONS

Leverless design takes some getting used to

If you play a good deal of arcade or fighting games, do yourself a favor and pick up a [great fight stick](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-fight-stick), and for PC, the [Razer Kitsune we've reviewed](https://www.ign.com/articles/razer-kitsune-review) is a standout option. Rather than including a typical stick on the controller, it has a leverless design offering buttons that move in a full range of directions. Admittedly, there’s a bit of a learning curve to master the Kitsune, but the quicker input speed (milliseconds matter in fighting games), improved accuracy, and easier execution of certain moves are worth the effort to KO opponents.

The Kitsune is a PlayStation-licensed device, so beyond directional controls are the essential PlayStation buttons. Razer opted to use optical switches on this fight stick, and in testing, inputs were fast and reliable while remaining surprisingly quiet, but still delivering a keyboard-like feel. While those buttons offer a distinct feel, the controls are hot-swappable to easily customize the board to your liking.

Like any good fight stick, the Razer Kitsune is sturdy, durable, and large enough to let both hands rest comfortably on it with the buttons perfectly spaced. On top is a removable aluminum plate to add your own flair to the controller, and the bottom features a nice grip, ensuring it stays in place during heated moments. It does all of this while remaining light enough to carry around to tournaments, weighing under 2lbs. Razer also includes a flashy light strip around the edge of the controller and a tournament lock to prevent you from accidentally getting disqualified. Even if it’s designed for the PS5, this controller works flawlessly with PC and seamlessly connects via a USB.

## 9\. Logitech G Pro Wheel and Pedals

### Best PC Racing Wheel

[![Pro Racing Wheel and Pedals](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/61rjlvjh2l-1764165451483.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/a5XgK8?object_uuid=8135bb53-90ac-4674-9b25-131f59936441&t=article "Pro Racing Wheel and Pedals")

### Logitech G Pro Racing Wheel and Pedals

Logitech's Pro Racing Wheel and Pedals offer powerful and accurate feedback, with good support amongst major racing titles, and a growing ecosystem of rims, shifters and other accessories.

Product Specifications

Connectivity

Wired

Weight

18.7 pounds (base + rim)

Features

TrueForce feedback, 11Nm torque, adjustable and upgradeable

PROS

Strong 11Nm motor with TrueForce

Three pedals, with load cell brake

Available in PC, Xbox/PC and PlayStation/PC variants

CONS

Expensive, though the PC-only version is cheapest and bundles exist

TrueForce isn't supported in all games

Anyone into sim racing on PC needs a [great racing wheel](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-racing-wheels) for a deeper level of immersion, and Logitech's Pro Racing Wheel and Pedals are an awesome option – even if they do cost a little over $1,000. As the name suggests, this direct drive motor connects directly to the steering wheel, providing much better control and force feedback than gear or belt-driven alternatives. The system delivers up to 11Nm of torque, which is plenty to feel acccurate feedback about the road surface and how well your tires are gripping it.

You also get additional colour through the wheel in games that support Logitech's TrueForce feature, which adds an extra dimension of telemetry-based feedback beyond what's possible through standard DirectInput. It's also easy to reduce the strength of the force feedback via the Logitech G app or the wheel itself, which has an integrated display and controls to adjust this and many other settings.

The Pro Racing Wheel is available in PC-only, PC/Xbox and PC/PlayStation varieties, with the PC option costing $100 less than the two consoles models. The button layout doesn't change between each model, just the labels, and I found the buttons well-placed and satisfying to push, even while wearing gloves. The 300mm rim is also well-sized, with a slight D-shape that's fine to use for all genres of racing, though rally and drift enthusiasts might prefer to fit the RS Wheel Hub and the RS Round Wheel, while Formula racers have the option of the RS Track Wheel. On the default wheel, the magnetic shifters provide suitably clunky feedback, with dual analogue paddles that are ideal for clutches or handbrakes.

The Racing Pro Pedals are built to the same high quality standard, with the three-item set including a clutch, brake and throttle. The highlight is the brake, which uses a load cell to measure how hard you're hitting it, rather than how far down it's been pressed. This feels more similar to a real race car, and can help you brake more consistently to ultimately improve your lap times. All three pedals are adjustable, though the dialling in the feel of the brake is the most important.

If you're investing this much into a wheel and pedals, then hard-mounting to a rig like the Logitech x Playseat Trophy makes a lot of sense, and I really enjoyed the stability and portability this provided. However, it's also possible to mount the wheel to a desk, which works well enough if you can prevent the pedals for slipping backwards and may be preferable to a fixed setup for some use cases.

Overall, the Logitech G Pro Racing Wheel and Pro Racing Pedals are tremendously powerful pieces of kit that continue to improve as new accessories are released and more games are supported.

## 10\. Xbox Adaptive Controller

### Best Accessible PC Controller

[![Adaptive Controller](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/10/18/xbox-adaptive-controller-blogroll-1666819937356-1697643026957.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/9gj3eq?object_uuid=8135bb53-90ac-4674-9b25-131f59936441&t=article "Adaptive Controller")

### Xbox Adaptive Controller

Inclusive input device with two large buttons, a D-pad, and more.

Product Specifications

Connectivity

Wired, Xbox Wireless

Weight

1.22 pounds

Features

19 3.5mm ports, 2 large buttons, D-pad, 2 USB 2.0

Battery

Up to 25 hours

PROS

High customizability and modularity

19 3.5mm jacks for foot pedals, switches, joysticks, and other other adaptability aids

A few helpful built-in controls

CONS

High cost for controller and necessary peripherals

Certain simultaneous inputs may not be supported

The Xbox Adaptive Controller was an innovative controller when it was released back in 2018, and it’s still great today. Unfortunately, the accessible controller market is relatively small, with most top options coming at a premium; that doesn't even include all the necessary peripherals required to make the controller work for your specific needs. While the Xbox Adaptive Controller isn’t cheap by any means, its inclusive, simple-to-use design and compatibility with PC continue to push it above others.

Rather than a typical gamepad, the Adaptive Controller is more of an input hub with a body similar to a fightstick. Its extreme modularity and customizability allow the controller to be adapted for specific abilities. The built-in controls are limited, but it still features two massive remappable buttons on its face, along with a D-pad, view button, and home button.

However, the reason you’ll want the Adaptive Controllers is for the excess of inputs. 19 3.5mm jacks correspond with all the typical controller inputs, including bumpers and triggers, allowing foot pedals, switches, joysticks, and other adaptability aids to be added. I’d recommend picking up the [Xbox Adaptive Joystick](https://zdcs.link/9YMdkm?object_uuid=8135bb53-90ac-4674-9b25-131f59936441&t=article), which includes the stick, four buttons, and a mounting thread. While it adds $30 to the price tag, the buttons can be remapped, ergonomics are solid, and 3D-printable thumbstick toppers are supported. The joystick can also plug into a standard Xbox controller.

The Xbox Adaptive Controller is an invaluable tool for accessibility, but that doesn’t mean it’s flawless. The learning curve is steep when mastering all the different controls, and sometimes simultaneous inputs aren’t supported, leading to limitations in games. The biggest downfall is the cost of all the extra peripherals required to make this functional controller, but it does support third-party options. Still, gamers have reported that, for the most part, this controller works great, allowing them to play games that weren’t always feasible.

## How to Choose the Best PC Controller

Choosing the best PC controller for gaming can seem daunting, especially given the excess of options available. However, it’s easier to nail down the right choice by assessing what kind of gamer you are, what types of games you play, and whether you want to use your controller across other devices.

### **Sticks and triggers**

While almost all classic controllers use potentiometers to sense when a thumbstick has been moved or a trigger has been depressed, many modern options now use more advanced HE (Hall Effect) or TMR (Tunneling Magnetoresistance) magnetic sensors instead. These tend to be more expensive than potentiometers to include in a controller, but they allow for more precision, in the form of smaller deadzones. These technologies also tend to offer better long-term durability, with fewer physically interacting parts, helping prevent stick drift. HE sensors typically require more power than potentiometers, potentially reducing battery life in wireless controllers, while TMR sensors are more power-efficient than either option. However, implementation by manufacturers also matters, so while TMR and HE sticks and triggers are worth looking for, they're not a guarantee of a good-quality experience.

### **Ergonomics**

One of the biggest factors to consider is the ergonomics and comfort of the controller. Since you'll likely be using it for extended gaming sessions, it's crucial to pick a controller that feels comfortable. Look for controllers with well-placed buttons, responsive triggers, and a shape that fits naturally in your hands. Beyond that, grips can be important in games that require extra control.

### **Controller type**

Think about the types of games you'll be playing. Different genres may benefit from specific controller designs. For instance, if you're into racing or flying simulators, a controller with analog sticks and precise triggers might be ideal. On the other hand, if you're primarily playing fighting or platformer games, a controller with a good D-pad and responsive face buttons could be more suitable. Playing a lot of FPS games: a gamepad with adjustable triggers and a tighter stick will make for quicker reactions and better control. Of course, if you’ve got the budget, you can also grab specified controllers for certain games, like racing wheels, [PC joysticks](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pc-joystick), and fightsticks.

### **Compatibility**

While the majority of controllers are designed to work seamlessly with Windows PCs, it's always a good idea to double-check compatibility with your specific gaming setup. If a controller offers a wired connection via USB, using it with a PC should be relatively simple. Oftentimes, there will also be software that allows for button remapping and other customizations.

Wireless controllers may be trickier. Most come with Bluetooth support, which makes them [great phone controllers](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-phone-controller). However, a good deal of latency is often introduced. Sometimes wireless controllers offer a 2.4Ghz USB dongle to plug into PCs for a faster and more stable connection; if you're a competitive gamer, this is the way to go. Luckily, most wireless offerings come with the option for a wired connection.

### **Features and customizations**

Don't forget to consider additional features and extras. Many controllers come with programmable buttons, vibration feedback, or even customizable lighting effects. Adaptive triggers are a boon in FPS or sensory-focused games. Some higher-end controllers even come with swappable controls and a degree of modularity to adjust the feel for certain games. While these features may not be essential, they can enhance your gaming experience and provide added value for your money.

### **Cost**

Perhaps the biggest factor in choosing a PC controller is cost. If your controller will only be used occasionally, since you’re more of a mouse and keyboard hero, a budget controller is perfectly suitable. Expect to find some great options in the $30 to $60 range. Upping the budget slightly to somewhere between $60 and $100 will bring a great balance of features, comfort, and quality. Stick to this price if you're more of a casual player. Anything above $100 should bring awesome customizability and durability; competitive players should expect to shell out a bit more for a high-end, reliable controller.

## What's next in the world of PC controllers?

We recently went [hands-on with the upcoming Steam Controller](https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-controller-preview-hands-on-with-valves-reinvented-pc-gaming-controller), which is slated to launch alongside the Steam Machine sometime in the next few months. Alongside a suite of modern controller features, such as TMR sticks, programmable back buttons, and HD haptics, the Steam Controller carries a number of rare or unique features, namely gyroscopic motion controls and a pair of capacitive touchpads that make it easier to control mouse inputs on PC. These features set the Steam Controller up as uniquely qualified among controllers for PC, and we're looking forward to testing it out when it launches later this year. In the meantime, check out our [interview with Valve](https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-next-gen-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-the-big-interview) about it and the Steam Machine.

## PC Controller FAQ

### Is PC gaming better with a controller?

Compared to a keyboard and mouse, some gamers opt to use a controller. However, it comes down to your personal preferences, as each of these input devices has its own advantages and disadvantages.

A keyboard and mouse combo will be much larger and more spread out than a controller, which means you’ll need a [great gaming desk](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-desk) or [reliable lap desk](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-lapdesks) to use them successfully. But thanks to a larger size, there is a wealth of inputs that a typical controller just can’t offer. Many of the keys and buttons are customizable with secondary functions. When gaming, keyboards and mice usually pull ahead in precision, accuracy, and responsiveness, which is especially beneficial to competitive players.

Now, don’t get me wrong, controllers are equally great. They are much smaller and more ergonomic than a mouse and keyboard, making all the inputs easy to reach. Great controllers will also have customizable or remappable buttons and triggers. The analog sticks bring smoother control over certain movements, and with some controllers offering a dose of haptic feedback, gaming can be more immersive.

Ultimately, it tends to depend on the game. Many titles are designed with one input method or the other in mind, so having the flexibility of a good controller to hand is frequently useful.

### Do all controllers work with PCs?

While not every controller is guaranteed to work with PC, almost all current controllers are supported in some way. Xbox controllers are your best bet for native compatibility. Whether it's connected via wired USB, Bluetooth, or Xbox Wireless (with adapter), the devices should be instantly detected by either Windows or Steam. With the Xbox Accessories app, remapping, vibrations, and more should be supported. Be sure to check out our guide on [how to pair an Xbox controller to PC](https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-pair-xbox-controller-to-pc) for even more info.

The latest PlayStation 5 controllers are another safe bet when it comes to compatibility with PC, especially when you connect using a wired USB or Bluetooth. You can always grab a [great Bluetooth adapter for your PC](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-bluetooth-adapters-for-pc) if your PC doesn’t support it. Steam and the majority of modern games recognize PlayStation gamepads, allowing for button remapping and other customizations. However, adaptive triggers and haptics will only work with certain games. Still, for the most part, a [PS5 controller pairs seemlessly with PC](https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-pair-ps5-controller-to-pc).

Third-party controller brands, like Turtle Beach, Razer, and PowerA, should also be completely compatible with PC and recognized by Steam if not Windows. These devices connect either using a wired USB connection or wirelessly via Bluetooth or a 2.4Ghz USB dongle. Now, not all the controllers' features may necessarily work with PCs, but you should have no problem with basic controls.

Of course, it’s always good to check that a controller supports PC and what limitations it may have when used with PC before purchasing. All the ones I’ve selected for this guide will make a great addition to your PC battlestation.

### Can you play any PC game with a controller?

Not all PC games are designed to work well with a controller. If you’re playing games on Steam, you can visit the store page to see if the game is compatible with a controller before buying the game. However, other platforms, such as Epic Games, do not list if the game is compatible with a controller, but you can often find out which games support a controller with a quick Google search. The PCGamingWiki is another great resource for checking what input methods PC games support, including fan-made fixes where relevant.
