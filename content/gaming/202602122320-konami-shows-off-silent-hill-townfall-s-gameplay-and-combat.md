For the first time since it was unveiled via a teaser trailer in 2022, players are finally getting a closer look at _Silent Hill: Townfall_. The game is a Silent Hill spin-off and the last of the [five Silent Hill projects Konami announced](https://www.polygon.com/23413553/silent-hill-townfall-konami-annapurna-interactive-no-code/) in 2022 (including the [_Silent Hill 2_](https://www.polygon.com/game/silent-hill-2-2024/467108/) remake, [_Silent Hill f_](https://www.polygon.com/game/silent-hill-f/539708/), the interactive streaming series [_Silent Hill: Ascension_](https://www.polygon.com/23919887/silent-hill-ascension-release-date-where-to-watch/), and Christophe Gans' recently released [_Return to Silent Hill_](https://www.polygon.com/return-to-silent-hill-destroys-three-characters-angela/) film).

Revealed during [Sony's State of Play](https://www.polygon.com/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-playstation/) the trailer picks up where the initial 2022 teaser left off, with a crackling radio sitting on a desk. The radio is picked up by a man in glasses who, curiously, appears to have some sort of IV drip attached to the back of his hand.

"Simon, listen to me," a female voice says over the radio. "You can't stay in this room forever. I can't stay in this room forever. I know this is going to be hard, but you havte to come back to me."

Simon then awakens in a foggy town, dragging himself out of a lake or river and stating that he "woke up in the water again."

A nearby sign reveals that he's in a place called St. Amelia. A sign on one of the doors in town reads, "Nothing we can do until help arrives, please stay safe." The town is littered with protest signs and other evidence of social unrest, and the female voice returns, telling Simon he "did what he did."

The trailer also provides the very first look at _Townfall_'s gameplay. Combat is first-person, where Simon can be seen using his radio to deduce the location of enemies and fighting them off with a plank of wood and later, a pistol.

The game is being developed by [_Observation_](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/5/21/18632969/observation-review-pc-ps4-epic-games-store/) developer Screen Burn (formerly known as No Code) and published by Konami and [Annapurna Interactive](https://www.polygon.com/annapurna-interactive-direct-tgs-2025-showcase/).

_Silent Hill: Townfall_ is set to release on PS5 and PC sometime in 2026, though no specific release date has been announced. The game is currently available to wishlist on Steam. It seems that Konami is sticking to its promise to release a [new Silent Hill game every year](https://www.polygon.com/silent-hill-annual-franchise-konami-new-games/), and more info on Townfall will likely be available via the [Silent Hill Transmission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPE5XdS1OBw) starting immediately after State of Play ends.
