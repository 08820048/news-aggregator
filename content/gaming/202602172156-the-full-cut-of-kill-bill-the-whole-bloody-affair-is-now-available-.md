It’s no secret that Quentin Tarantino originally conceived of [Kill Bill: Vol. 1](https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/10/09/review-of-kill-bill-volume-1) and [Vol. 2](https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/04/15/review-of-kill-bill-volume-2) as a single movie, which has long contributed to his claim that he’s only directed nine movies total. While this full version of Kill Bill was deemed a little too much for the average theater-goer back in the early 2000’s, two decades of acclaim finally led to the full release of the original edit last year.

If you weren’t quite willing to hack out the almost five-hour-long marathon in theaters (Tarantino would be disappointed), you can now buy Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair [on digital to watch at home](https://zdcs.link/91wvWk?object_uuid=a71bf83a-401a-4df3-8f08-c8748de2e0e0&t=article).

## **Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair Lands on Digital**

### Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair

Clocking in at four hours and 41 minutes, Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair officially released in theaters for the first time this past November. Tarantino initially wanted the film to only be available in theaters, making a digital release slightly surprising. While a physical release of the full duology has [seemingly been confirmed](https://www.ign.com/articles/kill-bill-the-whole-bloody-affair-is-coming-to-digital-sooner-than-you-think), I wouldn’t anticipate a streaming release on any particular service.

The Whole Bloody Affair is not in fact just Kill Bill: Volume 1 and 2 smushed together, and instead features the ‘original’ editing with some scenes around. This includes an extended version of the O-Ren Ishii anime sequence as well as full color during the House of the Blue Leaves fight. All in all, our [9/10 review](https://www.ign.com/articles/kill-bill-the-whole-bloody-affair-review) claims the over-four-hour-long saga “retains all the exuberant action highlights that made the duology an instant classic while allowing the saga’s emotional pieces to fall more neatly into place.”

Tarantino also collaborated with Epic Games and visualization studio The Third Floor on Yuki’s Revenge, a short film that [premiered in Fortnite](https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-our-first-look-at-quentin-tarantinos-new-lost-chapter-of-kill-bill-starring-an-animated-uma-thurman-and-fortnites-peely-the-banana) just before The Whole Bloody Affair landed in theaters. Developed from what was originally a deleted scene, the short film follows Yuki Yubari hunting down The Bride to avenge her sister, Gogo. That's now [available to watch for free](https://www.ign.com/videos/fortnite-official-the-lost-chapter-yukis-revenge-animated-short).

More recently, Tarantino made headlines for talking smack about a spread of actors, most notably Paul Dano, who was readily defended by [most of the industry](https://www.ign.com/articles/i-was-incredibly-grateful-that-the-world-spoke-up-for-me-so-i-didnt-have-to-paul-dano-breaks-silence-after-quentin-tarantino-insult). Otherwise, there’s still no word on the auteur’s tenth and ['final'](https://www.ign.com/articles/quentin-tarantinos-final-movie-revealed-in-new-report) movie since the [The Movie Critic was scrapped](https://www.ign.com/articles/quentin-tarantino-was-reportedly-toying-with-a-goodbye-meta-verse-idea-for-scrapped-film-the-movie-critic). At the very least, the full release of Kill Bill means that number makes a little more sense.
