To celebrate, The Pokémon Company has recently dropped a 30th Anniversary Pokémon Day TCG Collection, featuring a specially stamped foil Pikachu promo card, a metallic coin featuring the 30th anniversary logo, and three booster packs from Phantasmal Flames and Mega Evolution.

### Pokémon TCG: Pokémon Day 2026 Collection

Proving a popular set, Pokémon TCG's 30th Anniversary TCG Collection is stocked at all major retailers. However, navigating the market requires a bit of strategy; prices are fluctuating from its original $49.99 launch price.

In the week following its release, [TCGplayer](https://zdcs.link/a07ekA?object_uuid=a60c8e55-21b1-4f63-af47-e53122b1cea8&t=article) reported a low sale price of $18.79. That’s a decent drop from the launch price, though it’s back up to around $26.98 market price at the time of writing. Still, that's a significant 58.87% drop in resale value in just a month, making this all the more affordable for fans to pick up right now.

If you’re looking for the lowest "in-stock" price right now, direct from a major retailer, [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Pok%C3%A9mon-TCG-Day-2026-Collection/dp/B0G2FVLXVL/ref=sr_1_1?crid=36VQRZIV3UEAJ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.fpJDom5qEWmKC0FcSlN6VIskxWDbsXrw_vz63nbDXOnPWWrJIH7xP97VRCaDCHQoaTT0Ax7GTdN5nAlTKd8v0h9qirbSbiiEWD7eKZwOhLB-lNHalc47TcMFdCpXSBpPCg-DQ0-aLHK6CIw_iviZoheXuUpnyGVWClbf0bjytHgyS6KktRc0tr9vVcWTSni_lAL_vwiFH5wcas89RIfpjBp9RReM80I2BPu6NENeqB5DzDIyrVlAZKqGB5VFaoUy2icu9opjnW-xVdPVcgpB8oJ8vCyIA96S2gcHIWaaKbg.dCTp1x9Nb8Laf8Ks31TMSiKjSHnlOi-hH0k2yZJu17s&dib_tag=se&keywords=pokemon+pokemon+day+collection&qid=1768584789&sprefix=pokemon+pokemon+day+collection%2Caps%2C210&sr=8-1&tag=tcg-ign-20&ascsubtag=06U9e7yJctIoHdAg4l1vnCG) leads the pack at $34.45 (a 31% discount from MSRP). That being said, we’ve seen them dip [as low as $26.99](https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-day-2026-tcg-collection-is-back-in-stock-with-a-major-new-discount-at-amazon) here before, so it’s up to you if you want to hold for that or opt for TCGplayer instead.

[Best Buy](https://zdcs.link/Q45Eq4?object_uuid=a60c8e55-21b1-4f63-af47-e53122b1cea8&t=article) is holding firm at $49.99, while [Target](https://zdcs.link/aR72pE?object_uuid=a60c8e55-21b1-4f63-af47-e53122b1cea8&t=article) has already been cleaned out of their $17.99 stock - a price so low you can’t be surprised!

If you’re hunting for a sub-$20 pull, it’s best to keep an eye on local inventory or set up an alert for online restocks from [reputable resellers](https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-pokemon-tcg). Just remember - these figures are based on US retailers, so international collectors should factor in global shipping costs.

If you’re looking to resell yourself, I’d recommend you keep looking. Given the lack of exclusive anniversary packs inside, it’s not likely the Pokémon TCG's 30th Anniversary TCG Collection will turn over a huge profit.

That being said, while the stamped foil promo card of Pikachu isn’t a unique illustration, its status as the first official 30th-anniversary product might be worth something to completionists in a few years. I’d recommend picking up two at or near MSRP if you’ve got the space - one to hold onto as an investment, one to rip.

There’s [one more Pokémon TCG set](https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-full-release-schedule-2026) to be released in the first quarter of the year - Perfect Order. You can put in your [preorders here](https://www.tcgplayer.com/search/all/me03-perfect-order?q=Pok%C3%A9mon+TCG+Perfect+Order&view=grid&page=1&ProductTypeName=Sealed+Products&setName=me03-perfect-order&irclickid=W1qwWG0DQxyZUhR2aFwLM2YOUkux38T1nx5A1U0&sharedid=&irpid=1442478&irgwc=1&afsrc=1&utm_source=impact&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=IGN%E2%80%8A) via TCGplayer for current market price.
