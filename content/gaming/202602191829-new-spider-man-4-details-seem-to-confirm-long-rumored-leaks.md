Here's everything we know so far

## Spider-Man: Brand New Day story synopsis just made those leaks harder to ignore

[_Spider-Man: Brand New Day_](https://www.polygon.com/spider-man-4-brand-new-day-teaser-marvel-movie-new-suit/) is set to hit theaters later this July, and the lead-up to the release has been inundated with speculation and rumors about who will appear, which confirmed actors are set to play which [Marvel](https://www.polygon.com/marvel/) characters, and what the fourth Tom Holland Spider-Man movie will be about. But Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios haven't said much, officially, about Peter Parker's next adventure. Thankfully, an official synopsis has been included in the movie's art book, available on [Penguin Random House's website](http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/834186/spider-man-brand-new-day---the-art-of-the-movie-by-jess-harrold/), and it makes sense of some longstanding rumors.

The art book is set to release on Aug. 4, a few weeks after the film premieres on July 31. The book's description reveals that four years have passed since the last film, 2021's [_Spider-Man: No Way Home_](https://www.polygon.com/22839425/spider-man-no-way-home-ending-spoilers-sequels/). So here we will share the new synopsis, followed by some rumors that don't sound too far-fetched now that we have something substantial to work on.

## Spider-Man: Brand New Day's story (no spoilers!)

    ![Spider-Man: Homecoming - Spider-Man inside a truck with cages](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8772031/spider_man_homecoming_cages_3840.jpg?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2)Chuck Zlotnick/Sony Pictures

"Four years have gone by since we last caught up with our friendly neighborhood hero," the description says. "Peter Parker is no more, but Spider-Man is at the top of his game keeping New York City safe. Things are going well for our anonymous hero until an unusual trail of crimes pulls him into a web of mystery larger than he's ever faced before. In order to take on what's ahead, Spider-Man not only needs to be at the top of his physical and mental game, but he must also be prepared to face the repercussions of his past!"

The description confirms several things, while hinting at a few others. Since four years have passed, it sounds like audiences will miss out on a majority of Peter Parker's college years, as the [final scene of _No Way Home_](https://www.polygon.com/22839425/spider-man-no-way-home-ending-spoilers-sequels/) teased Pete studying for his GED to sign up. It also confirms that Doctor Strange's spell to make people forget Peter is still in effect.

The synopsis is absent details on all the other characters who will appear in _Spider-Man: Brand New Day_, but thanks to recent leaks and reliable rumors, we have a good sense of who will be appearing.

## Who is Sadie Sink playing in Spider-Man: Brand New Day?

[Characters like Bruce Banner/Hulk](https://www.polygon.com/spider-man-4-cast-brand-new-day-hulk-punisher/) (Mark Ruffalo) and Frank Castle/Punisher (Jon Bernthal) are confirmed to appear, alongside several villains yet to be fully detailed. But the biggest mystery surrounds who Sadie Sink, best known for [_Stranger Things_](https://www.polygon.com/stranger-things/), is playing in _Spider-Man: Brand New Day_.

Sink has said she’s [not allowed](https://www.ign.com/articles/sadie-sink-says-its-torture-not-being-allowed-to-talk-about-which-character-shes-playing-in-spider-man-brand-new-day) to reveal any details about her role, only intensifying speculation. Early rumors suggested she could portray Felicia Hardy (aka Black Cat), Gwen Stacy, or the villain [Shathra](https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/edge-of-spider-verse-shathra-explainer-ultimate-predator). However, more recent buzz [points to Jean Grey](https://nerdist.com/article/sadie-sink-role-in-spider-man-4-could-connect-to-xmen-jean-grey-firestar/), a member of the X-Men previously portrayed by Famke Janssen and Sophie Turner. The mention of a “mental game” could fuel theories that Sink's role could involve telepathic or telekinetic abilities. She may even discover Peter is Spider-Man because of these powers, as a leaked trailer sees Sink [threatening](http://www.reddit.com/r/MCUTheories/comments/1pofkjs/these_were_sadie_sinks_characters_words_in_the/) to expose his identity.

Meanwhile, Zendaya is set to return as MJ in _Brand New Day_, and there’s speculation MJ may have a new love interest — something that could directly connect to whoever Sink ultimately turns out to be playing.

## How many villains are in Spider-Man: Brand New Day?

Alongside Sink, Liza Colón-Zayas and Tramell Tillman have been tapped for mystery roles. Marvin Jones III, who previously voiced Tombstone in [_Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse_](https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/28/18105326/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-review/), is set to portray the crime boss in live-action as the MCU unveils its own interpretation of the villain. Meanwhile, Michael Mando is returning as Mac Gargan, a role he hasn’t reprised since [_Spider-Man: Homecoming_](https://www.polygon.com/tom-holland-spider-man-homecoming-movie-tubi/). With newly released [merchandise artwork](http://thedirect.com/article/marvel-studios-scorpion-live-action-costume) making the rounds, many fans believe this could finally be the moment Gargan suits up as Scorpion.

But there have also been [rumors](https://comicbook.com/movies/news/new-spider-man-brand-new-day-rumor-would-smash-every-mcu-villain-record/) swirling that many more villains are expected to arrive, including Tarantula, Boomerang, and Ramrod. In a purportedly leaked _Brand New Day_ trailer, many saw an army of red-clad men attacking Spider-Man, which alludes to the Hand, a clandestine ninja group typically associated with Daredevil. The Hand has also been led by the Punisher in recent[comic book stories](https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/jason-aaron-punisher-interview-2022-series). The leaked trailer also shows Spider-Man eventually battling the Hulk, so the film could feature Spidey trading blows with up to eight different characters.
