Maybe Bowser Jr. isn't the new Mario movie's only villain?

## A Super Mario Galaxy Movie plot summary may have spoiled another character reveal

[_The Super Mario Galaxy Movie_](https://www.polygon.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-nintendo-direct/) will pit Mario and Luigi (and Yoshi) against a new galactic threat, a goop-powered Bowser Jr., when Illumination and [Nintendo](https://www.polygon.com/nintendo/)'s new animated movie hits theaters in April. But according to a surprising new description of the film, the son of Bowser may not be the only big bad the brothers will face in the sequel to _The Super Mario Bros. Movie_.

Based on U.K.-based theater chain [Everyman](https://www.everymancinema.com/film-listing/327878-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie/#coming-soon)'s description of _The Super Mario Galaxy Movie_, the brothers Mario (and Toad, Yoshi, Princess Peach, Rosalina, etc.) will also have to contend with Wario, who will serve as co-antagonist in the film. "After defeating Bowser and saving Brooklyn, Mario faces Wario and Bowser Jr.'s evil alliance," Everyman's description of the movie reads, as spotted by [Nintendo Wire](https://nintendowire.com/news/2026/02/20/a-surprise-super-mario-galaxy-movie-character-may-have-been-spoiled-by-london-based-cinema-chain-everyman-cinema/). "Now, alongside his friends and Yoshi, he must stop their plans for world domination."

If Wario is indeed in _The Super Mario Galaxy Movie_, that would be a major surprise. Nintendo and Illumination haven't confirmed an appearance from Wario, nor even hinted at him in previous trailers for the movie. Wario has not appeared in any marketing materials for the film, nor is he included in the [first batch of toys coming for _The Super Mario Galaxy Movie_](https://www.bigbadtoystore.com/Search?SearchText=mario+galaxy). Though those toys have all-but confirmed an appearance from [ROB](https://www.mariowiki.com/R.O.B.).

Everyman's description of the film also differs drastically from the mundane synopsis posted by other movie theater chains, including [AMC](https://www.amctheatres.com/movies/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-71465), [Regal](https://www.regmovies.com/movies/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-ho00020250), and [Alamo Drafthouse](https://drafthouse.com/show/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie), which reads:

> The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is an animated film based on the world of Super Mario Bros., and follows The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which was released in 2023 and earned more than $1.3 billion worldwide. Both the 2023 film and The Super Mario Galaxy Movie are produced by Chris Meledandri of Illumination and Shigeru Miyamoto of Nintendo. The film will be co-financed by Universal Pictures and Nintendo and will be released worldwide by Universal Pictures. The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is directed by returning filmmakers Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, from a screenplay by returning screenwriter Matthew Fogel, with Brian Tyler returning to compose the score.

That said, there's nothing in the rules that says that Wario _can't_ appear in _The Super Mario Galaxy Movie_. The film is clearly [drawing inspiration from multiple Super Mario games](https://www.polygon.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-easter-eggs/), and features characters like Mouser, Birdo, and Clawgrip from _Super Mario Bros. 2_, Big Bertha and Frog Luigi from _Super Mario Bros. 3_, and Tostarenans from _Super Mario Odyssey_. Why couldn't Nintendo and Illumination also draw from _Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins_, with the inclusion of Wario? (I'll tell you why: If Wario's in here but Daisy isn't, a large contingent of people are going to be extremely mad online.)

Frankly, I'm skeptical that we're already entering the Wario phase of the Mario Cinematic Universe, just two movies in. What's more, there hasn't been a flavor of [Old Spice deodorant leaked](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksAndRumors/comments/1m2k08v/super_mario_2_old_spice_leak/) yet that indicates a Wario appearance, though a garlic-scented stick would certainly be a good marketing gag. Maybe Nintendo and Illumination are keeping Wario's role in _The Super Mario Galaxy Movie_ close to the vest for now, waiting until tickets go on sale before revealing the film's biggest draw.

But perhaps Jack Black, the voice of Bowser, [got his wish](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jack-black-wants-pedro-pascal-to-play-wario-in-the-next-mario-movie/1100-6513087/), and we'll get a Pedro Pascal-voiced Wario in a Mario movie.

_The Super Mario Galaxy Movie_ opens in movie theaters on April 1. Wario currently appears in [_Super Mario Tennis Fever_](https://www.polygon.com/mario-tennis-fever-tennis-games-2026/), in both adult and baby forms.
