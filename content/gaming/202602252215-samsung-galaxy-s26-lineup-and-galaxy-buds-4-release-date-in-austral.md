## About the new Samsung Galaxy Lineup

First things first, let’s dive into the specs of the new [Galaxy S26](https://zdcs.link/QG8GMV?object_uuid=1656e0d6-58de-41bf-8fc0-4b030c8aec06&t=article). You’ll still have the common improvements you’ve come from Samsung—improved camera quality with a 200MP wide lens and 50MP telephoto lens, lightning quick charging ability, and of course, the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy chip.

Yet, what really makes this device stand out is the world-first ‘Privacy Screen’ display on the [Ultra](https://zdcs.link/znBXdb?object_uuid=1656e0d6-58de-41bf-8fc0-4b030c8aec06&t=article). When enabled, this update narrows the arrangement of pixels to obscure your screen better. You can even hide your notifications or apps from view at the push of a button.

Samsung Australia also revealed a couple more surprises during Unpacked. They’ve reaffirmed a commitment to expanding Galaxy AI through a multi-modal mixture—with Google’s Gemini LLM, Bixby, and the introduction of Perplexity (an additional AI agent) into the mix. There’s the newly redesigned Samsung [Galaxy Buds 4](https://zdcs.link/QK8OVY?object_uuid=1656e0d6-58de-41bf-8fc0-4b030c8aec06&t=article) on their way. Refreshed to better match the S26 design, these 96kHz buds will now have both the EQ and Adaptive Noise Cancellation settings better integrated with Galaxy OS.

So, before the release of the and Galaxy Buds 4 on March 11, you can jump in first and [pre-order your devices through Samsung Australia](https://zdcs.link/QK8OVY?object_uuid=1656e0d6-58de-41bf-8fc0-4b030c8aec06&t=article) now.
