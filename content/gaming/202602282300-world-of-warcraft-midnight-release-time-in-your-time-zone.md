The release of [**_World of Warcraft: Midnight_**](https://www.polygon.com/world-of-warcraft/) marks not only a new chapter in the Worldsoul narrative arc — which began with _The War Within_ — but also a new phase for this classic MMORPG. With the changes Blizzard is implementing, like [removing add-ons](https://www.polygon.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-prepatch-12-0-mods-addons/) and other new systems, _WoW_ is transforming almost on a fundamental level.

If you're eager to experience the beginning of _Midnight_ and see for yourself how this new moment in the game's history unfolds, be ready to set an alarm for **when** **_World of Warcraft: Midnight_** **releases in your time zone**.

## What to expect from World of Warcraft: Midnight

With _Midnight_, Blizzard is taking its mission of making _WoW_ a game for everyone seriously. In addition to more dungeons, a new campaign storyline quests, and a new Demon hunter specialization, _WoW is_ introducing content for those who want something different from the usual MMO experience Blizzard has been offering so far, especially when it comes to solo players.

Among the biggest additions in the new expansion is the **housing system**. It allows players to own and customize their houses with all kinds of furniture, from cute little chairs to more exotic items, like the otherworldly Dark Portal. While quite a complete system, it's tied to other activities in the game — which, as Polygon's Oli Welsh wrote in [his impression of the system](https://www.polygon.com/world-of-warcraft-housing-early-access/), "It's a somewhat risky strategy. Players who just want to make a lovely home may get frustrated that they can't expand it without engaging in achievement-hunting, crafting, questing, or browsing the auction house. But it also displays a clear ambition to expand what _Wow_ is, and the kind of players it can attract, even this far into its lifespan."

Along with the housing system, a new feature that is coming to _WoW_ is the **Prey system**. Almost like the hunts in the Monster Hunter games, the prey system in _Midnight_ lets you seek specific targets by searching for clues. To make your target appear, you need to complete open world activities like world quests or killing rare enemies. Even though chasing a target feels less complex than a raid boss fight, the prey system includes all kinds of features, from affixes to difficulty modes, to make every hunt a fresh challenge.
