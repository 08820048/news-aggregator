## How to unlock and make katsu curry

Upon your first visit to the Last Night spaceship, you will unlock the **kitchen** on the right side of the ship. Speak with your mom, and she'll offer to make you some katsu curry. There are 10 katsu curries in total, but their names and detailed effects remain hidden until you've cooked them for the first time.

Despite giving off the impression that your in-game mom is making the katsu curry for you, you must **complete the katsu curry minigame** to obtain a dish. The minigame is fairly simple: Hold the right mouse button (PC), RT (Xbox), or R2 (PS) until the three-second timer ends, then press the left mouse button (PC), the B button (Xbox), or the Circle button (PS) when the temperature meter hits 100 in the lower right corner.

The closer you are to 100, the higher the **katsu curry's tier**. The lowest possible tier is D-tier, and the highest is S-tier. Of course, S-tier curries offer better bonuses than low-tier curries. To consume a katsu curry during combat, equip the curry in your item slots. You can only cook a new curry of the same type after you've eaten or discarded the previous one.

## How to get katsu curry ingredients in Romeo Is a Dead Man

There are several ways to obtain cooking ingredients in _Romeo Is a Dead Man_:

-   **Collect ingredients in space**. Apparently, the universe is littered with potatoes, cilantro, and instant coffee. While flying your spaceship, hover over the glowing orbs with your reticle to collect space debris or random cooking ingredients.
-   **Collect tesseracts**. Interact with the glowing green cubes found throughout the world to collect random items, including cooking ingredients.
-   **Buy them from Shiroyabu**. On the Last Night, interact with the computer in the library (between the upgrade room and your bedroom). Shirobayu offers cooking ingredients for 5-60 Emerald Flowsion a piece. Don't be too eager to spend your Flowsion, though, as you also need this for stat upgrades!
