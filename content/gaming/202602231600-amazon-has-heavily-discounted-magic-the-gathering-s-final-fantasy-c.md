[Magic: The Gathering](https://www.ign.com/games/magic-the-gathering-trading-card-game) launched its Final Fantasy set last Summer, and while it feels a lifetime ago with such a fast-moving set release cadence, its Commander Decks live long in the memory.

All four were solid, and Amazon has most of them discounted right now. Not only does that include the popular Limit Break and Counter Blitz decks, but [the new version of Limit Break](https://zdcs.link/zJ82Mq?object_uuid=8fce6d71-871a-4b64-a38d-843f27eb4c61&t=article) with a Promo Card and download code is discounted, too.

## Get Final Fantasy Commander Decks at a Discount Right Now

Starting with Limit Break, the new ‘Game Edition’ includes the 100-card Commander deck helmed by Cloud, Ex-SOLDIER, and an exclusive Promo Card, too. It also has a Steam code for the original Final Fantasy 7 (not to be confused with the remake). It’s now $72.99, down from $99.99 (which was admittedly steep anyway).

If you already have that, or just want to save some Gil, [you can pick up the standard edition for $64.45](https://zdcs.link/9yPX0n?object_uuid=8fce6d71-871a-4b64-a38d-843f27eb4c61&t=article), discounted by around five bucks. The deck is equipment-focused, aiming to get your creatures powered up to trigger effects like token generation.

Whisper it, though: We still think Counter Blitz, the Final Fantasy X deck, is the best of the bunch. Its combination of Tidus and Yuna can use Summons for big power on the board, and manipulate the counters to keep them around indefinitely.

[The deck is down to $48.99](https://zdcs.link/z3ORJR?object_uuid=8fce6d71-871a-4b64-a38d-843f27eb4c61&t=article), a 30% discount from its list price of $69.99.

Finally, the [Final Fantasy 6-themed Revival Trance](https://zdcs.link/zj84Jp?object_uuid=8fce6d71-871a-4b64-a38d-843f27eb4c61&t=article) isn’t the most cohesive deck out of the box, but with the right upgrades, it could be really useful. It’s traditionally been discounted right from launch, and it’s got a 30% discount, too.

That brings it down to $48.75, meaning the only deck from the set not included in the current deals is Final Fantasy XIV’s Scions and Spellcraft - that one is out of stock at the time of writing.
