Surprise! Japanese studio CyberConnect2 is marking its 30th anniversary with the announcement of a new [.hack](https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/hack) game: .hack//Z.E.R.O.

To whet our collective appetites, we've even been treated to a teaser trailer, which you can watch below.

.hack is a series of action RPG games that explore a virtual game-space called The World, with action taking place both there and in our real world, branching off of a multimedia franchise that extends to a collectible card game, a Japanese-only MMORPG, plus animated movies, manga, and live-action TV shows.

> Today, February 16, 2026 marks the 30th anniversary of CyberConnect2.
> 
> To commemorate, we will begin development of .hack//Z.E.R.O., a new original game. This title will be fully self-published by CyberConnect2, from planning to development to release.[#hackZERO](https://twitter.com/hashtag/hackZERO?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#dothack](https://twitter.com/hashtag/dothack?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/J5nrgnXU83](https://t.co/J5nrgnXU83)

It's been the best part of ten years since we last had a .hack game — the last was [.hack//G.U. Last Recode](https://www.ign.com/games/hackgu-last-recode) in 2017 — but don't let that put you off: Hiroshi "Piros" Matsuyama recently told [Famitsu](https://www.famitsu.com/article/202602/66142) that the new release won't link directly to any previous title, so you don't need to come into the game with any prior knowledge.

Although .hack has always been developed by CyberConnect2 and has usually been published by Bandai Namco, Bandai Namco has given CyberConnect2 permission to "manage the entirety of the project from planning and development to release."

As for what to expect? "World-renowned violinist Taro Hakase has penned the music, kick-starting the project to the dexterous tune of his violin. .hack//Z.E.R.O. will be a novel RPG experience that blends the series’ trademark duality of fantasy (game world) and reality (real world) with modern expectations, infused with 100% pure CyberConnect2 spirit.

"The game will be enjoyable for both veteran fans and new players alike," the team said. "Please look forward to this newest iteration of .hack."
