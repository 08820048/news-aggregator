DC K.O. is the latest epic crossover dominating the DC Universe. This storyline brings together dozens of heroes and villains to [take part in a martial arts death tournament](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-fate-of-the-dc-universe-rests-on-a-death-tournament-in-dc-ko). The ultimate winner will be crowned King Omega and granted the power to battle the almighty Darkseid. And with the release of DC K.O. #4, we now know the identity of King Omega.

But that's arguably not the biggest development in DC K.O. #4. This issue is also notable for featuring the first real crossover between the regular DC Universe and the Absolute Universe. What happens when Batman fights Absolute Batman? And who is King Omega in the end? Read on to learn more, but beware of **full spoilers for DC K.O. #4 ahead!**

Issue #4 opens with only four combatants left standing - Superman, Lex Luthor, Wonder Woman, and Joker. Their opponents this time are the Absolute Universe versions of Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman, along with a Darkseid-possessed Booster Gold. Darkseid has brainwashed the Absolute heroes to be his personal fighting force, and they waste no time in bringing the pain.

Joker is so taken aback by Absolute Batman that he immediately defects and offers to become Darkseid's fourth horseman. However, that betrayal is quickly canceled out when the regular Batman returns to the battlefield following [his surprise defeat in DC K.O. #1](https://www.ign.com/articles/dc-ko-1-reveals-why-the-justice-league-is-fighting-a-death-tournament-and-you-wont-believe-who-loses-in-the-first-round). Thanks to the events of the tie-in series DC K.O.: Knightfight, Batman is granted a second chance to fight. The Dark Knight impales Joker just as the Clown Prince of Crime did to him. That leaves the two versions of the DC Trinity to battle it out, while Luthor bides his time.

The battle doesn't go well for Prime Earth's champions. Between their relative youth, their more unpredictable powers, and their Darkseid-fueled rage, the Absolute heroes quickly dominate the fight. Absolute Batman even manages to gore Superman like a bull by donning a pair of Kryptonite ear tips.

But Superman finally turns the tide when he summons all his might and punches Darkseid right out of Booster Gold. The villain's influence over the Absolute heroes is immediately severed. Darkseid finally emerges in his true, godly form, and the united heroes of the two DC Universes prepare to finish the fight.

Sadly, this new alliance proves painfully short-lived. Darkseid is a mighty opponent on the best of days, and in his new, powered-up form, he makes quick work of the two Trinities. One blast of his Omega Sanction is enough to vaporize Absolute Superman and both versions of Batman and Wonder Woman. Only Superman and Luthor are left standing.

Superman entreats his nemesis to join forces and finally bring an end to Darkseid's reign. But Luthor remembers something Superman has forgotten - only King Omega is strong enough to take on Darkseid, and there can be only one King Omega. He unleashes the final burst of energy from his power armor and kills Superman.

And with that, the DC K.O. tournament has a winner. It's fitting that Luthor would emerge as the king of the hill, given that he previously told Superman that the real source of his hatred for him is that Superman doesn't do enough with his power to help humanity. Now that Luthor has attained ultimate power, he has the chance to prove he can do better. Assuming he can survive his final battle with Darkseid in DC K.O. #5, that is.

Issue #4 ends with an epilogue showing the future of a Darkseid-dominated DC Universe. Darkseid's minion Saturn Girl helps her master kidnap and enslave the Absolute heroes. As a reward, she's given the chance to peer into Darkseid's mind. She's sees a void of nothingness spanning all of eternity, but she's also surprised to glimpse one small pocket of creation amid that endless void. Inside that pocket is none other than the Time Trapper, the evolved, intelligent version of Doomsday who helped orchestrate the tournament before being betrayed by Booster Gold. It seems that character still has a part to play in this conflict. Could the final battle actually be Lex Luthor and Doomsday vs. Darkseid? We'll find out in March when DC K.O. #5 hits the stands.
