[Magic: The Gathering](https://www.ign.com/games/magic-the-gathering-trading-card-game) has become “crossover central” in recent years, and while some fans have conflicting thoughts on [the game’s 2026 roadmap](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-full-release-schedule-updated-2026), it does lead to some absolutely bizarre combinations.

A few months ago, [we pointed out a ridiculous combo](https://www.ign.com/articles/this-warhammer-40k-tyranid-mtg-card-spiked-350-in-value-thanks-to-sonic-the-hedgehog) between Sonic the Hedgehog and Warhammer 40K’s Winged Hive Tyrant, but we might just have something that matches it in the [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles set](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-where-to-buy-updated-2026), launching next month.

## Krang And The Necrons Is A Hell Of A Band Name

Artifact Creatures in Magic: The Gathering are essentially just that - a blend of two card types. That means cards that affect Artifacts, and those that buff Creatures, will help power them up nicely.

We mention this because Krang, Utrom Warlord, could be quite ridiculous when paired with a deck focused on Artifact Creatures, like Necron Dynasties from the Warhammer 40K Universes Beyond Commander deck lineup.

Krang, Utrom Warlord is a nine-cost (expensive, yes), but has the keywords Flying, Trample, Indestructible, and Haste. Oh, and it’s a 9/9.

That’s a pain to deal with on its own, but the card also gives other Artifact Creatures you control Flying, Trample, Indestructible and Haste.

For context, almost every single creature in the Necron Dynasties deck is an Artifact Creature, so dropping Kang onto the battlefield alongside them could be a potential game-ender.

It feels like it’ll find a spot in a lot of decks based around that creature type, given it’s colorless, too, and we wouldn’t be surprised to see it climb in value somewhat.

As for Necron Dynasties, you’ll need to find it on the secondary market these days, but the mono-black deck was already plenty powerful already.

We’ll find out soon, though - the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles set launches on March 6, with preorders available already.
