For over 30 years, the toys of the [Toy Story franchise](https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/29/19102537/toy-story-4-woody-pixar-movies-themes/) have repeatedly found themselves nearly abandoned, lost, or destroyed. The first full trailer for [Pixar](https://www.polygon.com/608018/pixar-movies-new-vs-old/)'s [_Toy Story 5_](https://www.polygon.com/toy-story-5-trailer-woody-buzz/) has arrived to remind us of that, once more, the toys face the potential end of their world. This time, the form of their destroyer is a tablet computer that Bonnie, who got the toys from Andy in _Toy Story 3_, becomes obsessed with.

"Extinction, not again!" Rex (Wallace Shawn) cries out upon seeing the tablet, named Lilypad (Greta Lee).

This is what brings Woody (Tom Hanks) home from his journeys on the road. If you remember the end of [_Toy Story 4_](https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/13/18677569/toy-story-4-review-forky/), you'll recall that Woody set off with Bo Peep (Annie Potts) at the end of that film to help other lost toys find a home. Now, Woody's coming home to save his friends again. Bo Peep can be seen in the background of a shot in the trailer, though she doesn't have any lines. However, Duke Caboom (Keanu Reeves) can also be seen, and we refuse to believe Pixar would have either of these toys back without having them play a bigger role.

A synopsis for the film reads, "The toys are back, and this time, Buzz Lightyear, Woody, Jessie, and the rest of the gang's jobs are challenged when they come face-to-face with Lilypad, a brand-new tablet device that arrives with her own disruptive ideas about what is best for their kid, Bonnie. Will playtime ever be the same?"

Based on what little we see of Lilypad's personality in the trailer, it's clear she and the toys are going to clash with each other. This is a Toy Story movie, though, so if they aren't all friends by the end of the film, something's gone horribly wrong at Pixar. Along the way, we'll get an army of Buzz Lightyears, Forky's wedding, and plenty of Woody and Buzz lovingly bickering.

In other words, it'll be a Toy Story movie.

_Toy Story 5_ lands in theaters on June 19.
