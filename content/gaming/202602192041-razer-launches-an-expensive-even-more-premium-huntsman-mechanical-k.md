Razer [has announced](https://www.razer.com/newsroom/product-news/huntsman-signature-edition/) a new high-end addition to its Huntsman line of [mechanical keyboards](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-keyboard). Called the [Huntsman Signature Edition](https://www.razer.com/gaming-keyboards/razer-huntsman-signature-edition/RZ03-05510100-R3M1), this tenkeyless keyboard will be made of more premium materials, cost $499.99, and "is debuting in a limited drop of 1,337 serialized units," the company says in its announcement. Why that number? You know why. (But if you don't, [here's a primer on l337 speak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet).)

It's in the construction and materials where the spendy new Signature Edition sets itself apart from the older Huntsman V3 models it resembles (and that don't _quite_ measure up to the Razer BlackWidow V4 that IGN [prefers for gaming](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-keyboard)). Where previous Huntsman keyboards are encased in plastic, the Huntsman Signature Edition will be housed in a CNC-milled, anodized aluminum chassis, with a shiny, mirror-like finish on the underside and other parts of the keyboard, such as the company's special triple-headed snake keycap.

The company also promises that the keyboard's interior is "carefully layered ... with tuned foams and sound-dampening materials" to create "a full, rounded typing sound while improving overall key feel."

Otherwise, this fancy USB-C-wired keyboard will feature the same analog optical switches and Rapid Trigger Mode found in the [Huntsman V3 Pro](https://www.razer.com/gaming-keyboards/razer-huntsman-v3-pro/RZ03-04970200-R3U1), as well as the 8,000Hz polling rate the company has given the [latest version of that keyboard](https://www.razer.com/gaming-keyboards/razer-huntsman-v3-pro-8khz/RZ03-05530200-R3U1).

So, if you liked the responsiveness of the V3 models, there's probably a lot to like for you here, as well. Look for other typical Razer Huntsman keyboard features, including RGB lights under the keys, adjustable key actuation (between 0.1mm and 4mm), and on-the-fly macro recording. The Huntsman Special Edition will be available on Razer's website starting at 8AM PT on February 22 for $499.
