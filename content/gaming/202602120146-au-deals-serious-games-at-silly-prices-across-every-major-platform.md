There is a specific sting that comes from paying full price for a game, loving it, and then watching it tumble to pocket change six months later. I know that sting intimately. The upside is I can now tell you, with zero buyer’s remorse left to protect, which of these are actually worth your weekend.

## **This Day in Gaming 🎂**

In retro news, I’m getting an [Armacham Black Ops Pyro](https://fear.fandom.com/wiki/Armacham_Black_Ops_Pyros) to light 16 candles on a cake baked for **F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin**. I loved this nerve-shredding (at the time) sequel that continued the supernatural suspense story of Alma “just call me the chick from **The Ring**” Wade.

The tense atmosphere and jump scares from the original were ramped up with more intimidating enemy types and actual, physical interactions with ol’ Beelzebedhead herself. All talk aside, my most enduring memory of this whole thing was spamming an automatic nail gun to hang dudes like picture frames [with 14mm depleted uranium spikes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzPY7w6PIvI). How did that ammo go out of style?

You're supposed to tell me to "stay frosty." What kind of FPS is this?

Aussie birthdays for notable games.

-   [Monster Hunter Rise + Sunbreak](https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/bundles/70070000013809) (-84%) - **A$12.70** Still the cleanest feeling Monster Hunter to actually play, not just admire. The early hours can overwhelm, but once it clicks you are scheduling hunts like meetings.
-   [Sonic Origins Plus](https://www.amazon.com.au/Sonic-Origins-Plus/dp/B0BZJF8P1P?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-44%) - **A$35.40** Classic Sonic is still about momentum and muscle memory. A few levels remain mildly rude, yet as a nostalgia capsule it mostly earns its speed.
-   [Scribblenauts Mega Pack](https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000010815) (-90%) - **A$4.40** A puzzle game that asks “what if anything worked” and then sometimes regrets it. Messy, clever, and absurd value at this price.
-   [Little Nightmares II](https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000021686) (-67%) - **A$13.10** Quiet horror that trusts atmosphere over noise. A few trial and error deaths sting, but the imagery lingers long after the credits.
-   [Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Col.](https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000003621) (-67%) - **A$13.10** A playable museum where not every exhibit has aged well. Still, throwing pixelated fireballs for thirteen bucks feels historically responsible.

Or gift a [**Nintendo eShop Card**](https://zdcs.link/V0MbJ?object_uuid=e0c787f4-59ab-458d-8ce0-e0c4b1a0a44d&t=article).

## Exciting Bargains for Xbox

[

](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/17/ss-a97dd819c8778ba0bf306dc794067325fe930f8d-1920x1080-1758111837814.jpg)

-   [Borderlands 4](https://www.amazon.com.au/Borderlands-4/dp/B0FDDXJLTH?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-42%) - **A$69** Loud, colourful, and allergic to subtlety. The humour still swings wildly, but the gunplay with mates remains irresponsibly moreish.
-   [Far Cry 6](https://www.amazon.com.au/Far-Cry-6/dp/B09GW26S7B?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-43%) - **A$56.70** Yes, it is the Far Cry template again. It is also still good at letting you cause structured chaos for 40 hours straight.
-   [Dead Space](https://www.amazon.com.au/Dead-Space/dp/B0BGPL1H63?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-58%) - **A$46.20** Clinical, oppressive, and refreshingly confident. It does not shout. It waits. Then it removes a limb.
-   [Diablo IV](https://www.amazon.com.au/Diablo-IV/dp/B0BPW7VF2C?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-73%) - **A$30** The loot loop still hooks like it means it. Endgame arguments aside, thirty dollars for this much demon deleting is tidy business.
-   [Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/p/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/C4LLMHFQ1BXQ/0001) (-85%) - **A$8.20** Ridiculous, political, and surprisingly tender. The tone swerves hard, yet the shooting remains outrageously sharp.

**Xbox One**

-   [Dying Light 2: Stay Human](https://www.amazon.com.au/Dying-Light-2-Stay-Human/dp/B07DJXSCR1?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-70%) - **A$29.60** Parkour first, zombies second, story somewhere after that. When the movement flows, you forgive almost everything else.
-   [Darksiders III](https://www.amazon.com.au/Darksiders-III/dp/B071JM1XZB?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-56%) - **A$24.10** Leaner and meaner than expected. Difficulty spikes can bruise, but boss fights feel properly earned.
-   [Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2](https://www.amazon.com.au/Tony-Hawks-Pro-Skater-1-plus-2/dp/B08899NXR5?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-56%) - **A$30.70** Still the gold standard for remakes. Tight controls, immaculate vibes, and absolutely no time for nonsense.

Or just invest in an [**Xbox Card**](https://zdcs.link/glwRb?object_uuid=e0c787f4-59ab-458d-8ce0-e0c4b1a0a44d&t=article).

## **Pure Scores for PlayStation**

[

](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/27/streetfighter6maiguidetrailer-ign-blogroll-1738019269959.jpg)

-   [Street Fighter 6](https://www.amazon.com.au/Street-Fighter-6/dp/B0C5JQ1ZK7?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-45%) - **A$54.90** Deep without being smug about it. Online will humble you quickly, but the systems are generous enough to keep you learning.
-   [Mafia: The Old Country](https://www.amazon.com.au/Mafia-The-Old-Country/dp/B0F824JSJW?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-34%) - **A$59** Slow burn crime drama that values mood over mayhem. Not flashy, but it knows exactly what tone it is chasing.
-   [Suikoden I&II HD Rem.](https://www.amazon.com.au/Suikoden-I-II-HD-Remaster-Gate-Rune-and-Dunan-Unification-Wars/dp/B0DFHNV4LF?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-43%) - **A$39.70** Political intrigue and 100 plus recruitable characters. Some old school friction remains, but the writing still carries weight.
-   [Far Cry 6](https://www.amazon.com.au/Far-Cry-6/dp/B08FCSNWZ7?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-81%) - **A$19** At nineteen dollars the repetition barely matters. You are here for explosions and a charismatic villain, not subtle reinvention.
-   [Grand Theft Auto V](https://www.amazon.com.au/Grand-Theft-Auto-V/dp/B09WD1FJ42?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-52%) - **A$29** You know what this is. It is still absurdly detailed, still massive, and still somehow relevant.

**PS4**

-   [Octopath Traveler II](https://www.amazon.com.au/OCTOPATH-TRAVELER-II/dp/B0BFBMGLSW?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-47%) - **A$44.80** Stunning HD 2D visuals and far stronger character arcs this time. Structure stays familiar, but the storytelling finally sings.
-   [Kingdom Hearts All-In-One Package](https://store.playstation.com/en-au/product/EP0082-CUSA12025_00-KINGDOMHEARTSALL) (-49%) - **A$63.90** A glorious tangle of Disney, anime hair, and existential angst. Confusing, ambitious, and absurd value for the sheer volume alone.
-   [Crisis Core FF7 Reunion](https://www.amazon.com.au/CRISIS-CORE-FINAL-FANTASY-VII-REUNION/dp/B0BKLNKKGT?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-56%) - **A$37.20** Surprisingly punchy combat wrapped around a heartfelt prequel. Side missions pad it out, yet the core story still lands.

Or purchase a [**PS Store Card.**](https://zdcs.link/kn6Ww?object_uuid=e0c787f4-59ab-458d-8ce0-e0c4b1a0a44d&t=article)

## Purchase Cheap for PC

[

](https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/06/12/ghostsoftsushima-gameplaytrailer-08-1528767846170.jpg)

-   [Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut](https://zdcs.link/9l8nLN?object_uuid=e0c787f4-59ab-458d-8ce0-e0c4b1a0a44d&t=article) (-48%) - **A$49.30** Patient duels, postcard vistas, and combat that rewards timing over panic. Side content blends together, but the core loop is quietly addictive.
-   [No Man's Sky](https://zdcs.link/aD8ZKo?object_uuid=e0c787f4-59ab-458d-8ce0-e0c4b1a0a44d&t=article) (-60%) - **A$35.10** From cautionary tale to quiet triumph. It will not hold your hand, but if you meet it halfway the scale is still staggering.
-   [Hogwarts Legacy](https://zdcs.link/Qd8PY1?object_uuid=e0c787f4-59ab-458d-8ce0-e0c4b1a0a44d&t=article) (-86%) - **A$12.50** A lavish wizarding playground that absolutely nails atmosphere. The checklist design shows through, yet twelve dollars feels almost cheeky.
-   [Super Meat Boy](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1426210/It_Takes_Two) (-90%) - **A$2.10** Brutal, precise, and allergic to excuses. You will blame the game. It will almost never be the game.
-   [Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy](https://zdcs.link/aB8ZbE?object_uuid=e0c787f4-59ab-458d-8ce0-e0c4b1a0a44d&t=article) (-85%) - **A$13.40** A linear surprise with sharper writing than expected. Combat is fine, but the banter and character work do the real lifting.

Or just get a [**Steam Wallet Card**](https://zdcs.link/vdlm8?object_uuid=e0c787f4-59ab-458d-8ce0-e0c4b1a0a44d&t=article)
