[Marvel Rivals](https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-rivals) players are asking NetEase Games to take action after the emergence of an unofficial bounty website triggered fears that it could harm the community it’s supposedly trying to protect.

Fans of the hero shooter sounded the alarm when third-party site [Intlist.org](https://www.intlist.org/) went live on February 22. Established by Marvel Rivals content creator and X/Twitter user EchoRivals, its official Discord page says the goal is to give players an avenue to name those who intentionally sabotage or “throw” multiplayer matches and “put a price on their head.”

“Put a bounty on griefers & throwers,” the first post on its X account [says](https://x.com/IntlistOrg/status/2025754613811458425?s=20), promising a system that offers an 80% payout for those who successfully throw matches in retaliation. “Someone queues in, throws it back, gets paid.”

Intlist allows any player to post bounties related to disruptive behavior across seven games: Deadlock, Overwatch, Valorant, Counter-Strike 2, League of Legends, Dota 2, and, of course, Marvel Rivals. The site has done its best to sell the pitch as a simple solution to a common issue, but as Marvel Rivals fans have pointed out, there a number of concerns going unaddressed.

Some have already called out how a widely used bounty website could cause a domino effect that sees not only griefers punished but everyone else, too. One [Reddit user](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1rdm7f8/are_we_for_real_there_is_bounties_for_throwing/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) calling attention to the issue says they’ve already seen an increase in sabotaged matches for every kind of player, warning that “now every game is people throwing each other’s games.”

“Something tells me throwing the game of someone who throws already is not going to annoy anyone but the four unfortunate randoms on the team,” another popular reply from a fan [says](https://x.com/veswacitwo/status/2025783449370394970?s=20). “I do not see the point of this like at all.”

The Intlist account [replied](https://x.com/IntlistOrg/status/2025784791572873573?s=20) to the criticism above: “Collateral damage is an unfortunate reality of war.”

Another matter brought to the table by fans online revolves around how the community defines who is and isn’t sabotaging matches, as well as Intlist’s verification process. The primary purpose of the site was already facing scrutiny at launch, as players suspected there may be too few safeguards to keep well-meaning players from falling victim to retaliation through the bounty system. Reports that notable Marvel Rivals content creators [like Jay3](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1rdm7f8/comment/o76iaby/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) had joined the list of offenders only added to these concerns.

Meanwhile, as of the publication of this story, Intlist has been [pulled offline](https://x.com/IntlistOrg/status/2026711383954333922?s=20) as the team backing it teases that “something big is coming.” Discord messages from EchoRivals paint a clearer picture, explaining that the site was locked down after they “detected unauthorized access to our database from a single bad actor.”

“A limited number of email addresses tied to bounty posts were exposed,” the post adds. “No passwords, payment info, or plaintext IP addresses were compromised - we don't store any of those. The site is temporarily offline while we lock everything down - we were not taken down, one person just decided to ruin it for everyone temporarily. We're also working on some upgrades while we're at it.”

EchoRivals insists their intention is only to address problems that have plagued the competitive gaming community for years — Marvel Rivals included. Like so many other online games, the comic book character-filled spinoff has seen a consistent flow of reports of griefing activity since its launch in late 2024. The real-world story known as [the Kingsman drama](https://www.ign.com/articles/kingsman265-drama-explained-heres-why-everyone-cant-stop-talking-about-a-40000-marvel-rivals-tournament) also seemingly led to an influx of reports of thrown matches recently, as less serious players have attempted to spoil fair play in the name of a quick joke.

“I see a lot of throwers in general now who die a couple times and then say they’re just playing for the vibes while AFKing or throwing,” one Reddit user [said earlier this week](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1rdm7f8/comment/o7779dm/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), referencing events related to the Kingsman drama.

“I stopped playing the entirety of Season 6 because it just became so unbearable. Can’t believe people are still doing this stupid s\*\*t a month later.”

> Hey [@MarvelRivals](https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw), there's a website where people are offering money to throw people!  
> Please address it, thank you :) [https://t.co/cpIamSi9vl](https://t.co/cpIamSi9vl)

Intlist targets players across a variety of experiences, but the site has expressed specific interest in Marvel Rivals. [One of its posts](https://x.com/IntlistOrg/status/2025963500653203478?s=20) goes as far as to promise to “gladly shut down” if NetEase bans nefarious players and fixes its Engagement Optimized Matchmaking (EOMM) — a tactic [the studio has denied using in the past](https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1955117077561593877?s=20).

Many are calling for the website to be removed as they fear how it could affect all players, while others argue that something must be done to combat griefers. However, it seems almost everyone in between is asking the developers to step in.

“People resorting to soft doxing is kinda wild,” one fan [argued](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1rdm7f8/comment/o76hsk3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). “I dont understand why \[NetEase\] refuses do to anything when they can clearly code a bare minimum system to pick up lord farmers. Profits. Its for profits thats why.”

“Because what we need in games is more throwers and not a system that rewards positivity instead,” another X user [said](https://x.com/Betrigansmh/status/2025893783552884779?s=20) sarcastically.

Marvel Rivals is currently in the midst of Season 6, which added [Deadpool](https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-6-trailer-confirms-deadpool-as-next-playable-character-the-game-awards-2025) and [Elsa Bloodstone](https://www.ign.com/videos/marvel-rivals-official-elsa-bloodstone-the-hunter-heiress-character-reveal-trailer) as playable characters. NetEase has yet to address any long-term plans to deal with players looking to ruin the fun for others.
