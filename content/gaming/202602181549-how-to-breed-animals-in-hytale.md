**Breeding animals** in [_Hytale_](https://www.polygon.com/hytale/) can be a confusing process as, well, **animal breeding has not been implemented yet**. That said, you _can_ tame animals in _Hytale_ and start a lovely little farm full of rabbits, sheep, pigs, and cows; all you need to do is capture them and find their favorite food.

Here's how to build an animal farm, capture critters, and tame animals in _Hytale_.

**Update (Feb. 18)**: With Update 3, taming mechanics have been added to _Hytale_.

## How to capture animals in Hytale

As mentioned earlier, **you can't breed animals** in _Hytale_'s current early access state, but you _can_ capture them. Before you set out, be sure to build a large enclosure for the captured animals (one block of wood yields two fence blocks at the builder's workbench), then decide on one of two capture methods: **using a** **capture crate** or **luring animals with food**.

You can craft a **capture crate** at the farmer's workbench. This requires four pieces of wood and 50 essence of life. By holding the capture crate in your hand and left-clicking on a small animal, you will capture it. To release an animal from the capture crate, equip the crate and left-click your mouse again. No lure required!

The only downside to this method is that **only the smallest animals** can be captured, including almost any critter and baby animal. To give you an idea, here are some animals that fit inside the capture crate:

-   Calves
-   Lambs
-   Foal
-   Rabbits (all sizes)
-   Baby pigs
-   Baby swine
-   Mice
-   Frogs
-   Meerkats
-   Armadillos

To **lure animals** in _Hytale_, you must tame them with their favorite food (more on that below). Once that's done, hold their favorite food or a feed bag to make them follow you. You can **craft a feed bag** at the farmer's workbench (tier 1) for 10 wheat, 10 essence of life, five vegetables, and five fruits.

Since you can only lure tamed animals, that excludes every untameable creature, such as sabertooths, bears, or wolves. Furthermore, while luring allows you to capture larger animals than the capture crate, you'll have to lead them back to your base, which is more time-consuming.

## How to tame animals in Hytale

To tame an animal, **hold the correct type of food** in your hand, approach the wild animal, and press the F button. If you interact with a tameable animal without holding the correct food, their food type will be shown above their head. If the animal can't be tamed, no food info will appear.

To make the process of matching food types to animals a bit easier, here's an overview of all tameable animals in _Hytale_ along with their food preferences:

**Food type**

**Animal**

Carrot

Rabbits (with or without horns), horses

Corn

Chickens and turkeys

Turnip

Pigs

Pumpkin

Boars

Lettuce

Sheep and cows

Potato

Mosshorns

Onion

Warthogs

Tomato

Camels

Apple

Goats, rams, and mouflons

Cauliflower

Bison

Chili

Skrills (red desert birds)

Aubergine (eggplant)

Wild pigs (hairy pigs)

Cotton

Desert chickens

So, even though you can't breed animals yet, you can keep them as farm animals or cute pets. Since reproduction isn't possible though, it's best to hunt wild animals to [gather hides and leather](https://www.polygon.com/hytale-light-medium-heavy-hide-leather-how-to-get/) in _Hytale_'s current state. Once breeding mechanics are added to _Hytale,_ this guide will be updated.
