She won't be defying gravity for long

## Overwatch players pissed about Jetpack Cat's ultimate don't realize there's an easy way out

Look at any [_Overwatch_](https://www.polygon.com/overwatch/) forum with a post that mentions [Jetpack Cat](https://www.polygon.com/overwatch-jetpack-cat-new-hero/) in the title, and there's a high chance it's a complaint or full of grumpy comments. Sometimes, it's about her [ridiculous supply of fuel](https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1r0a1s6/im_calling_it_now_jetpack_cat_will_be_reworked/), which should probably be adjusted in future patches, and [tiny hitbox](https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1r1nfzv/jetpack_cat_is_broken/). Mostly, [it's](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/yeah-the-cat-ult-needs-nuked/1000495) [about](https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1r1iuj4/jetpack_cat_has_a_massive_issue/) [her](https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1qw0m2h/jetpack_cats_kit_is_ridiculous/) [ultimate](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/i-actually-like-jetpack-cat-but/1001072), which should absolutely _not_ be adjusted in future patches. Yes, it's annoying when you catch the cat bus to hell before realizing what hit you, but there are a lot of ways to block or cancel it. It just takes teamwork and the right abilities.

One method is to just not get hit, which is less "Rule 1: don't die" than it sounds — unless you're Sigma or a tank with absolutely no movement abilities. Anyway, Jetpack Cat lets out a telltale yowl before she pounces, and this happens after she's already locked on. That means there's no chance of her changing direction at the last moment. So unless she's at ground level and close by, you've got about a second to use a mobility skill — or something like Anran's Dancing Blaze that lets you evade attacks — and get out of the way.

If the pounce connects? Turns out there are a lot of ways to get your teammate back. Any ability that stuns or hinders an enemy will cancel Jetpack Cat's ultimate, even if they're flying off with your friend into the sunset (although it's probably not a great idea to cancel it if they're already off the edge of the map). These include:

-   Orisa's javelin
-   Cassidy's flashbang
-   Sombra's hacking skill and EMP ult
-   Mizuki's chain
-   Ana's sleep dart
-   Domina's sonic repulsors, if you're really lucky and have a nearby wall to throw the cat at
-   Roadhog's hook
-   Doomfist's rocket punch
-   Mauga's cage fight ultimate
-   Hazard's downpour ultimate

There are other possible options, though you'd need _really_ good timing. Like Reinhardt's charge or earth shatter, Brigitte's shield bash, Wuyang's tidal blast, and Mei's blizzard. These are doable! But in a "once in a blue moon" kind of way.

Your team has a few supporters who can lend a hand as well. Lifeweaver's life grip snatches an ally out of Jetpack Cat's claws, assuming you're within range, and can even work after the tether ends and the cat drops them into the abyss. Your own Jetpack Cat can also activate a lifeline tether after the drop to pick them up. The catnapped ally needs to accept the grapple, of course, so hopefully they're paying attention.

And if _you're_ the one being carried through the air against your will, you can fight back. Fire off some hits, and depending on who you're playing as, you've got a good chance of eliminating Jetpack Cat before they complete the drop.

Skilled Jetpack Cat players almost always target your team's tank (or whichever player is causing the most trouble for the opposition). So if you're playing as a character who can counter Jetpack Cat (which you should be, if your opponent is fielding one) make sure you're keeping an eye on your most-likely-to-be-targeted teammates.

Blizzard [wants to make team play a bigger focus of _Overwatch_'s future](https://www.polygon.com/overwatch-2-halloween-event-season-19-haunted-masquerade-hero-fantasy/), and figuring out how to deal with Jetpack Cat's ultimate is part of that. Friction that [rewards you for learning how to use character kits effectively](https://www.polygon.com/overwatch-season-1-best-new-hero-emre/) is a good thing. I hope Blizzard remembers that when the (probably) inevitable Jetpack Cat balance changes start rolling out.
