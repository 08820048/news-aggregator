Marvel's Spider-Man developer Insomniac Games has set expectations ahead of [tomorrow's big State of Play broadcast from PlayStation](https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-playstation-state-of-play-broadcast-for-this-week), as anticipation mounts for a fresh look at its upcoming Wolverine game.

Sony's State of Play show is due to air tomorrow, February 12 at 2pm Pacific / 5pm Eastern / 10pm UK time, and run for at least 60 minutes — suggesting PlayStation has plenty up its sleeves.

But will we get a new flash of adamantium during the showcase? Perhaps not. Overnight, Insomniac Games has posted on social media to lay out when we'll next see more of [Marvel's Wolverine](https://www.ign.com/games/marvels-wolverine) — seemingly ruling out any big reveal this week.

When asked "when more info" by a fan, Insomniac Games' official account has now [responded](https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/2021332733998612529?s=20): "spring 2026."

With spring not due to start for another month, that answer seems decisive. Still the news is perhaps surprising, considering the fact that Insomniac appeared to [drop a pretty obvious hint at Daredevil being in the game](https://www.ign.com/articles/some-kind-of-fancy-lawyer-lingo-marvels-wolverine-developer-just-dropped-a-big-tease-for-another-hero-fans-believe) only last week, and the fact that [this month's leaked PlayStation Plus games apparently will include Insomniac's Spider-Man 2](https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-plus-february-2026-extra-and-premium-games-include-sony-blockbuster-spider-man-2) (which would have been a nice chaser to a new Wolverine trailer). But perhaps Sony is instead planning a dedicated Marvel's Wolverine State of Play to show the game in the months to come?

[Sony's last major State of Play broadcast, held back in September 2025](https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-playstation-state-of-play-september-2025-everything-announced), finally treated fans to a [proper reveal of Wolverine gameplay](https://www.ign.com/articles/sonys-ps5-exclusive-wolverine-game-finally-gets-gameplay-reveal-at-state-of-play-2025), at least. The game is likely PlayStation's biggest first-party launch of the year — and, of course, [we're already tracking all of its Marvel Easter eggs](https://www.ign.com/articles/all-the-marvel-easter-eggs-in-insomniacs-wolverine-trailer). As a reminder, Wolverine currently sits with a vague-ish launch window for the second half of 2026 — though when this will be narrowed down further, we'll just have to wait and see.
