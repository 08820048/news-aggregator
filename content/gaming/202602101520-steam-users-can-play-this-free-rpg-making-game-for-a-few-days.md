Like the [Epic Games Store](https://www.polygon.com/epic-games-store-free-games-pc-february-5-botany-manor/), Steam routinely makes unexpected games available for free. Sometimes to own forever, other times to play for free for a limited time. Currently available for a free limited-time trial is _RPG Maker MZ_.

[_RPG Maker MZ_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1096900/RPG_Maker_MZ/) isn't so much a game, per se, but rather a toolkit for you to start making your own games. It boasts "no programming knowledge required" as it provides you with the means and tutorials to experiment with making your own old-school RPG.

Included is a map editor with map tiles you can paint over to customize, a character generator to remix the look of your original characters, and a variety of pre-made assets for you to tinker with. They include music, sprites, map tiles, and more.

Released in 2020, _RPG Maker MZ_ is the latest PC title in the long-running series. (_RPG Maker With_ was released on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PS5 in 2024.) It has a "Very Positive" rating on Steam with over 1,750 reviews, showing that it's a great way for people to start experiemnting with developing games.

It's free to play until Feb. 16, at 1 p.m. EST. If you want to own _RPG Maker MZ_ in full after the free trial ends, it has also received a 60% discount and is priced at $31.99 until Feb. 23.

Last week, survival game [_Arabian Gulf_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3744480/Arabian_Gulf/) was free to claim, while other games like [_XCOM 2_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/268500/XCOM_2/) and [_Hellcard_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1201540/HELLCARD/) held free play trials like _RPG Maker MZ_ currently is. Polygon will update this post regularly throughout the month when new games become available for free on Steam.
