The cozy times are over in the Northern Plateau. A promotional image for the upcoming episode of [_Frieren: Beyond Journey's End_ season 2](https://www.polygon.com/frieren-season-2-episode-1-review-impressions/) teases that the titular elven mage, along with her apprentice Fern and the warrior Stark, will soon come face-to-face with a proper villain for the first time this season.

_Frieren_ is a show built on slow pace and lyrism, where most episodes show the group taking on apparently small tasks on their journey to Aureole. After all, the series takes place many years after the Demon King was defeated, and the world is, for the most part, at peace. However, as [season 1](https://www.polygon.com/anime/24108680/frieren-beyond-journeys-end-review/) showed, this unique approach doesn't mean that _Frieren_ is fully devoid of action and dangers. The demons are still lurking, and while they may have lost their leader, some powerful individuals have survived, including a few of the former generals of the Demon King.

\[**Ed. note:** Spoilers ahead for future episodes of _Frieren: Beyond Journey's End_ season 2\]

The menacing demon lurking in the background of the promotional image is Revolte, a powerful general who will be the antagonist of an upcoming mini-arc in the series. The image shows that Frieren's party will also meet Methode again, a fellow participant in the first-class mage exam, along with Genau, another first-class mage who was a proctor in the exam. The two have been tasked with exterminating demons in the Rufen Region of the Northern Plateau.

The Divine Revolte Arc will begin on Feb. 27, [according to anime news website Natalie](https://natalie.mu/comic/news/660079). This means that _Frieren_ will go on a one-week break, but it will come back with a new, exciting arc with plenty of action and new and returning characters.
