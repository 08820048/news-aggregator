Roblox has said that a [performance of Bruno Mars's new single](https://www.roblox.com/events/5740888218927704) in the platform's user-created Steal A Brainrot mode attracted 12.8 million concurrent users, which it described as a "single artist record for most-watched virtual concert" on the platform. The activation issued custom "Brunito Marsito" brainrot collectibles to attendees, who accumulated a total of 5,428,644 of them.

Mars performed new single “I Just Might” and previous hit “Locked Out of Heaven” in the Steal a Brainrot game, although using standard Roblox character design and animation rather than the custom motion capture used for [Lil Nas X's performance on the platform](https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/54951670) back in 2020.

The performance was watched by 10 million livestream users in 14 countries and generated 53 million social video views, the company said. The total concurrent user count beats the [Guinness World Record entry of 12.3 million for a Travis Scott concert in free-to-play rival Fortnite in 2020](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/563742-largest-music-concert-in-a-videogame), although Epic subsequently claimed a 14.3 million concurrent users for its last major music activation, the [Eminem/Snoop/JuiceWrld/Ice Spice event in 2024](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/snoop-eminem-ice-spice-juice-wrld-take-over-fortnite-battle-royale-in-chapter-2-remix).

Last year Mars [appeared as a performer](https://www.fortnite.com/news/bruno-mars-is-home-in-fortnite-festival-season-9) in [Fortnite Festival](https://www.fortnite.com/@epic/festival-main-stage), the 2023 Harmonix-produced rhythm game, which enables players to perform licenced songs in a similar style to the company's previous Rock Band titles. It has featured many recent touring acts including Billie Eilish, The Weeknd and Sabrina Carpenter.

"Roblox games are living worlds that constantly evolve to keep players engaged," said Jessica Meehan, Music Partnerships Lead at Roblox. "Artist activations add a fresh layer of culture to these experiences, giving players something new to discover while helping creators attract new audiences and spark conversation beyond the platform. Music already plays a powerful role in how communities form on Roblox, and we’re focused on making it easier for creator teams of all sizes to bring music and IP into their worlds in authentic ways."

Roblox had previously [signed a deal with Sony Music to feature the label's artists](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/roblox-pens-deal-with-sony-music-entertainment). The platform recently rolled out [mandatory age checks for all users of in-game chat](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/roblox-rolls-out-global-age-checks-for-any-user-wanting-to-use-its-chat-feature), following [persistent criticism about children being exposed to disturbing material on the platform](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/14/risks-children-roblox-deeply-disturbing-researchers).
