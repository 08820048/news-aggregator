Resident Evil lore will make your head spin, man

## Leon may be unc in Resident Evil Requiem, but don't expect wine mom Jill anytime soon

We’re only days away from [_Resident Evil Requiem_](https://www.polygon.com/resident-evil-requiem/), the latest chapter of Capcom’s long-running survival horror series. It will introduce a new character in Grace Ashford, and also bring back [Leon S. Kennedy as an older hunk](https://www.polygon.com/resident-evil-requiem-re9-leon-s-kennedy-capcom/). It might leave you wishing you could see other heroes like Jill Valentine aged-up next, but don’t expect that anytime soon. That's thanks to the dumbest piece of lore imaginable: the leading ladies of Resident Evil age _very_ slowly.

The explanation is very convoluted, but it dates back to the 2023 animated movie [_Resident Evil: Death Island_](https://www.polygon.com/23678865/resident-evil-movie-death-island/). Set between the events of _Resident Evil 6_ and _7_, the team-up film has the series’ A-list stars going to Alcatraz to investigate a zombie outbreak. (It’s _very_ stupid, but admittedly enjoyable.) At the time, though, it raised some eyebrows as fans noticed that Jill Valentine, Claire Redfield, and Rebecca Chambers looked as though they hadn’t aged a day since the first three Resident Evil games.

You might be tempted to write that off with the explanation that video game heroes in long-running franchises don’t really age at all, but that’s not the case. In the lead-up to the film, the [Resident Evil Portal](https://x.com/REBHPortal/status/1633989354942238720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1633989354942238720%7Ctwgr%5Eab7050e7e433e0323566a74223f894071e01632f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgameranx.com%2Fupdates%2Fid%2F448633%2Farticle%2Fjill-valentines-bio-explains-why-she-doesnt-look-older-in-resident-evil-death-island%2F) account on X provided some background on Jill to set up her appearance in the film: “Fought against bio-terrorist attacks in S.T.A.R.S. alongside Chris. Her T-Virus infection has slowed her aging but left some psychological scars. She rejoins her team after rehabilitation.”

Indeed, Jill was infected with the T-Virus by Nemesis in [_Resident Evil 3_](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/3/30/21199436/resident-evil-3-remake-review-playstation-4-xbox-one-pc/), but she’s cured after Carlos injects her with a vaccine. (Vaccines retroactively cure diseases in Resident Evil, I guess!) She’s not the only one who’s been exposed to a disease like that, though. Claire Redfield? She gets hit with the fear-inducing T-Phobos Virus in _Resident Evil: Revelations 2_. And Rebecca Chambers is infected with the A-Virus in the film _Resident Evil: Vendetta_.

Thus, if we’re to follow Resident Evil logic, all three women may be showing signs of slowed aging due to their infections.

Don’t think about it too hard. Like a lot of Resident Evil lore, the explanation is wishy-washy and inconsistently handled throughout the series. [Other fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/1pkhox9/capcom_will_never_bring_back_aged_female/) have suggested that it’s just a case of the franchise reusing assets, or a societal double standard around pop culture’s hesitancy to depict older women as often as men. Whatever the actual reason may be, you probably shouldn’t expect to see cool aunt Claire or wine mom Jill in a Resident Evil game anytime soon, even if Leon is unc.

_Resident Evil Requiem_ launches on Feb. 28 for Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X.
