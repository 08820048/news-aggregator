It sounds like Sung Jin-Woo will be making a last-minute dive into Jegu Island — err, I mean, The Golden Coast, as Epic Games is currently teasing a [_Solo Leveling_](https://www.polygon.com/608028/solo-leveling-arise-overdrive-release-demo-impressions/) collaboration with [_Fortnite_](https://www.polygon.com/fortnite-south-park-event-skins-sidekicks-trailer/).

The battle royale's social media handle [on X](https://x.com/fortnite/status/2023419633550922061?s=46&t=X--pzMmnj7I-71VthkDGsg) teased the collaboration by outlining the anime's overall premise. "The weakest Hunter of all mankind. E-rank. No potential. No future…" the post says. On [Instagram Stories](https://www.instagram.com/stories/fortnite/3833909406493475912/), the Fortnite handle also teased the question, "If you were given another path, would you accept?" The text is posted behind a very _Solo Leveling_\-influenced backdrop surrounded by a blue aura, and the text itself teases how Jin-Woo gains his powers.

If you're wondering what the hell Jin-Woo and _Solo Leveling_ are, allow me to explain: _Solo Leveling_ is an anime based on a very successful Korean manhwa of the same name by Chugong and artistJang Sung-Rak. It follows a hunter named Jin-woo, who comes from a world where mysterious “Gates” connect Earth to monster-filled dungeons, and certain humans awaken as Hunters with ranked abilities to fight them. Jin-Woo, once the weakest E-rank Hunter, gains a unique power called the “System” after surviving a deadly double dungeon expedition. Unlike other Hunters, he can level up infinitely, grow stronger without limits, and use his abilities to extract and command fallen enemies as his own shadow army.

That last bit about his powers is where the collaboration comes into play. Alongside skins for Jin-Woo, Fortnite leaker account [HypeX](https://x.com/HYPEX/status/2023427447602213273), who notes the collab is expected this week, speculates that skins for Beru or Igris, two allies from Jin-Woo's shadow army, will be available, as well as fellow Hunter Cha Hae-in. _Fortnite_ is no stranger when it comes to anime collaborations ([_Dragon Ball_](https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/23307775/fortnite-x-dragon-ball-super-event-trailer-gameplay-details/), [_My Hero Academia_](https://www.polygon.com/23511312/my-hero-academia-fortnite-skins-deku-all-might/), _[Bleach](https://www.polygon.com/fortnite-winterfest-bleach-anime-harry-potter/)_, etc.), and Epic Games usually finds pretty nifty ways to incorporate abilities and iconography from the franchise into the game. It will also be interesting to see how Jin-Woo's somewhat broken ability and the equipment he's earned are applied to the skin, or whether those powers can manifest in-game.

Look out for the official announcement when it _arises_ because it's looking pretty promising _Fortnite_'s next big collab is with _Solo Leveling_. You should watch it while you can; the first season is good, but season 2 from last year was so great that it made the list of the [greatest anime of 2025](https://www.polygon.com/the-best-anime-of-2025-mha-solo-leveling-dandadan-demon-slayer/).
