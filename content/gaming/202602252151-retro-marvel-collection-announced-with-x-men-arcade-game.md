Konami's classic [X-Men](https://www.polygon.com/tag/x-men/) beat-'em-up arcade game is coming home (again) with a new release that brings together an eclectic mix of 8-bit and 16-bit Marvel video games, Konami, Marvel Games, and Limited Run Games announced Wednesday. In addition to [undeniable classic _X-Men: The Arcade Game_](https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24155680/best-x-men-video-games-board-games/), the _Marvel MaXimum Collection_ will also include titles like _Captain America and The Avengers_ and the infamous _Silver Surfer_ game for NES.

_Marvel MaXimum Collection_ includes six old-school [Marvel](https://www.polygon.com/marvel/) titles across 13 versions of those games, which were originally released for the arcade, Game Boy, Game Gear, NES, Sega Genesis, and/or Super NES. While the big draw may be Konami's influential X-Men arcade game released in 1992 — which was digitally rereleased on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 back in 2010 — there's a lot here for Spider-Man fans too. _Spider-Man/Venom: Maximum Carnage_, _Venom/Spider-Man: Separation Anxiety_, and _Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade’s Revenge_ are also included as part of the collection.

Here's a rundown of everything included in the _Marvel MaXimum Collection_:

-   _X-Men: The Arcade Game_ (Arcade)
-   _Captain America and The Avengers_ (Arcade, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, NES)
-   _Spider-Man/Venom: Maximum Carnage_ (Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive)
-   _Venom/Spider-Man: Separation Anxiety_ (Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive)
-   _Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade’s Revenge_ (Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, Game Boy, Game Gear)
-   _Silver Surfer_ (NES)

The _Marvel MaXimum Collection_ version of _X-Men: The Arcade Game_ features six-player online multiplayer with rollback netcode, which should remotely replicate the feeling of standing around a big arcade cabinet with five of your friends. And thanks to a rewind option and save states, you might actually be able to beat the notoriously difficult _Silver Surfer_ for the NES three decades later.

_Marvel MaXimum Collection_ also includes supplementary features like an Archive section that promises "high-resolution scans of original box art, instruction manuals, and vintage advertisements" to pore over, as well as a music player and display options that make the collected Marvel games look crisp and clean or heavily filtered with CRT and scanline effects.

A release date for _Marvel MaXimum Collection_ was not announced, but it will be available for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Windows PC (via Steam), and Xbox Series X "soon."

2026 will be a big one for Marvel Games, with [_Marvel's Wolverine_](https://www.polygon.com/marvel-wolverine-game-release-date-ps5-insomniac-sony/), [_Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls_](https://www.polygon.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-beta-ps5-preview/), and [_Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra_](https://www.polygon.com/24106916/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-captain-america-black-panther-game/) also pegged for release this year.
