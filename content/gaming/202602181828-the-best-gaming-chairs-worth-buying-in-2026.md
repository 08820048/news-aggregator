Gaming chairs are one of the best investments a gamer can make. After all, during those long gaming sessions, where are you going to sit? While [gaming keyboards](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-keyboard) and [gaming monitors](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-monitor) can really lift your gaming experience to the next level, none of it really matters if you don't have a comfortable chair to sit in. Our top entry, the [Secretlab Titan Evo Nanogen](https://zdcs.link/9gbdVG?object_uuid=796ee8d2-2c15-49d5-82fa-b5855dcf853a&t=article), is a perfect example: It's a chair big enough for pretty much any body, and it's comfortable and sturdy enough to sit in for hours.

## TL;DR – These Are the Best Gaming Chairs:

[I've been reviewing gaming chairs](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-gaming-chairs#how-i-test-gaming-chairs) for years, and the overall best ones you can buy provide a place to sink into for hours of gaming without fatigue or pain. Including features like customizable lumbar support, adjustable armrests, and a movable headrest to beef up the ergnomics only adds to a more comfortable, distraction-free space to focus on your favorite [PC games](https://www.ign.com/editors-choice/games/pc).

There are an excess of options to choose from. To help you out, I've cut this list down to eight tested and researched chairs offering solid frames, high-quality material, and all the creature comforts you could want.

## 1\. Secretlab Titan Evo Nanogen

### Best Gaming Chair

[![Titan Evo Nanogen](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/18/titan-1771440741096.png?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/Qx7MMO?object_uuid=796ee8d2-2c15-49d5-82fa-b5855dcf853a&t=article "Titan Evo Nanogen")

Our Top Pick

With a brand new, ultra comfy leatherette and softer seat cushion, the new Titan Evo Nanogen is the gaming chair to buy.

PROS

Comfortable and ergonomic

CONS

Backrest foam can be stiff for some

The original [Secretlab Titan Evo I reviewed](https://www.ign.com/articles/secretlab-titan-evo-2022-review) reigned supreme as my top pick since its release in 2022. With the release of the Secretlab Titan Evo Nanogen edition, that has officially changed as the new model officially slides into the top spot, and by quite a bit too. Though it might look similar from afar, all it takes is a touch to realize how much better its new leatherette and seat cushion actually are.

In the two years since the release of the original Evo, Secretlab has been hard at work developing its brand new Nanogen Hybrid Leatherette. This new material is much softer and instantly makes the chair more comfortable just by virtue of how nice it is to sit on. [In my review](https://www.ign.com/articles/secretlab-titan-evo-nanogen-edition-review), I noted that the only similar material I've felt is Brisa, an "ultrafabric" that's typically found on luxury products. The only gaming chair I've encountered with such a fabric, or that even comes close to the Titan Evo Nanogen and its sweet, sweet suppleness, is the [LF Gaming Stealth](https://lfgaming.com/collections/quick-ship/products/lfg%E2%84%A2-gaming-chair-black-quick-ship?variant=41005665452143), a luxury bucket seat that _starts_ at $1,700.

Secretlab also took gamers' feedback to heart about the firmness of its signature cold cure foam. This new model now features a Nanofoam Composite cushion on the seat, providing a layer of softness right out of the box while still providing adequate support for long gaming sessions.

The armrests also see a major upgrade. While they still feature hot-swappable top cushions thanks to their magnetic attachment system, the Nanogen comes with velour-wrapped PlushCell foam arm toppers by default. If you've ever experienced sore elbows from leaning on the arms of your gaming chair, you'll know how important this softness is. Paired with its PlushCell magnetic neck pillow, it's easily one of the most cozy gaming chairs out there. With the optional [Ergonomic Recliner add-on](https://www.ign.com/articles/secretlab-ergonomic-recliner-add-on-review), it's the only gaming chair I've ever taken a nap in.

This new model does come at a premium over the original, but it's worth every penny. It's class-leading in every way.

## 2\. Razer Iskur V2 X

### Best Budget Gaming Chair

[![Iskur V2 X](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/18/isk-1771440827426.png?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/z7OZW8?object_uuid=796ee8d2-2c15-49d5-82fa-b5855dcf853a&t=article "Iskur V2 X")

### Razer Iskur V2 X

Made to last in stylish comfort, this chair is a good long-term pick.

Product Specifications

Seat Height

16.1-20.1"

Seat Width

21"

Seat Depth

17.7"

Backrest Length

33.5"

Backrest Width

20.4"

Tilt

Up to 152°

Ergonomics

2D adjustable armrests, tilt tension, tilt recline, integrated lumbar support

Max Load

299 lbs

PROS

Steel frame and aluminum wheel base for enhanced durability

Ample cushioning trimmed in high-quality fabric upholstery

Just as stylish as more expensive gaming chairs

CONS

Lumbar isn't adjustable

No included support pillows

If you want a good gaming chair on a budget, look no further than the Razer Iskur V2 X. Coming in at $300, this chair isn't the absolute cheapest – beware the dirt-cheap chairs anyway – but it offers premium quality that's made to last years into the future. And if you plan on using it while you stream, its good looks make it the perfect complement to your face cam.

When [I reviewed this chair](https://www.ign.com/articles/razer-iskur-v2-x-gaming-chair-review), I was very impressed at how Razer prioritized long-term durability and build quality with this release. Its fabric upholstery is soft but tough with a tight weave to withstand rigorous use. Beneath that fabric and the layer of cushion beneath, there's a rugged steel frame – not the usual low quality fiberboard typical of budget gaming chairs – so you don't need to worry about an untimely break as you kick back to put your feet up. The wheelbase has also been upgraded from the usual plastic to aluminum, eliminating another source of breakage.

This chair is also comfortable straight out of the box with dense but soft cushions and comfy fabrics. It doesn't come with any kind of pillows, so you'll need to pick those up separately if you're looking for a little bit of extra support. But for my back, the integrated lumbar curve did the trick even over long-term gaming sessions.

Can you spend less on a gaming chair? Sure, but around this price, the Razer Iskur V2 X blends exceptional build quality with comfort and style in a way few others do. Even if you have to save up a little more, it's worth waiting on.

## 3\. Libernovo Omni Dynamic Ergo Chair

### Best Ergonomic Gaming Chair

[![Omni](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/18/ln-1771440923983.png?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/9gjBgD?object_uuid=796ee8d2-2c15-49d5-82fa-b5855dcf853a&t=article "Omni")

### Libernovo Omni

The most innovative chair of the year (and one of the most comfortable too!)

Product Specifications

Total Height

45.7" - 49.7"

Total Width

31.2

Total Depth

19.7"

Height Range

17” - 21”

Max Load

300 lbs

Warranty

5 years (chair), 2 years (electronics)

Key Features

Powered lumbar adjustment, triple layer comfort/support design, zoned support, 4D armrests, fully adjustable/removable headrest, adjustable seat height, adjustable recline, differential tilt and recline,

PROS

Exceptionally comfortable and supportive

Lots of adjustments to meet your specific needs

Powered lumbar adjustment with a refresh back stretching feature

Dynamic tilt and recline provide support that follows your movements

Comes with a separate footrest (and it's great)

CONS

Requires charging for full functionality (but it's not frequent)

Warranty is shorter than more established luxury brands

While I didn't review this one personally, I've tested it alongside [our reviewer, Bill Loguidice](https://www.ign.com/articles/libernovo-omni-review), and wholeheartedly agree with this conclusion: This chair is excellent. It comes with all of the adjustments you would expect from a high-end ergonomic chair but adds its own unique, battery-powered innovation that puts it over the top. If you're looking for an ergonomic chair that offers support and comfort even for the longest gaming sessions, look no further.

Omni is a fitting name for this chair, because it offers adjustable support in all of the areas you would need it most. Its dynamic lumbar system allows the back and armrests to move with you, so you're completely supported whether you're sitting bolt upright or are leaning back with your feet up on its included footrest.

Height, recline, tilt tension, and sitting angle are all adjustable. The armrests are 4D, so you can maneuver them forward and back, in and out, up and down, or twist them at an angle to support your elbows when gaming with a controller. The headrest is also completely adjustable, so you can dial in the exact position – including depth – that offers you the most comfort in the moment.

The chair's defining feature, however, is its powered lumbar support. While most gaming chairs use power for RGB or gimmicks like butt fans and usually leave you with an ugly cable that is perpetually at risk of being crush by its casters, the Libernovo Omni eschews all of that entirely. Instead, it uses its power system to drive its lumbar support, moving a piston in and out to the exact depth you need to sit comfortably with good posture. And since it uses a rechargeable battery that can be removed and replenished with a standard USB Type-C cable, there's no intrusive cable to worry about either.

One of the biggest surprises this chair offered me was its back stretch feature. You're intended to lean all the way back and press a dedicated button on the left arm rest to trigger this mode. When you do, the piston slowly cycles in and out, giving you a satisfying series of stretches. In truth, this seemed a bit gimmicky at first but it's genuinely comfy and a great way to add a little "me time" into your day. Innovative in all the right ways, the Libernovo Omni is an absolute winner.

## 4\. Hinomi H2 Pro

### Best Mesh Gaming Chair

[![H2 Pro](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/16/hinomi-small-1771200238342.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/aD8dyX?object_uuid=796ee8d2-2c15-49d5-82fa-b5855dcf853a&t=article "H2 Pro")

### Hinomi H2 Pro

The kind of sequel we love to see. This chair is breathable, comfortable, better built, and even more adjustable than the original.

Product Specifications

Backrest Height

24.4-33.9"

Seat Height

18-22.8”

Seat Width

20.8"

Seat Depth

16.7-19.9”

Tilt

136°

Ergonomics

4-point headrest adjustment, 5-point lumbar adjustment, tilt angle and tension, 6D armrests, seat depth, leg rest length, height

Max Load

330 lbs

PROS

Fantastic support via 19 different adjustments

The most adjustable arms this side of the Steelcase Gesture (and more, in some ways)

Can be tucked completely out of the way

Much improved build quality compared to the original

CONS

This many supports takes some time to dial in

Doesn’t accommodate cross-legged sitting posture

The mesh gaming chair market is dominated by [office chairs](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-office-chair). That might seem strange, but when you think about it, these chairs have been designed for intense desk use for decades – what better for PC gamers who want to frag the night away? That’s where the Hinomi H2 Pro comes in.

My review is currently in the works, but I’ve spent enough time with the H2 Pro, and its predecessor the H1 Pro, to know that this is a mesh chair that’s worth paying attention to. It’s one of the most adjustable and versatile seats on the market, which happens to make it especially well-suited for gamers and anyone who might want to reclaim some of the space that might be taken up by a traditional gaming chair.

Just about every aspect of this chair is adjustable. In true ergo-chair form, you can adjust the height, seat depth, rocking tension, lumbar support, and neck rest to ensure your unique anatomy is perfectly supported. The depth of some of its adjustments is truly impressive, however. The neck rest, which typically only adjusts up and down on most mesh chairs, adds depth and angle adjustment to the mix, mastering its neck support across any position you might want to sit or recline in.

And if you’re anything like me, you’ll definitely find yourself reclining – usually with a controller in your hand. That’s because the H2 Pro can be equipped with a foldaway footrest. It’s an added purchase, but at around $40 at the time of writing, it’s worth the extra cost. Its padded supports are comfortable and shift to be completely out of the way when not in use.

The arm rests and back rests are also unique in that each can completely fold out of the way. The armrests offer full-dimensional movement, including a significantly expanded height range and the ability to tilt up and down, which I’ve never seen before. When you don’t need them, they fold up and completely out of the way, making it perfect for activities like playing an instrument. The backrest, in addition to offering excellent and highly adjustable lumbar and thoracic support, can be unlocked and folded down so the chair can fit completely under a desk. The space savings might be small, but if you’re using the chair in a small room like a dorm or home office, that small touch can make a big difference in perceived space – and is way better if you game in VR and don’t fancy smacking that headrest in a match of Gorn.

Compared to the H1 Pro, the H2 Pro is a significant improvement both in features and build quality. It’s the kind of sequel I love to see in the gaming chair world, one that incorporates user feedback from the original, offers meaningful upgrades, and doesn’t come with a big price hike. If you weren’t already considering it before, you definitely should now.

## 5\. Razer Iskur V2 NewGen

### Most Breathable (Non-Mesh) Gaming Chair

[![Iskur V2 NewGen](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/16/razer-sm-1771200258166.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/9gXl1y?object_uuid=796ee8d2-2c15-49d5-82fa-b5855dcf853a&t=article "Iskur V2 NewGen")

### Razer Iskur V2 NewGen

An iteration on an already great chair, more breathable and cool than ever.

Product Specifications

Seat Height

17.1-21.1”

Seat Width

20.9”

Seat Depth

17.7"

Backrest Length

33.7"

Backrest Width

21.3”

Tilt

154° maximum recline

Ergonomics

Adjustable lumbar arch, precise shoulder arch, 4D armrests, neck pillow

Max Load

300 lbs

PROS

Supportive, highly adjustable lumbar

Softer cushioning thanks to dual-density foam

More breathable, cooler EPU fabric

Armrests feature extended height adjustment range

CONS

Cooling benefits will be less apparent in cooler settings

My review of this chair is still upcoming, but I've been testing it for long enough to say that it's a more comfortable and breathable iteration of the Iskur V2, an already great gaming chair. It's a better fit for out-of-the-box comfort and anyone who needs to beat the heat while gaming.

For the most part, this is the same great chair we recommended previously. The biggest changes come with the new dual-density fabric in the seat, which immediately makes the chair feel softer without the usual break-in period. It's a subtle change, but given the choice between the original foam and the new formulation, I would take the Iskur V2 NewGen every time.

While I would have loved to see a fabric version of this chair released at launch, its new breathable Gen-2 EPU leather makes it one of the coolest gaming chairs this side of mesh fabric. While the company doesn’t share many specific details about how it works, it claims that this new material features CoolTouch technology. In practice, it offers better airflow and a cooling sensation, especially when the temperatures get hot. Think cooling gel with more air movement.

Ergonomically, the Iskur V2 NewGen has got it on lock, carrying through every feature from the original. You still get the excellent “6D” lumbar support that can be precisely positioned for enhanced comfort, the same deep 152-degree recline, 4D armrests with soft elbow-friendly pads, tilt tensioning, angle lock, and one of the best memory foam neck pillows in the business.

While we might still be waiting for the inevitable V3, the Iskur V2 NewGen takes the V2, which I called superb in [my review](https://www.ign.com/articles/razer-iskur-v2-gaming-chair-review), and makes it even better.

## 6\. Secretlab Titan Evo Nanogen XL

### Best Big and Tall Gaming Chair

[![Titan Evo Nanogen XL](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/30/slsm-1743366907221.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/QKg14j?object_uuid=796ee8d2-2c15-49d5-82fa-b5855dcf853a&t=article "Titan Evo Nanogen XL")

### Secretlab Titan Evo Nanogen XL

Taller, wider, and just as supportive as our top pick.

Product Specifications

Seat Height

18.1-21.9"

Seat Width

19.3"

Seat Depth

19.7"

Backrest Length

35"

Backrest Width

22"

Tilt

85-165°

Ergonomics

4D adjustable armrests, lumbar support, magnetic head pillow, memory foam with cooling gel

Max Load

395 lbs

PROS

Wide, well-cushioned seat

Soft and comfortable yet still supportive

Sturdy aluminum wheelbase

CONS

Pricier than the smaller model

The Secretlab Titan Evo Nanogen XL is a clear winner for the [best big and tall gaming chair](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-big-and-tall-gaming-chairs). I've been recommending the Titan Evo since its original launch several years ago, but with the Nanogen Edition, the company has taken comfort to the next level (which is also why it's my No. 1 pick for overall gaming chair). The XL version just upsizes that to deliver its comfort to a wider audience.

This version takes everything from the normal-sized version and carries it through. That means you'll get the exceptionally soft, Brisa-like fabric and extra seat cushion, as well as those gloriously plush yet still somehow supportive armrests. If you're a larger person, then you know how important proper back support is, and this delivers that too with its adjustable lumbar support.

It also features full compatibility with the company's different magnetic accessories for the standard Titan Evo XL. There are magnetic pillows and different armrest covers and, though not magnetic, you can also attach the company's new recliner accessory to put your feet up and kick back with the controller.

This chair doesn't come cheap, but believe me when I say that it's worth every penny when stacked up against other gaming chairs attempting similar levels of support and comfort. Secretlab has been an industry leader for a reason, and the Nanogen line is easily the best it has ever produced.

## 7\. Respawn 900 Gaming Recliner

### Best Gaming Chair with a Footrest

[![900 Gaming Recliner](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/10/respawnsm-1746920874371.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/QVX4V3?object_uuid=796ee8d2-2c15-49d5-82fa-b5855dcf853a&t=article "900 Gaming Recliner")

### Respawn 900 Gaming Recliner

The perfect chair for putting your feet back and kicking back with a recliner, it offers plenty of options at a reasonable price.

Product Specifications

Seat Height

18.1"

Seat Width

21.3"

Seat Depth

22.4"

Backrest Height

33.5"

Backrest Width

20.5"

Tilt

135° recline

Ergonomics/Extra Features

360° swivel, 135° recline, backrest and recline operate independently, built-in cupholder, removeable storage pouch, included headrest pillow

Max Load

275 lbs

PROS

Soft cushioning, perfect for relaxing with your feet up

Independent control of backrest and recliner

Full swivel

Leather and fabric options

CONS

Height can be low for some desks

Finding a great gaming chair with a quality footrest is more challenging than you would expect. While plenty of chairs that come with footrests, they are mostly carbon copies of one another, and very few of them offer the kind of seamless quality as my go-to pick: the Respawn 900 Gaming Recliner.

When it comes to [affordable gaming chairs](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-budget-gaming-chair), Respawn has been one of the go-to brands over the last five years or so. That doesn't mean they are cheaply made or poor quality, however. In fact, it has been the exact opposite that has made them such a popular choice among gamers that don't want to spend $500 or more on their gaming throne. I was delighted to find this chair, which not only breaks the mold set by other gaming chairs on the market, but evolves it into a hybrid between a typical racing-style gaming chair and a full-on recliner.

Coming in around $400, this chair features a wide footrest that combines with the seat with a single upholstered layer. It offers separate controls for the footrest, recliner, and backrest, so you can cater your sitting style to your mood with more precision. It's the perfect chair for kicking back with a controller and could even fit into a bedroom or living room without a PC if you count yourself among the console faithful.

This design, which is a racing chair from the backrest up into a recliner from the armrests and seat down, has other benefits that most gaming chairs just don't offer. The armrests are wide and thickly padded. There's a cup holder built into the left armrest and a removable pouch that can be used to store a remote controller, or even some snacks. It's also available in your choice of PU leather or fabric in a number of different styles to match your taste. Of course, such a different design also has some trade-offs. The biggest consideration is that it's not height adjustable and features stationary armrests (like a recliner). Some users have found that it sits too low for their desk. At 18.1 inches, it's about the same as a normal gaming chair in its lowest position.

If you're looking for a middle ground that can deliver for PC and console gaming alike, I think this is a reasonable trade-off. And if you need a little extra height, you can pick up my [favorite riser cushion](https://zdcs.link/zJgwMe?object_uuid=796ee8d2-2c15-49d5-82fa-b5855dcf853a&t=article) to gain those extra inches to sit comfortably at your desk.

## 8\. Secretlab Titan Evo (Small)

### Best Gaming Chair for Shorter Gamers

[![Titan Evo (Small) ](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/18/nan-1771441059872.png?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/985pYd?object_uuid=796ee8d2-2c15-49d5-82fa-b5855dcf853a&t=article "Titan Evo (Small) ")

PROS

All the features of the larger Titan Evo in a small form factor

Solid ergonomic support for long gaming sessions

Excellent build quality and durability over time

CONS

Not available with new Nanogen materials (yet?)

Secretlab chairs come at a premium

If you're on the smaller side, many gaming chairs can make you feel like you're swimming. If that describes you, then you're in luck. The best gaming chair, the Secretlab Titan Evo, has a version designed especially for you. It's one of the few major brands to offer a variant specifically dedicated to shorter gamers and offers all of the same ergonomic comfort and durability benefits, as well as the unique sense of style the brand is known for.

It's important to note that this version does not feature the upgrades of the new Nanogen Edition. It follows the same proven design of the Secretlab Titan Evo 2022 that I reviewed and fell in love with. I wouldn't be surprised if a Nanogen Edition came out in the future, which would easily take this spot due to the softness of the new material, but that doesn't take away from how good this chair is.

In fact, apart from the additional foam layer on the seat and the new upholstery, nearly all of the same features apply here. My specific pick goes to the SoftWeave fabric version for its added softness and breathability. But even if you go with Secretlab's Neo Hybrid Leatherette, you'll be able to count on four-way lumbar support, soft memory foam arm cushions, and an equally plush magnetic neck pillow that won't push your neck forward and actually enhances its comfort.

It's also a bit cheaper, which is nice, especially if you pick it up directly from [Secretlab's website](https://zdcs.link/9YWwrn?object_uuid=796ee8d2-2c15-49d5-82fa-b5855dcf853a&t=article). No matter who you buy from, you can count on a chair that's made to last and comes with a three-year warranty that can be boosted to five years by sharing a picture of your new chair online.

## How I Test to Find the Best Gaming Chairs

Over the years, I've been lucky enough to test and review more office and gaming chairs than most people will ever use for extended periods in their whole lifetime. This breadth of experience, as well as hours and hours of research and education, gives me a unique perspective and ability to cut through the fluff and get to what matters most in a good chair: quality and comfort, each befitting the wide range of price points you’ll find in the market.

Like most industries, the world of seating is full of bold claims about performance, ergonomics, and features. Whether they actually deliver on these promises is another matter entirely. I put each chair I review through thorough testing, both for general categories like ergonomics, comfort, and adjustability, as well as specific examination of unique features and claims for individual products.

One of the first things I look at is how each chair arrives upon delivering. Each chair should be well packed, protected, and secured within the parcel to make sure they aren't shifting around in transit, subject to tears or scuffs from parts rubbing against each other. This is also an indicator of care and attention to detail from the part of the manufacturer.

I then go through the assembly process, taking photographs of each step along the way for comparison against other similar or price-competitive products. During this process, I look at a number of elements, including the ease of assembly, if it can be done by one person, if tools are required and/or provided, and how much guidance and support the manufacturer offers for new builders. This process also allows me to get a very close look at each piece of the chair from every angle so I can examine often overlooked qualities such as the stitching, embroidery, and how well the fabric is attached and mechanisms come together beneath the chair. These details are often out of sight and out of mind but speak to build quality and long-term durability.

With the chair built, I perform a thorough assessment of the adjustments, how easily each can be made while sitting, and determine how they compare to other similar features from other brands. If you have to stand up to make an adjustment, that’s extra time wasted. But, above all, it’s important to make sure everything that can be tailored to my anatomy and preferences is before forming a judgment, even if it takes more trial and error to dial it in properly.

After that, it’s down and dirty use testing. I test chairs in as many settings and use cases as possible before rendering a judgment. This means full work days at a desk, gaming with a mouse and keyboard as well as a controller, leaning back and relaxing, leaving forward with my elbows pressing into the armrests, and more. I’m looking to see how well it maintains both comfort and support across each of these scenarios.

This process takes time, but that extra experience is important. Often, chairs can seem great at first but after a week or two of actual use, their shortcomings become apparent. A soft cushion seat cushion can give a pleasant first impression, but if you wind up feeling the frame when you position yourself in just the right way, or experience back pain after several days of normal use, those are major problems that may or may not be readily apparent.

My goal in all of this is to make sure that you’re making the right investment for you. A great gaming chair doesn’t have to cost an arm and a leg, but they’re rarely cheap. Such an investment deserves scrutiny and I’m here to save you that effort before a single cent leaves your bank account.

This will probably be the biggest determining factor. Going out with a set budget is helpful, as you’ll find chairs ranging from under $50 to more than $1,000. Cheaper gaming chairs, like the [Corsair TC100 Relaxed](https://zdcs.link/A4Wdq?_ga=549648315.1689878480&object_uuid=796ee8d2-2c15-49d5-82fa-b5855dcf853a&t=article), still deliver the comfort of more expensive ones. You just need to be prepared to sacrifice features, like 4D armrests or adjustable lumbar support. I’d stay away from anything under $100, especially if the chair makes promises that appear too good to be true.

### **Design**

Comfort is king; nobody wants to spend hours in a seat that causes back or neck pain. Finding a chair that’s the right size for you is essential for preventing discomfort. Luckily, most chairs list their dimensions. You’ll want a wide, well-cushioned seat, a long backrest, and a good range of height adjustability. All that should sit on a sturdy metal frame capable of holding your full body weight. If you’re looking into a racing-style chair with bucket seats, like the [AndaSeat Kaiser 3](https://zdcs.link/oP3v6?_ga=549648315.1689878480&object_uuid=796ee8d2-2c15-49d5-82fa-b5855dcf853a&t=article), pay special mind to the bolsters, as they can dig into your thighs.

### **Materials**

For the most part, gaming chairs offer PU leather, fabric, or mesh. PU leather is easy to clean but may not always be super durable, and it gets hot when wearing shorts. Fabric, which is used on the [E-Win Champion](https://zdcs.link/jPv2q?_ga=549648315.1689878480&object_uuid=796ee8d2-2c15-49d5-82fa-b5855dcf853a&t=article), won’t be as easy to clean, though it’s less of a heat magnet. Mesh is the most breathable option. However, you’ll lose the cushioned seat and backrest in favor of a suspension system, which can be a hit or miss. The [Razer Fujin Pro](https://zdcs.link/5O0qx?_ga=549648315.1689878480&object_uuid=796ee8d2-2c15-49d5-82fa-b5855dcf853a&t=article) is one chair that gets mesh right.

### **Ergonomics**

After locking those in, a movable headrest, adjustable armrests, and customizable lumbar support can enhance the chair’s ergonomic, but these features often make the chair more expensive. Other quality-of-life additions, like a tilting or rocking mechanism, also help with relaxation between heated gaming sessions.

## Gaming Chair FAQ

### What's the point of a gaming chair?

Because gaming chairs are glorified office chairs, their main selling points are, frankly, aesthetic. Gaming chairs are often a bit more expensive than comparable office chairs and don't have the same comfort features as seats designed for working in all day. Still, if you love the way that gaming chairs look and you're going for a certain vibe in your gaming den, the best gaming chairs do truly shine. You just might want to look at the [best ergonomic chairs](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ergonomic-office-chairs) if you want something that's truly going to take care of your aching back.

### How much should you spend on a a gaming chair?

While you can buy a gaming chair for $80 or less, doing so is just asking for eventual pain. Something inexpensive is usually nothing more than a cheap plastic frame (versus steel) with some thin fabric or pleather upholstery on top.

You can get a quality chair for as little as $200, and that’s the absolute bottom floor of affordability we’d go for. **Spending $300 or more will get you access to better options**. If your budget allows you to soar a bit higher, more expensive gaming chairs start to come with built-in lumbar support, cooling gel layers, and even more adjustable ergonomics, not to mention RGB LED Kits and more. It all depends on what matters most to you in the long term.

### Should you get a [gaming chair or an office chair](https://www.ign.com/articles/gaming-chair-vs-office-chair)?

While there are benefits to both, this is a subjective question and boils down to what you're looking for. If you're after looks and the ability to deeply recline, a gaming chair is a safe bet. If you're looking for a chair that places ergonomics first and has lots of adjustments, you'll have more luck with an office chair. It's important to note, however, that there's plenty of crossover between the two. The [Steelcase Gesture,](https://zdcs.link/z7bOmV?object_uuid=796ee8d2-2c15-49d5-82fa-b5855dcf853a&t=article) for example, would look fantastic on any stream but it's an office chair, through and through. The [Mavix M9](https://zdcs.link/lVG3r?object_uuid=796ee8d2-2c15-49d5-82fa-b5855dcf853a&t=article), on the other hand, is clearly a gaming chair but has the features and adjustments of premium office chairs. Consider what you value most, how long you'll be sitting in the chair, and what adjustments you would prefer. From there, you can find chairs in either category to meet your needs.

### What’s the best brand of gaming chair?

Your classic gaming brands like Razer and Corsair have been known to make mean chairs. Otherwise, brands like Secretlab, Razer, and Corsair consistently deliver comfortable, well-built seats that blend comfort and durability across price points. More classic ergo brands like Herman-Miller, Steelcase, and Haworth have begun releasing chairs for gamers too. Though expensive, those chairs are made with the best materials and are full of ergonomic features allowing them to offer superior support and comfort. Be wary of some brands available only on Amazon: The most inexpensive options will most likely be a little janky. It's probably worth it to save up and spend extra on a more notable brand.
