Developer Embark Studios has published [Arc Raiders](https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders) update 1.15.0, adding a new PvE-focused event and new rewards while (finally) squashing an infamous duplication glitch.

Patch notes posted to [its official website](https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-15-0) detail what is a surprisingly hefty update ahead of February’s Shrouded Sky content drop. While fans continue to wait for a new Arc threat and Raider Deck, today’s changes bring back a fan-favorite event while delivering a new mode with its own set of cosmetics to unlock.

Arc Raiders players who drop into Speranza will find Shared Watch as update 1.15.0’s most notable addition. The limited-time event, which ends February 24, asks Raiders to team up with friends and strangers against Arc to earn merits. Merits unlock rewards that range from tools like a Vita Spray or acoustic guitar to permanent unlocks like the Slugger set or even a little rooster-sized helmet for Scrappy. Killing Arc is the best way to progress, making the Shared Watch Event more of a PvE mode as Embark warns that no Merits can be earned from PvP encounters.

“The Shared Watch is an annual holiday that reminds us of the true enemy, by celebrating those that look out for their fellow Raiders,” the studio said in its patch notes. “Tolerate, team-up, or take out some ARC - it’s all in the spirit of the Shared Watch.”

The Arc Raiders team has also brought back the winter Cold Snap event back as a map condition after its removal last month. Players will also notice the Trailblazer has been hit with a nerf that lowers its damage to large Arc like Leapers and Bastions, while removing its ability to do damage through walls.

These things, along with a list of bug fixes, are the headlines for update 1.15.0, but one of the most important changes actually arrived in a surprise hotfix just moments after the patch went live. In [a post on X/Twitter](https://x.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2021218833264967990?s=20), Embark announced the hotfix should do away with the item dupe glitch that recently wormed its way back into the game. As the studio continues to [tackle reports of cheaters](https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-promises-significant-changes-after-players-report-widespread-issues-with-cheaters), the post also says players who “duplicated excessive amounts of items will be subject to further review and possible penalties.”

“Nothing beats earning your loot the hard way, now get back out there and stack those coins honestly!”

Arc Raiders players had been using the latest version of the dupe glitch to illegitimately hoard items and even make lots of quick cash. It resulted in some awkward situations, as Raiders found themselves coming across [mountains of valuable little ducks](https://www.ign.com/articles/what-the-duck-is-this-arc-raiders-duplication-glitch-has-players-running-into-hoarders-with-hundreds-of-squeaky-bath-toys).

Embark is continuing through [its Escalation roadmap](https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-roadmap-promises-a-new-map-more-arcs-and-even-a-little-love-for-scrappy-by-april-2026), which will see new map conditions, new Arc threats, a new map, a new large Arc, and more added by the end of April. Its next Expedition launches February 25, bringing along [a few changes for players unhappy with the rank reset feature](https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-outlines-expedition-changes-after-players-criticized-steep-reward-requirements) the first time around.

We recently sat down with Embark CEO Patrick Söderlund for [an interview](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-arc-raiders-interview-embark-boss-patrick-sderlund-talks-live-service-plans-banning-cheaters-and-the-secret-sauce-of-pve) to learn more about the post-launch roadmap, punishments for cheaters, hotels in Italy, and how the team plans to encourage PvE players. We also learned about how [the success of Arc Raiders](https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-keeps-on-going-as-it-tops-124-million-copies-sold-gifts-all-players-a-gilded-pickaxe) has [changed the studio for the better](https://www.ign.com/articles/huge-success-of-arc-raiders-gives-embark-financial-security-and-employment-stability-75-million-budget-estimate-not-too-far-off).

## Arc Raiders Update 1.15.0 Patch Notes

Raiders,

What happens topside, stays topside - Raiders have to leave their grudges at the tubes.

But Speranza also has a conscience. While Raider violence can’t be totally controlled, Celeste is keen to remind us why we took refuge under the dust of the Rust Belt; and that just because we live in the dirt, we don’t always have to act like it.

The Shared Watch is an annual holiday that reminds us of the true enemy, by celebrating those that look out for their fellow Raiders. Tolerate, team-up, or take out some ARC - it’s all in the spirit of the Shared Watch.

## What’s New?

-   Shared Watch
    -   This is an opportunity to team up in the fight against the machines.
    -   The Shared Watch Event starts today and ends on February 24. Players will earn merits from destroying, assisting and damaging ARC and earn rewards. No merits will be earned from PvP encounters. Bring a friend or bring a stranger, but above all, bring enough ammo to make sure the machines notice you first.
-   Cold Snap Map Condition
    -   Winter is not quite done with the Rust Belt - We are bringing back Cold Snap!
    -   The map condition is back in rotation on outdoor maps with the same mix of risk and reward. Frostbite damage will make your trip topside a short one if you don’t seek shelter, but for those who do brave the tundra - there’s increased loot value at stake!
    -   You can still collect Candleberries, but they are no longer tied to any event. You can also collect, and throw, snowballs! Use them wisely, or don't.
-   Cosmetics
    -   The Vulpine set
    -   The Slugger set

## Content and Bug Fixes

Some of you have noticed changes in past updates that didn’t make it into the patch notes, thank you for flagging those and keeping us on our toes!

We’ve been building ARC Raiders for years, but we’ve only been live for a short while, and we’re still growing into the rhythm (and discipline) of live operations. Making patch notes that are complete, accurate, and easy to follow is a muscle we’re actively training.

We’re improving our internal process so fewer things slip through, and when something does, your reports help us catch it quickly and update the notes. Please keep letting us know when you spot something missing, it genuinely helps.

### Miscellaneous

-   Improved instances where players sometimes could not reconnect after disconnecting from a game.
-   Fixed an issue where the match start tunnel scene sometimes wasn’t being shown.
-   Fixed an issue where trials’ objective rewards could fail to grant at the end of a round due to a timeout, ensuring partial rewards are awarded when earned.
-   Fixed an issue where the end of round screen would sometimes show incorrect merits, XP, and Live Event points.
-   Fixed an issue where players’ platform icons would sometimes show incorrectly.
-   Fixed an issue where crafting would sometimes get cancelled.

### Utility

-   Trailblazer Grenade
    -   The explosions no longer deal damage through walls.
    -   Deals more damage to small enemies but less damage to bigger enemies such as the Leaper and Bastion.

### Weapons

-   Fixed inconsistent weapon cycling when bound to keys other than the mouse wheel; keybinds now swap weapons reliably.

### Known Issues

-   One of the Marco set helmet variants may appear incorrectly in preview and in the menu but will appear correctly in game.
-   Players may occasionally not receive a skill point as indicated in the result screen. A reboot/playing another round fixes the issue.
-   ‘Purchase Raider Tokens’ page may appear in front of the inbox and profile page when switching between them.
-   Player animations may appear broken when interrupting a search of the Baron Husk.
-   Certain containers may be unavailable to be interacted with.
-   Ziplines placed onto destroyed ARC parts will not appear correctly.
-   Scrappy “Batting Helmet” and the “Slugger” outfit might not appear correctly in the event preview.
-   The “Blindsided” achievement may not trigger as intended on the first attempt.

See you Topside,
