[Magic: The Gathering](https://www.ign.com/games/magic-the-gathering-trading-card-game) has plenty of Universes Beyond on [its contentious 2026 roadmap,](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-full-release-schedule-updated-2026) but [Secrets of Strixhaven](https://zdcs.link/z7Rnk8?object_uuid=8e2578ea-3e1f-4337-a13d-a68ea195bf5d&t=article) is a fan-favorite plane we can’t wait to get back to.

The set, which will feature a [whopping five Commander decks](https://www.ign.com/articles/magics-secrets-of-strixhaven-set-has-five-commander-decks-heres-what-we-know-about-them), is getting a tie-in novel and sees us slinging spells with the students again, but if you’re looking to build an instant collection, you can [grab a Play Booster Box at Amazon at a discount already](https://zdcs.link/Qxe3Rj?object_uuid=8e2578ea-3e1f-4337-a13d-a68ea195bf5d&t=article) - despite the fact it doesn’t launch until late April.

### Secrets of Strixhaven Play Booster Box

## Save Money On Magic’s Secrets of Strixhaven

Amazon is offering a box of 30 Play Boosters for $149.99, reduced from its $164.70 list price. That 9% discount might not sound huge, but Amazon’s preorder price guarantee means if it drops even lower, you’ll pay less.

That makes each pack of 14 cards $4.99, down from $5.49, and if you’re excited about the return to Strixhaven, you’ll no doubt be grateful for it.

It’s also worth noting that, as we get closer to release, we’ll find a lot of the chase cards in terms of gameplay and financial value. Depending on how previews go, demand could pick up and make it harder to grab a box at MSRP, let alone below. You’ll have a better chance of grabbing a pricey card with a Collector Booster, but for actually opening cards with which to play the game, this is a great way to get an instant collection.
