The legendary voice behind God of War's recent iteration of Kratos, Christopher Judge, has teased that we'll likely get more news about the franchise in "late summer."

According to a recording from [streamer and YouTuber Fuzhpuzy](https://www.youtube.com/live/RTJe0WGFuIM?si=JxETT6IkW-57CgKR&t=6249) at Canada's Fan Expo, Judge, who may not have known he was being recorded at the time, confirmed that while he would not be "playing in the remake" — that role is for Kratos' original voice actor, TC Carson — "you'll be hearing about what we're doing probably late summer."

The suggestion here is that Judge is back working with Sony Santa Monica on a separate God of War project unrelated to the studio's early work beginning to remake the franchise's original trilogy (and the new side-scrolling spin-off Sons of Sparta, which was largely made elsewhere).

Interestingly, Judge also explained that the [recently announcement remake](https://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-trilogy-remake) starring TC Carson will boast "all the new technology in it, add more stuff, a new fighting system."

It's our biggest clue yet that an all-new Sony Santa Monica God of War game is on the way. It's been pretty quiet ever since 2022's [God of War: Ragnarök](https://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok) in which Kratos and Atreus set out on a mythic journey for answers before Ragnarök arrives, visiting each of the Nine Realms in the brutal and epic sequel.

There had been a live-service multiplayer game in the works, but at the beginning of 2025, [Sony canceled two unannounced live-service projects that had been in development at Bend Studio and Bluepoint Games](https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games), with the latter thought to be a multiplayer God of War game. Then, towards the end of the year, [details and images of the canceled game leaked online](https://www.ign.com/articles/leaked-screenshots-of-canceled-multiplayer-god-of-war-game-tease-a-return-to-greece-and-an-infamous-former-villain), confirming the rumors had been true.

As for Amazon's upcoming adaptation of Sony Santa Monica's [God of War series](https://www.ign.com/tv/god-of-war-the-series)? The live-action Prime Video TV series based on the popular ancient mythology-themed video game is picking up speed. [Ryan Hurst will play Kratos](https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-show-finds-its-kratos-in-ragnarok-alum-ryan-hurst), [Callum Vinson will play Kratos’ son, Atreus](https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-show-finds-its-atreus-in-callum-vinson), and [Teresa Palmer](https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-tv-show-adds-teresa-palmer-as-sif-as-casting-ramps-up), [Max Parker](https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-grows-as-max-parker-signs-on-to-play-heimdall-in-live-action-show), [Ólafur Darri Ólafsson](https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-show-picks-severances-olafur-darri-olafsson-to-play-thor), [Alastair Duncan](https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-show-brings-back-alastair-duncan-to-play-mimir-as-actors-for-brok-and-sindri-join-the-cast), and [Mandy Patinkin](https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-show-finds-its-live-action-odin-in-the-princess-brides-mandy-patinkin) join as Sif, Heimdall, Thor, Mimir, and Odin, respectively.
