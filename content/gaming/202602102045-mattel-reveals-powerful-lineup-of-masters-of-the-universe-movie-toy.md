Before it was a multimedia empire, Masters of the Universe started life as an action figure line. It only makes sense that Mattel would be going all-out on new MotU toys as He-Man and his friends return to the big screen in 2026.

IGN can exclusively reveal new images of the new Masters of the Universe figures and role-playing toys ahead of their debut at New York Toy Fair 2026 this weekend. Get a closer look in the slideshow gallery below:

This new line of action figures is designed at a 5.5-inch scale, making them a smaller and more kid-friendly alternative to Mattel's collector-oriented Masters of the Universe figures. This initial "Masters of the Universe Core Kids Assortment" line will include He-Man, Skeletor, Teela, Beast-Man, and Skel-Knight figures. Each figure includes 14 points of articulation and is priced at $10.79

He-Man and Skeletor are also being featured in the "Masters of the Universe Kids Feature Assortment" line. Power Sword Slash He-Man and Havoc Staff Attack Skeletor are priced at $16.19.

Finally, there's the "Masters of the Universe Core Assortment" line, which focuses on accessory vehicles and role-playing toys. There's the Battle Cat Feature Action Figure ($21.59), the Roton Assault Vehicle ($37.79), the Skeletor Talking Mask Role Play toy ($21.59), and the obligatory Power Sword replica ($43.19).

All of these toys will be released in Spring 2026, with the official global retail launch date for the Master of the Universe movie line being April 25.

Masters of the Universe stars Nicholas Galitzine as He-Man and Jared Leto as Skeletor and is set to hit theaters on June 5, 2026.
