### LEGO Super Mario World: Mario & Yoshi #71438

This set looks like a fantastic build for Mario fans to work on. The 1,215 bricks in the box come together to create a pixelated Mario and Yoshi plucked straight out of the side-scrolling Super Mario World. It even comes with a handle at the base that, when turned, makes Yoshi appear to run, and a dial behind Yoshi’s head makes his tongue pop in and out, too.

IGN's Chris Reed very much enjoyed piecing this one together. In his [We Build](https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-lego-super-mario-world-mario-yoshi) of the set, he said it "gave me a strong dose of nostalgia as I pieced it together over several evenings. It's my favorite Nintendo LEGO set to date, and it looks so good on my desk that I’m going to leave it there for the foreseeable future. I can’t get enough of this thing."

If it's been on your radar, now is an excellent time to grab this set while it's back to its lowest price so far at Amazon.
