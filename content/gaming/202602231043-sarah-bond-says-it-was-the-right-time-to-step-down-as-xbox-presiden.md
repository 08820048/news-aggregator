Former Xbox president Sarah Bond called her [recent departure](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-phil-spencer-and-samantha-bond-leaving-xbox) "the right time for me to take my next step, both personally and professionally."

In a statement shared on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sarahrbond_sharing-with-gratitude-the-note-i-sent-to-activity-7430753683912531968-YEXj/), Bond said she would remain at Xbox as an advisor during the transition "to help ensure a smooth transition and set the organisation up for continued success."

"We're living through a transformative technological era that will shape the next generation of our industry, and I'm energised by what's ahead," Bond wrote. "This moment also presents a unique opportunity for fresh eyes and new leadership to guide the team into its next chapter."

Bond said she met with Asha Sharma, who will replace Phil Spencer as Microsoft Gaming CEO following his retirement.

"I've had the privilege of spending time with Asha over the last few weeks as we've planned for this transition, and I've seen firsthand her deep commitment to our players, developers, and brand," Bond continued.

"She brings deep technology and commerce experience, along with a strong track record of building and scaling platforms that the world uses. Xbox deserves this. I'm excited to see her lead this next chapter for our team."

Sharma joined Microsoft in 2024 as president of CoreAI. As part of the leadership transition, Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty was promoted to chief content officer.

Bond also shared her gratitude to Spencer, who joined Microsoft in 1988 in software management before moving to Xbox following its launch in 2001.

"I want to thank Phil for his mentorship and friendship over the years. He's been a consistent champion of this business and the people who make it what it is, and I've learned a great deal from the way he leads through both opportunity and challenge. I'm grateful for his trust and support throughout my time on the team."

Bond joined Xbox in 2017 as VP of partnerships and [was promoted to president in 2023](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sarah-bond-promoted-to-xbox-president-amid-leadership-changes).
