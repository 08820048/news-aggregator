You'll be able to check out one of last year's best strategy sims for free this weekend. Ubisoft's [_Anno 117: Pax Romana_](https://www.polygon.com/anno-117-pax-romana-preview/) will be free-to-play for a limited time from Feb. 26 through March 2.

_Anno 117: Pax Romana_ is a strategic city-builder set during the Pax Romana period of Ancient Rome, one considered a golden age of peace and expansion. You'll assume the role of a Roman governor, ruling over Latium or the Celtic lands of Albion. You'll build up your land's economy and dictate its culture, like what deities its people can worship. _Anno 117: Pax Romana_ reviewed well, with an average [83 score on OpenCritic](https://opencritic.com/game/19134/anno-117-pax-romana), with [Polygon's review](https://www.polygon.com/anno-117-pax-romana-review/) saying it "makes one spectacular city-building game. Without menu clutter, Ubisoft’s latest is relaxing and strategically challenging at the same time." It did catch some heat, however, for its [use of generative AI artwork](https://aftermath.site/this-is-where-my-anno-117-impressions-were-going-to-go/).

Future DLC was also teased via a gossip-filled live-action trailer. Expect a new island, deity, military units, and more to come to _Anno 117_ with its [Year 1 pass](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3749050/Anno_117_Pax_Romana__Year_1_Pass/). The first DLC pack is expected to drop April 2026.

The free-to-play period starts Thursday, Feb. 26, and ends Monday, March 2. If you've linked your Ubisoft and Twitch accounts, you can snag some Twitch drops — a Callinectes Logo and a Venusian Shell Logo —by watching _Anno 117: Pax Romana_ streams. They'll be given away until Thursday, March 12.
