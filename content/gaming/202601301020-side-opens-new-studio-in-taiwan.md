Gaming services provider Side has opened a new studio in Taiwan.

Located in the Nangang District of Taipei, the expansion has been described as a "strategic move" by the company and has created 79 jobs.

Side has been operating in Taiwan for eight years, and reported strong performance in its quality assurance, localisation, and localisation QA businesses in 2025. This resulted in the Side Taipei team completing over 100 projects and promoting 10% of its full-time staff.

The new studio's focus will remain on these divisions, but it will also work closely with other studios in Side's network to "support cross functional projects."

"We are seeing the global gaming industry in flux right now, but the Asian market is continuing to grow across console, PC, and mobile gaming," said Side Taipei head Frank Chang.

"We built Side Taipei at an East-meets-West crossroads; people in Taiwan are deeply immersed in East Asian and American cultural content. That cultural fluency, combined with our strengths in QA, localisation, and LQA, means we're built to deliver for partners across \[platforms\]."

Side CEO Deborah Kirkham added: "Our opening in Taipei today is not just another studio opening, it's a commitment to Taiwan's gaming industry and the innovative team we have here.

"Side has always been at the forefront of change, and our Taipei team is no different – the focus for 2026 will be on doubling down on our award-winning talent and leveraging our AI solutions for the betterment of our clients."
