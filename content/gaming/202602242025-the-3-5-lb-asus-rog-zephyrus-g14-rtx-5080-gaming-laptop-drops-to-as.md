Open Box "Excellent Condition"

### Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 14" 3K OLED AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 RTX 5080 Gaming Laptop (32GB/2TB)

The latest Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 gaming laptop is definitely one of the thinnest and lightest gaming laptops, measuring 0.63" thick and weighing in at under 3.5 pounds. It features a gorgeous 14" 3K 120Hz ROG Nebula OLED display, AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370, GeForce RTX 5070 Ti GPU, 32GB of LPDDR5X RAM, and 2TB NVEMe SSD. The entire shell is made of CNC-milled aluminum construction keeps the weight down and features premium accents like a huge glass touchpad.

The G14 is for anyone who wants a thin and light laptop that can be brought anywhere as a daily driver, but still with the power to play games. The RTX 5080 discrete graphics is capable of playing just about any game on the display's upgraded 2880x1800 resolution, especially if the game supports DLSS 4.5 (which most new games do nowadays). The RTX 5080 is power limited to a 120W TGP (standard for the 5080 mobile is 150W), but performance is still excellent. This is about as powerful of a GPU you can get while maintaining a slim footprint. Most RTX 5080/5090 gaming laptops are huge.
