People will tell you two things about John Wick. One, Keanu Reeves kicks ass in it. Two, it's basically a video game in movie form. Somehow, though, it's taken over a decade for us to get a proper _John Wick_ game. And based on what Sony showed off [during today's impressive State of Play](https://www.polygon.com/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-playstation/), perhaps it was worth the wait.

The game doesn't officially have a name yet — it's currently referred to as _Untitled John Wick Game_. The trailer begins with CGI introducing John Wick and his elegant assassin for hire deal. The last segment of the trailer ends with a look at what the action game will look like in motion. It lasts all of a few seconds, but the gameplay is looking promising thus far. We see John Wick get up close and personal with his enemies as he hits, slams, and breaks anyone who stands in his way.

The game is a joint venture between Saber, Lionsgate, and franchise director Chad Stahelski. It'll have an original script and will take place in the actual John Wick universe.

"Saber’s design will be faithful to the unique style and signature elements of the series, including a distinct gun fu combat system, jaw-dropping camerawork, immersive driving experiences, and a variety of memorable environments, all crafted to make players feel like they are in a John Wick movie, playing the role of John Wick himself," reads the game's official description.

Technically, this isn't the first John Wick video game — that would be the 2019 tactical RPG _John Wick Hex_. John Wick has also appeared in games like _Fortnite_ and has been a major inspiration for some modern action games. But UJWG is the first real game that appears to try to replicate what makes the movies so good, made by the same people who filmed the series.
