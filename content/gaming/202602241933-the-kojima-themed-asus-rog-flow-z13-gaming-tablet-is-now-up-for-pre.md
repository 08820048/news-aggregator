Ludens, for those unaware, is the futuristic astronaut mascot of Kojima Productions. The tablet’s shell is black and gold, designed to look like Ludens’ suit. It also comes with a white carrying case with a similarly futuristic design. The case says “For Ludens who dare” and “Extra-vehicular creative activity device” on its side. It also includes a detachable keyboard that’s decked out in the same style and color scheme, as well as a 200W adapter adorned with the Ludens skull.

As for the tablet itself, it’s a fantastic piece of gaming tech. In our [review](https://www.ign.com/articles/asus-rog-flow-z13-2025-gaming-tablet-laptop-review) of the non-Kojima edition, veteran tech reviewer Chris Coke gave it a 9/10, calling it, “the gaming tablet evolved.” It’s a 2.75lb tablet with a 13.4” display that packs a 16-core AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 processor, up to 50 TOPS NPU power, and RDNA 3.5 graphics. You can find the full specs on the [product listing page](https://zdcs.link/9gXOoq?object_uuid=4adb0397-7512-40bb-ad93-3d66475115bb&t=article).

Our review sums it up like this: “The Asus ROG Flow Z13 is a fantastic 2-in-1 laptop-tablet for a particular kind of user, those who want that versatility with the best performance possible for productivity and gaming in this form factor – talk about multifaceted. It’s an exciting glimpse at what laptops may offer in the future, too. If this form factor isn’t important to you, you'll be better served looking into full-on laptops with a dedicated GPU for gaming and are likely to spend less in the process. If you're willing to trade a higher cost for portability and versatility, however, it's an impressive achievement that sets a new standard for integrated graphics.”
