As part of its Year 11 roadmap, _[Rainbow Six Siege](https://www.polygon.com/game/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/37447/)_ is getting a Metal Gear Solid-themed update. The upcoming Season One: Operation Silent Hunt, will add Solid Snake to the multiplayer shooter as a permanent Operator, and voice actor David Hayter is reprising his iconic role for the occasion.

Ubisoft shared the news at its Rainbow Six Invitational event over the weekend. It lifted the lid on Rainbow Six Siege's Year 11 roadmap, which will begin on March 3 with Operation Silent Hunt. The shooter will receive major balancing updates, anti-cheat improvements, and more across four seasons of content. Metal Gear Solid will be the focus of that first update, which will bring a new mode and skins to the game.

The big news is that Solid Snake is going to be a playable character in _Rainbow Six Siege_, but Hayter's return to the role is just as significant for Metal Gear Solid fans. Hayter began voicing the character in 1998's _Metal Gear Solid_, and continued voicing versions of Snake through 2010's _Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker_ (which you'll soon be able to play again as part of [_Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Volume 2_](https://www.polygon.com/metal-gear-solid-4-is-finally-getting-freed/)). His streak [famously ended](https://www.polygon.com/2016/3/26/11309190/david-hayter-solid-snake-metal-gear-solid-3-5-snake-eater-phantom-pain/) in 2014's _Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes_ and 2015's [_Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain_](https://www.polygon.com/2013/9/24/4768178/metal-gear-solid-5-ground-zeroes-intro-kiefer-sutherland-snake/), as Kiefer Sutherland was tapped to voice both games' versions of Snake.

Hayter has only reprised his role sporadically in the decade since that game. He voiced both Solid Snake and Naked Snake in _Super Bomberman R_, and some of his old voice lines were reused in both [_Super Smash Bros. Ultimate_](https://www.polygon.com/e3/2018/6/12/17454264/super-smash-bros-brawl-david-hayter-solid-snake/) and last year's [_Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater_](https://www.polygon.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review-mgs3-remake/). Konami tapped Hayter to re-record a few lines in the latter, but his return for _Rainbow Six Siege_ will see him performing entirely new voice cues for the shooter.

The update will also add a Metal Gear Solid-themed 4v4 Infiltration mode to the game. The limited-time event will have Snake and Zero leading teams of Operators to recover stolen data. Elsewhere, the 6v6 Dual Front mode is getting a new mission called Last Assignment, which was designed as a nod to the series, Ubisoft says. The shooter will also get some Metal Gear Solid skins, including ones that dress Jackal up as Gray Fox and Ash up as Meryl.

Later seasons will bring a Ranked 3.0 update, the new map Calypso Casino, mouse and keyboard support on consoles, and more.

_Rainboiw Six Siege_ Season One: Operation Silent Hunt kicks off Year 11 on March 3.
