Ubisoft Toronto has reduced its workforce by 40 roles as part of [Ubisoft's global cost-saving initiative](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-reveals-new-creative-house-structure-cancels-games-and-announces-final-round-of-cost-cutting-and-studio-closures-to-drive-200m-savings).

Development on the Splinter Cell remake will continue, as will co-development projects including contributions to Rainbow Six.

"This decision was not taken lightly and does not in any way reflect the talent, dedication, or contributions of the individuals affected," Ubisoft said in a statement provided to _GamesIndustry.biz_.

"Our priority now is to support them through this transition with comprehensive severance packages and robust career placement assistance."

The layoffs were first reported by Canadian outlet [MobileSyrup](https://mobilesyrup.com/2026/02/19/ubisoft-toronto-layoffs-splinter-cell-remake-development/), which shared an internal email stating that Ubisoft Toronto will remain "a key contributor to several co-development mandates and service teams."

Ubisoft Toronto is the latest studio impacted by the organisation's restructuring program announced last month.

As part of its final round of cost-cutting measures, Ubisoft closed several studios, including Ubisoft Stockholm and [Ubisoft Halifax](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-shuttering-freshly-unionised-halifax-studio-71-jobs-affected). The company also cancelled the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake and three new IPs.

A week later, the company initiated [a voluntary redundancy program at Ubisoft International in Paris](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-redundancy-process-to-cut-200-jobs-from-paris-head-office), proposing to reduce its workforce by 200 roles.
