The third edition of Gamescom dev's executive summit will return in February in Lisbon, Portugal.

"Exclusive to C-level, founders, and senior decision-makers," the event, running February 24-26, will host six roundtables across three days on topics such as studio resilience, future business models, and how to "tackle AI disruption."

The organizers say that unlike traditional conferences, this summit is designed to foster confidential, high-level exchange, "allowing senior leaders to speak candidly and collaborate with peers on shared challenges." Furthermore, the agenda is shaped by the attendees themselves.

"In the midst of one of the most complex transformation periods in the global games industry, the gamescom dev leadership summit 2026 powered by Xsolla offers a rare opportunity for C-suite leaders to step back, reflect, and set their strategic direction for the year ahead," the organization said in a press statement.

"This event has grown into a trusted space for strategic reflection and candid exchange," said Lars Janssen, host of the gamescom dev leadership summit and CEO at Deck13. "It's about stepping away from daily operations and thinking critically about where we’re going as an industry."
