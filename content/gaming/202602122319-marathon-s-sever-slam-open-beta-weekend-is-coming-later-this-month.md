Bungie announced yet another [_Marathon_](https://www.polygon.com/game/marathon/557475/) test during the February 2026 PlayStation State of Play. But this time, it's one everybody can take part in. The _Marathon_ "Server Slam" weekend (read: open beta weekend) runs from Feb. 26 through March 2 on PlayStation 5 and "other platforms" ahead of the game's March 5 launch. Turns out the last weeks 'til launch are more of a sprint, huh.

Anyway, the _Marathon_ beta will include:

-   Infiltrate into two zones:
    -   Perimeter
    -   Dire Marsh
-   Take on the opening contracts for five of _Marathon_’s factions
-   Try out all six Runner Shells, plus Rook in scavenger mode
-   Solo queue, proximity chat, "and more"

Bungie announced the beta alongside a new trailer showcasing _Marathon_'s setting.

It's been a rough old time for _Marathon_. Bungie intended to launch it in back September 2025, before [delaying it indefinitely](https://www.polygon.com/news/607525/bungie-delays-marathon-release-date/) after negative feedback from an alpha test. "Indefinite" turned out to be "[not that long, actually](https://www.polygon.com/marathon-release-date/)," as Bungie started the new year with another release date announcement, which has (so far) stuck. Feedback from [another closed test in October 2025](https://www.polygon.com/bungie-marathon-technical-test-playtest-how-to-enter/), part of a series of tests Bungie ran to figure out how to fix _Marathon_'s issues, was positive and things look like they're running smoothly in the lead-up to its March launch.

However, _Marathon_'s social clout still hasn't quite recovered from the many blows it's received since Bungie's initial reveal. First, there were [repeated comparisons to Firewalk's ill-fated _Concord_](https://www.polygon.com/news/562415/concord-developer-on-bungie-marathon/), which might seem like nothing, except [a lot of multiplayer games tarred with that brush](https://www.polygon.com/free-to-play-model-highguard-2xko-layoffs/) met [a similar fate](https://www.polygon.com/highguard-developer-wildlight-entertainment-layoffs/). Then there were the [accusations of plagiarism](https://www.polygon.com/gaming/599536/bungie-marathon-stolen-artwork/), as an artist said Bungie took material they created for a promotional poster and included it without change in _Marathon_. It wasn't the first time Bungie faced such accusations and admitted wrongdoing. Then Bungie [accidentally forced _Destiny 2_](https://www.polygon.com/marathon-preorders-destiny-2-downloads/) onto anyone who pre-ordered _Marathon_ on Steam (whoops).

Bungie will release _Marathon_ on March 5 for PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X.
