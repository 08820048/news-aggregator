It's that time of year: filing your tax return. It's a good day for people who overpay their taxes throughout the year and receive a nice fat check in return. It's not so good of a day for people who have claimed too many exemptions. Whatever the case, most Americans will need to file a tax return no later than April 15 and that's just two months away.

## File Your Federal and State Tax Returns for Free

TurboTax is offering a great incentive where you can file both your federal and state returns for $0, guaranteed, with no hidden fees through Turbotax's DIY mobile app. There are a list of requisites to be eligible:

-   You didn't file with TurboTax last year (or didn't file at all)
-   You must file your tax return no later than February 28
-   You must file through TurboTax's DIY mobile app
-   This only applies to Do it Yourself, not TurboTax's Expert products

The best part about this deal - besides the fact that it's free - is that it works for any tax situation, for example even if you have to report cryptocurrency or stocks (Schedule D), freelance business income (Schedule C), or rental income (Schedule E). That makes it even better than TurboTax's Free Edition software, which only works for customers with simple Form 1040 tax situations. The mobile app also supports automated data entry; you can snap a photo of your W-2 and TurboTax will import the data from over 1 million employers automatically. Give it a try, since it won't cost you anything.
