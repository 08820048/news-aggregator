Each FED Fitness DB1 dumbbell is adjustable from 5 pounds all the way up to 52.5 pounds. The adjustment mechanism works similarly to the Bowflex SelectTech series; you turn a dial in 2.5 or 5 pound increments, which locks in a specific combination of plates that add up to the desired weight. Unlike traditional free weights that take up a decent chunk of space, these adjustable dumbbells are neatly contained in a compact package that measures just 16" square.

The build quality and materials is what you'd expect from a good, solid pair of dumbbells. Nearly the entire dumbbell is made of a tough steel alloy. The handle is rubber coated to eliminate slippage. The plates are hexagonal shaped so they won't roll around when you put them down. The adjustment dial and locking mechanisms have loud clicks for easy feedback. FED Fitness backs these dumbbells up with a 30-day money back return policy and a 3 year warranty.

Free weights are a great choice for anyone who wants to work out at home but is limited on space. A pair of dumbbells is all the equipment you need to get access to a wide range of exercises that can target just about every muscle in your upper and lower body. Supplement your free weight exercises with cardio and other workouts that use your own body weight as resistance (like pushups, burpees, or squats) and you may never need to purchase more equipment.
