Now Xbox has a new boss, what happens next? In a new interview, Asha Sharma, a Microsoft executive who previously oversaw some of the firm's AI initiatives, kept things frustratingly vague, but did indicate that nothing is off the table when it comes to big decisions about recent controversial policies.

Last week, Microsoft sent shockwaves throughout the video game industry when [it confirmed Phil Spencer and Sarah Bond were leaving Xbox](https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-retiring-sarah-bond-out-matt-booty-promoted-as-microsoft-ai-exec-asha-sharma-named-new-xbox-boss-exclusive), with Sharma in place as new CEO of its gaming business. Fans are split, with some choosing to believe in the promised "return to Xbox," others expressing concern about the future of Microsoft's gaming business. [Even the ‘father of Xbox’ is worried about what happens next](https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-is-being-sunsetted-seamus-blackley-one-of-the-creators-of-xbox-thinks-recent-shakeup-spells-the-end-for-microsofts-gaming-business).

One of the big questions fans have for Sharma is whether Microsoft will reverse some of its recent policies, many of which have alienated the core Xbox fanbase. Fans have criticized Microsoft for leaving Xbox game exclusivity behind in favor of a multiplatform approach that has seen the company’s biggest brands — [including Halo](https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-is-the-final-nail-in-the-coffin-for-the-xbox-exclusive-but-in-truth-the-ps5-version-comes-as-no-surprise) — make the jump to PlayStation. Why buy an Xbox now, when all Xbox games come out on everything?

In a new interview with [Windows Central](https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-talking-to-new-xbox-ceo-asha-sharma-and-cco-matt-booty), Sharma avoided specifics when asked about the future and recent strategic decisions, only offering the cryptic "the plan's the plan until it's not the plan."

Here’s the quote in full:

"Right now, I need to learn, candidly. About the 'why' of these decisions, what we were optimizing for, and what the data says about the Xbox strategy today. That's the honest answer. I'm looking at lifetime value, not just what happened in a previous moment, or in short term efficiencies and things like that. The plan's the plan until it's not the plan."

What does that mean? It’s hard to tell. It feels like a holding statement, the kind of thing you might say when you don’t want to commit to anything either way. But it’s hard to see Microsoft all of a sudden pulling out of multiplatform game releases, especially when its studios have put so much effort into making Microsoft's policy a reality, and in some cases seen great success on the likes of PlayStation. Halo is coming to PlayStation this year, and that’s unlikely to change.

Will things change further down the line? Could Microsoft start releasing exclusives again, particularly in the context of the upcoming next Xbox? All eyes are now on Asha Sharma to find out. [A 2027 launch for the next Xbox was recently described as the best case scenario](https://www.ign.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-2027-launch-reportedly-best-case-scenario-following-amd-hint-that-microsoft-may-ship-new-hardware-next-year). There isn't a great deal of time to sort everything out before the next crucial juncture in Xbox history.

In the shorter term, [Sharma has been responding to further scrutiny of her Xbox play history](https://www.ign.com/articles/faking-would-be-a-terrible-idea-and-wouldnt-work-new-microsoft-gaming-boss-asha-sharma-says-dont-read-too-much-into-her-xbox-play-history), explaining that her account had been shared among others at home.

IGN has much more on Sharma's arrival and the departure of Spencer, including the many [farewells to him from veteran developers](https://www.ign.com/articles/industry-vets-react-to-xbox-leaders-phil-spencer-and-sarah-bond-departing-bond-gives-her-statement), [Spencer's personal words to the Xbox community following his departure](https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-reflects-on-38-years-at-microsoft-i-never-could-have-imagined-the-path-ahead), and [Sharma's own responses to initial concerns around her recent AI work and lack of gaming industry job experience](https://www.ign.com/articles/no-tolerance-for-bad-ai-new-xbox-boss-responds-to-concerns-around-her-microsoft-background).
