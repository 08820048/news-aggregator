With the Visitor's entrance in [_Fortnite_](https://www.polygon.com/game/fortnite/2417/) Chapter 7 Season 1, players are now able to complete the **"Interference" and "Redacted" story quests**.

​​

There are seven stages to complete in total, and it all begins by talking to The Visitor in Classified Canyon. You'll be taken across the map as you must use stealth splashes, eliminate opponents at Lethal Labs or Classified Canyon, touch a zero point shard, and more.

Here's **how to complete every stage of the Interference and Redacted story quests** along with all of their rewards.

**Update (Feb. 26):** Every stage of the Interference and Redacted story quests have been released, so we've updated this guide to reflect that.

## Ask The Visitor about investigating Dark Voyager

For Stage 1, you need to interact with The Visitor who can be found just south of the Classified Canyon triangle. After you find and talk to them, make sure to complete the stage by selecting the story dialogue option, "Dark Voyager."

Once complete, you'll earn 15,000 XP and unlock the next stage.

## Travel distance while under the effect of stealth splash to outmaneuver Dark Voyager

For Stage 2, you need to find stealth splash, a throwable item that will make any player "invisible," but affected players will still have a faint outline.

Unfortunately, stealth splashes are found just like most other items in _Fortnite_ — as random loot found in chests or on the floor. Once you find one, make sure to throw it at your feet to become stealthed and travel 50 distance. You can sprint, drive a car, or even ride a hot air balloon as they'll all count.Once complete, you'll earn 15,000 XP and unlock the next stage.

## Eliminate opponents at Lethal Labs or Classified Canyon to stall Dark Voyager's work

For Stage 3, you need to eliminate three opponents at either Lethal Labs or Classified Canyon. It doesn't all have to be in the same game or at the same location, so feel free to take your time with this one.

Once complete, you'll earn 15,000 XP and unlock the next stage.

## Touch a Zero Point Shard to investigate its mysterious effects

For Stage 4, head over to the center of Lethal Labs to find the Zero Point Shards, which are the large pieces of floating debris. Now, as the Zero Point Shards are floating, they're a bit out of reach of your jumps. There are a few ways to touch the Zero Point Shard. The easiest way is to glide into it after you drop from the Battle Bus. Other methods include launching yourself with a shockwave grenade, flying in with a wingsuit, or gliding off of a launch pad.

Once complete, you'll earn 15,000 XP, and unlock the next stage.

## Get headshots with the MK-Seven assault rifle

For Stage 5, you'll need to get five headshots with the MK-Seven assault rifle. Unfortunately, like the stealth splash, the MK-Seven doesn't have a set spawn, so you'll need to find it either in chests or as floor loot.

Once complete, you'll earn 15,000 XP and unlock the next stage.

For Stage 6, you'll need to return to Lethal Labs and get airborne again, but, this time, you'll need to aim for Dark Voyager's ship instead of the Zero Point Shards.

Reaching the ship is a bit harder as it's even higher in the sky, so a simple shockwave grenade won't be enough this time around. However, the easiest way to reach the ship is the same as the last — gliding into it after you drop from the Battle Bus. Other methods include using a rift from the rift anomaly, flying in with a wingsuit, or gliding off of a launch pad.

Once complete, you'll earn 15,000 XP and unlock the next stage.

For Stage 7, stick around Lethal Labs as the Dark Voyager's holotable is located just underground. Drop into the hole below the Zero Point Shard and look to the west to see two doors. Enter either one and head to the center of the room to find the holotable along the wall.

Interact with it to finish all seven stages of the story quest.
