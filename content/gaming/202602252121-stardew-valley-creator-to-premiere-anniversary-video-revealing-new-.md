In a post on Twitter/X, ConcernedApe shared the following message: "I made a video for tomorrow's 10-year Stardew Valley Anniversary, it will 'premiere' tomorrow at 11am PST. In the video, I comment on some pre-release footage, and reveal the 2 new 1.7 marriage candidates at the end. See you in the chat." He included [a link to YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geiTg6Z7w3A), where the video will appear tomorrow.

Tomorrow is indeed the 10th anniversary of Stardew Valley, which we celebrated earlier this month with an interview with ConcernedApe himself, during which he revealed that [two new marriage candidates were coming with the planned 1.7 update](https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valleys-17-update-will-add-2-new-marriage-candidates). This is significant news for Stardew fans. There have been no new romantic relationships added to the game since its early days, and fans have [long hoped for the opportunity to marry other villagers](https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-fans-really-hope-theyll-be-able-to-marry-sandy-the-wizard-and-the-hat-mouse-in-17-update) such as Robin, Sandy, the Wizard, or Marlon. We do not know at this time whether these will be existing characters with new dialogue and relationships, or if two new characters are being added, though fans suspect the former.

We also spoke to ConcernedApe earlier this month on a number of other celebratory topics, such as [why there isn't a Stardew Valley TV show](https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-uses-harry-potter-to-explain-why-there-isnt-a-stardew-valley-tv-show), and the [one secret left that the Stardew Valley community has yet to find](https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-still-has-1-secret-players-have-never-found-creator-concernedape-confirms).
