'You can now leave your clothes at home'

## The clothing-optional Pokémon hotel probably isn't what you're expecting

Earlier this year, the Japanese hotel chain [Mimaru announced the renovation and expansion](https://www.thepopverse.com/gaming-pokemon-rooms-hotel-japan-new-more-2026) of its [Pokémon Rooms](https://mimaruhotels.com/en/news/stay-pokemonroom/). They're apartment-like hotel rooms decorated with an abundance of Pokémon on walls, ceilings, furniture, and more. Comforters, plates, and mugs are Poké Ball-themed, while a giant plushie Snorlax greets guests on the bed.

On Wednesday, Mimaru unveiled a partnership with [Any Wear, Anywhere](https://anywear-anywhere.com/) so "you can now leave your clothes at home" when you stay at a Pokémon Room. Wait — not like that!

According to a press release, Any Wear, Anywhere is "a clothing-sharing platform." For those staying at the Pokémon Rooms, it'll "let international guests rent everyday outfits delivered directly to their hotel."

So, yeah. Not _like that_, you [Pokémon perv](https://www.polygon.com/dropout-pokemon-sex-rankings/).

Any Wear, Anywhere allows guests to forgo the stress of packing (and eliminate the possibility of a lost suitcase full of your clothes) to instead rent out clothes during their travels. "We rent everyday outfits you'll actually want to wear in Japan — so you can travel light, move freely, and fill your journey with more of what truly matters," the Any Wear, Anywhere website states. (Bold of them to assume I wouldn't actually want to wear my [Pokémon onesie](https://kigurumi-shop.com/pokemon/?srsltid=AfmBOoqzCzo96i9OVcYSn_DzbwCXFmtiIaWrrk6ZnyfLfmkYxJWHUknv) in Japan.) Any Wear, Anywhere's rental program might be best for those who don't own winter gear and are traveling in the cold months, or for those who just want to maximize their suitcase space for all the sweet, sweet merch they're gonna pick up in Japan.

The clothing rental program is on a trial through next month, and reservations for the Pokémon Rooms are open through November. There are 10 Mimaru locations across Kyoto, Osaka, and Tokyo that offer the Pokémon Rooms.
