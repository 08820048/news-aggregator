**_Battlefield 6_ Season 2** starts this week, bringing fresh new battles to the field. It's the second major update for EA's revival of the war shooter, and will introduce a bunch of features across the base game and [_Battlefield Redsec_](https://www.polygon.com/battlefield-redsec/), its battle royale component. Season 2 will come in three parts: Extreme Measures, Nightfall, and Hunter/Prey. The first of the trio is launching on Tuesday, Feb. 17, but as it's being released globally, it's a little unclear what time it'll be available in your time zone.

Here's **when [_Battlefield 6_](https://www.polygon.com/battlefield-6/) Season 2 releases in your time zone**, plus a little bit about what to expect.

As with the first season of _Battlefield 6_, Season 2 will be broken into multiple smaller phases: **Extreme Measures** starts Feb. 17, **Nightfall** begins March 17, and **Hunter/Prey** begins April 17. At launch, during the Extreme Measures phase of Season 2, here are the biggest additions to _Battlefield 6_:

-   **Three new weapons**: the GRT-GPS DMR, the VRC-2 assault rifle, and the M121 A2 machine gun. (Later in the season a new SMG and sidearm will become available.)
-   **Two new gadgets:** the HTI-MK2 disruption tool for the Recon class, and the 9K38 IGLA anti-air launcher for Engineers.
-   **One new map:** Contaminated is a mountainous Europe-based map that EA said "is between Eastwood and Mirak Valley in terms of size."
-   **One limited-time mode:** VL-7 Strike, which covers maps with toxic gas that causes "disorienting effects" for those who don't stock up on and equip filtered gas masks.
-   **One new vehicle:** The Scout Helicopter returns. [We are so back](https://www.polygon.com/battlefield-6-season-2-roadmap-little-bird/).
