_Mewgenics_, the new release from Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel, the indie devs behind hit roguelike _The Binding of Isaac_ and all its subsequent expansions, smashed through 250,000 copies sold in just 12 hours.

In a tweet posted by Glaiel, he screenshotted a post from 2023 where he explained it would need to sell that much for him to "consider _Mewgenics_ a success." Shortly before, [IGN reported](https://x.com/TylerGlaiel/status/2021385303676915756) the game sold over 150,000 copies in six hours, and that McMillen's previous sales record came with _The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth_, at 40,000 in one day.

This came just a few hours after he revealed the team "made back their development budget after three hours," which given the game was first announced in 2012, is a huge accomplishment. That's a whopping 14 years, although it was put on hold in 2014, canceled in 2016, then picked back up again two years later.

To celebrate, Glaiel posted a picture of both him and McMillen with a cat-shaped cake, while they each hold replica awards and wear gold medals. At the time of writing, _Mewgenics_ peaked with a [player count](https://steamdb.info/app/686060/charts/) just a few shy of 66,000 on Steam, and it was the top-selling game on the platform yesterday.

It's also been received to critical acclaim, with a [Metacritic score](https://www.metacritic.com/game/mewgenics/) of 89 from 38 reviews. Polygon's [_Mewgenics_ review](https://www.polygon.com/mewgenics-review-pc/) describes it as "a charmingly churlish game" that "players could likely get years of entertainment from," along with considering it "the [first GOTY contender](https://www.polygon.com/goty-2026-first-mewgenics/)" for 2026.
