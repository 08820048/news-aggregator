---
Sony's latest State of Play showcase on Thursday included a bevy of new trailers, reveals, and more. It was a long one, clocking in at an hour in length, and was chock-full of updates on upcoming PlayStation 5 games like _Beast of Reincarnation_ and _Silent Hill: Townfall_. We also got some surprise reveals, like _God of War: Sons of Sparta_ and an untitled John Wick game. That's right. He's thinkin' he's back.

If you didn't want to set aside an hour to watch the stream (understandable) or need a refresher on what was revealed amidst the flurry of announcements, we have you covered.

## Two God of War projects announced

The God of War returns to Greece. The State of Play closed by announcing the original trilogy of God of War games are being remade. Better yet, that announcement was followed by the reveal of a 2D prequel, [_Sons of Sparta_](https://www.polygon.com/god-of-war-greek-trilogy-remake-son-of-sparta/), that's out today.

## Beast of Reincarnation gets summer release date

Pokémon developer Game Freak’s next project just got a release date. [_Beast in Reincarnation_](https://www.polygon.com/beast-of-reincarnation-release-date/) will be released Aug. 4 for PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. It’s an action adventure game where your player character’s dog companion matters just as much as your character. For more about the game, read [Polygon's interview with its director](https://www.polygon.com/beast-of-reincarnation-game-freak-interview/).

## Kena: Scars of Kosmora revealed

[_Kena: Bridge of Spirits_ is getting a sequel](https://www.polygon.com/kena-scars-of-kosmora-bridge-of-spirits-sequel/) for PlayStation 5 and Windows PC, and it’s arriving this year. _Scars of Kosmora_ finds a more experienced Kena in a new land, and with a giant wolf BFF companion.

Grab some friends to battle demonic versions of the Yōtei Six when the free multiplayer-focused [_Ghost of Yōtei: Legends_ releases March 10](https://www.polygon.com/ghost-of-yotei-legends-dlc-co-op-free-release-date-march/). You'll choose to play as one of four classes. A raid will be released in April.

## First look at Silent Hill: Townfall

[_Silent Hill: Townfall_](https://www.polygon.com/silent-hill-transmission-townfall-announcement-2026/) made an appearance at Sony’s State of Play ahead of Konami’s own stream. It’s a first-person spin-off published by Annapurna Interactive, and looks absolutely horrifying (as expected).

## Death Stranding 2: On the Beach coming to PC next month

2025 Game of the Year-nominee _Death Stranding 2: On the Beach_ is coming to Windows PC, and sooner than expected, given how long PlayStation exclusives typically take to make the leap from consoles to PC. It’ll arrive on March 19.

## Two Legacy of Kain games are on the way

2003’s [_Legacy of Kain: Defiance_ is getting remastered](https://www.polygon.com/legacy-of-kain-defiance-remastered-ascendance/) with upgraded visuals and a modernized camera.

Also arriving this year is _Legacy of Kain: Ascendance_, out March 31 for Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. It’s a prequel to the first _Soul Reaver_ and is a 2D action game with a pixel art visual style.

The [original _Rayman_ game from 1995 is being rereleased](https://www.polygon.com/rayman-30th-anniversary-edition/), and you can play it Friday, Feb. 13. Instead of a remaster or remake, it’s the original game with several bells and whistles, including a 50-minute documentary. _Rayman: 30th Anniversary Edition_ will be available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X.

## Project Windless revealed

_Project Windless_ was formally revealed during the State of Play stream. It’s an upcoming open-world RPG set in the world of Lee Youngdo’s The Bird That Drinks Tears fantasy series. You’ll play as a Rekon, which is a species of yoked chicken people who seem more than capable at cracking a few heads.

## Extended look at 4:Loop

Bad Robot shared an extended look at its Left 4 Dead-like co-op game, 4:Loop. Expect to try it out in a beta some time soon. Portals!

## Pragmata

## Leon lands some hits in new Resident Evil Requiem trailer

_Resident Evil Requiem_ is only a couple of weeks away, as it will be released on Feb. 27 for all major platforms. Today's State of Play trailer showed Leon landing some hits on some zombies, unlike the trailer spot at last week’s Nintendo Direct.

## Brigandine Abyss

The State of Play shared a new teaser for the tactics game _Brigandine Abyss_, promising 100 playable classes and six main storylines when it launches.

## New look at Star Wars: Galactic Racer

_Star Wars: Galactic Racer_ was [just revealed at The Game Awards](https://www.polygon.com/star-wars-galactic-racer-trailer-sebulba-game-awards/) at the end of last year, but that didn’t preclude it from an inclusion at Sony’s State of Play. A new trailer debuted, but the game is still without a release date.

## Dead or Alive turns 30

Koei Tecmo announced _Dead or Alive 6 Last Round_ will be released June 25 as a free-to-play title. It also shared a sneak peak at the next Dead or Alive project, but didn't share any more information beyond noting that it's in development.

## New look at Control Resonant

Remedy shared an extended look at its _Control_ sequel, [_Control: Resonant_](https://www.polygon.com/control-resonant-gameplay-trailer-first-look-ps5-state-of-play-remedy/). It stars Dylan Faden, the brother of the first game’s protagonist, who primarily wields melee weapons, and showed melee combat and gravitational platforming. No release date was shared, but Remedy promised more information later in 2026.

## Crimson Moon revealed

The Gothic ARPG _Crimson Moon_ was revealed in all its bloody glory. You'll play as a human-angel hybrid, and will be able to team up with a friend in co-op mode.

## Mina the Hollower demo tomorrow

_Mina the Hollower_ is coming this spring, but you can try it out tomorrow via a demo. All your progress will transfer over to the full game when it launches. It’s from the team behind _Shovel Knight_, so it’s an indie to keep an eye on.

## Neva: Prologue announced

2024 indie hit [_Neva_](https://www.polygon.com/review/465091/neva-review-nomada-devolver-digital/) — a true heartbreaker if there ever was one — is getting a DLC prequel next week when _Neva: Prologue_ launches.

## Yakoh Shinobi Ops revealed

_Yahoh Shonibi Ops_ is an isometric stealth action game with some big ol’ monsters coming in 2027.

## 007: First Light

[_Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.2_](https://www.polygon.com/metal-gear-solid-4-is-finally-getting-freed/) launches Aug. 27. It'll include _Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots_, _Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker_, and _Metal Gear: Ghost Babel_, the first handheld Metal Gear game. Konami also announced...

It’s planned for a 2026 release.

## Rev. Noir revealed

_Rev. Noir_ is an upcoming JRPG from Konami. Looks cool! But the company didn't reveal much.

## Be seeing you, John Wick

Lionsgate revealed a violent and [action-packed John Wick game](https://www.polygon.com/john-wick-game-untitled-real-gameplay-ps5-reveal-trailer/). In it, the former hitman goes to town on enemies using guns and improvised weapons, like a frying pan. Though it's not the first John Wick game, it's the first one that appears — at least at this first glance — to be faithful to the films.

## You can play Marathon in two weeks

Sony showed off a creepy look at _Marathon_ and announced an [open preview from Feb. 26 to March 2](https://www.polygon.com/marathon-state-of-play-february-2026/). _Marathon_ will be released on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X, following a very public (and troubled) development cycle.

## Saros continues to look like the action GOTY for 2026

Sony revealed new _Saros_ footage at the State of Play, and did so [without quietly delaying](https://www.polygon.com/tga-the-game-awards-2025-biggest-reveals-trailers-announcements/#:~:text=Housemarque%20shares%20fresh%20look%20at%20Saros%20as%20it%20gets%20quietly%20delayed) the game this time. It’s on track to be released April 30 for PlayStation 5 — a date that cannot get here soon enough.
