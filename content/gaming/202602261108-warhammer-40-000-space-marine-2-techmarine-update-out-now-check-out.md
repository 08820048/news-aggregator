Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2’s long-awaited Techmarine update is out now across all platforms as part of patch 12.0. It adds the new Techmarine class, a new melee weapon, a new Operation, DLCs, and balance updates.

The Techmarine is the big draw here. The new playable class — the first to hit the explosive third-person action game since launch — has a unique Servo-Gun ability that locks onto enemies in a line of sight and automatically fires at them while the Techmarine continues fighting in melee or range. It also has access to the new Omnissian Axe, which can deal massive damage to both a single target with its standard attacks and to surrounding enemies with its finishing heavy attacks.

“We hope you will really like the new class,” game director Dmitry Grigorenko said in [a post on publisher Focus Entertainment’s website](https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/356-patch-notes-12-0). “We've tried to make sure that this class plays differently from the rest.”

A number of changes were made based on feedback from the recent PTS, outlined in the patch notes below. “We've tried to address most of it, but there are some big changes that we didn't have time to implement,” Grigorenko explained. “There will be more improvements and perks reworks in upcoming patches.”

Elsewhere, patch 12.0 heralds the addition of Space Marine 2's first voice pack, which costs $4.99. This is _not_ included in the Season Pass (and thus has [upset some players who believe it should be part of the premium DLC package](https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/343-january-community-update#post-6777)). It includes 450 re-recorded voicelines and a unique Space Marine Head cosmetic for each of the following Space Marine chapters: Blood Angels, Space Wolves, and Black Templars.

-   Increased spawn rate of turrets by ~50%.

## GAMEPLAY AND BALANCING TWEAKS

### PvE Perks

**Tactical**

**Balanced Distribution**: Both negative and positive effects are increased from 10% to 15%.

**Kraken Penetrator Rounds**: All bolter weapons now deal 50% more damage with body shots.

🟡 **Changes from PTS:**

-   Kraken Penetrator Rounds now correctly apply to bolter rounds only.

_Game Director’s note_:

_We hear your feedback regarding bolters doing too little body damage._

_This behavior is kind of intentional. The reason is that Space Marine 2’s engagement distances and recoil are extremely low, while average enemy size is rather big. It's very difficult to completely miss your enemies. This is why the only skill element of ranged combat is to aim for the head, and this is why head shots are so important for bolt weapons._

_That being said, I agree that we've overtuned headshots way too much, especially with how different perks and multipliers stack with each other. We will reduce the gap between body shots and head shots. But it's not going to be as easy as applying this perk by default to everybody._

_We need to adjust base damage of all bolter weapons and then adjust damage sensitivity on all enemies and do it case by case. So, a big overhaul is coming in this area rather soon, but do keep in mind that aiming for the head will remain the proper way of using bolters._

**Sniper**

**Efficient Readiness**: Now the effect lasts 5 seconds after deactivation.

**Ambush**: Now forces stagger to the enemies.
