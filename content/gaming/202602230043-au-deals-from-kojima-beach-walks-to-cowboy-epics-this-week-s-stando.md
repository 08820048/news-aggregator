I have played most of what is sitting below, and a few of these still live rent free in my head. This week's spread is less about filler and more about games that either defined a genre or quietly perfected it. If your backlog is already judging you, add two more and call it character building.

## **This Day in Gaming 🎂**

In retro news, I'm celebrating the 13th birthday of the **PlayStation Vita**. Though its life cycle wasn't one of roaring success, I still have a soft spot in my heart for its gorgeous OLED screen, impressive tech specs and games like **Uncharted: Golden Abyss**, **Gravity Rush**, and **Hotline Miami**.

The PS Vita + Hotline Miami combo. So good, people were still _dying_ to play it in 2038.

Aussie birthdays for notable games.

## Nice Savings for Nintendo Switch

-   [Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds](https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000053196) (-40%) - A$**50.90** Fast, colourful kart chaos with Sega fan service everywhere. Handling takes a minute to click, but once it does the shortcuts and drift boosts feel earned rather than random.
-   [Super Mario RPG](https://www.amazon.com.au/Super-Mario-RPG/dp/B08WYWTMYL?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-38%) - A$**49.90** A charming remake of a quietly odd Mario spin off. The timed hits keep combat engaging, even if it is breezy by modern RPG standards.
-   [Rayman Legends Def.](https://www.amazon.com.au/Rayman-Legends-Definitive-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0B1Q2BZ3R?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-67%) - A$**19.90** Still one of the best 2D platformers ever made. Tight controls, absurd creativity, and music levels that feel like playable cartoons.
-   [NBA 2K26](https://www.amazon.com.au/2K-NBA-2K26-Switch-CIB/dp/B0FXKY5CBR?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-67%) - A$**29.90** Slick on court presentation and deep modes, even if the microtransaction pressure never fully leaves the building.
-   [Dead Cells](https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000007705) (-50%) - A$**18.70** A brutally efficient roguelite that rewards smart aggression. Runs are quick, builds are flexible, and it still finds ways to surprise.

Or gift a [**Nintendo eShop Card**](https://zdcs.link/V0MbJ?object_uuid=8a1b6768-7bfa-4797-8d57-1b187c5e33e0&t=article).

## Exciting Bargains for Xbox

[

](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/09/14/residentevil4dlcrevealtrailer-ign-blogroll-1694730528241.jpg)

-   [Resident Evil 4](https://www.amazon.com.au/Resident-Evil-4/dp/B0BJTSN9ZC?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-42%) - A$**34.90** A confident remake that sharpens combat without losing the original's camp edge. Parrying alone makes it worth revisiting.
-   [Red Dead Redemption 2](https://www.amazon.com.au/Red-Dead-Redemption-2/dp/B079J83X2C?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-68%) - A$**29** A slow burn western obsessed with detail. The pacing demands patience, but the world building is still unmatched.
-   [Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain](https://www.amazon.com.au/METAL-GEAR-SOLID-V-THE-PHANTOM-PAIN/dp/B00JKM06FI?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-49%) - A$**36.60** Systems driven stealth at its peak. The story wobbles late, but the sandbox freedom is still absurdly good.
-   [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/p/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-splintered-fate/9NM22MRRMX6Z/0010?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-75%) - A$**11.20** A punchy roguelike spin on the Turtles. Co op shines, solo is tougher, but at this price it is easy to recommend.

Or just invest in an [**Xbox Card**](https://zdcs.link/glwRb?object_uuid=8a1b6768-7bfa-4797-8d57-1b187c5e33e0&t=article).

## **Pure Scores for PlayStation**

[

](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/21/deathstrandingthumb-1763742359840.png)

-   [Death Stranding 2](https://www.amazon.com.au/DEATH-STRANDING-2-ON-THE-BEACH/dp/B0F17XR83J?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-21%) - A$**99** Kojima doubling down on strange ideas and long walks. Not for everyone, but undeniably singular.
-   [Dead Space](https://www.amazon.com.au/Dead-Space/dp/B0BHH3F42H?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-73%) - A$**29.90** A remake that respects the original's dread. Audio design does half the work, and it still gets under your skin.
-   [Elden Ring](https://www.amazon.com.au/ELDEN-RING/dp/B0972SJXRY?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-45%) - A$**54.90** Vast, punishing, and strangely inviting. Exploration feels self directed, even when the bosses absolutely flatten you.
-   [Tekken 8](https://www.amazon.com.au/TEKKEN-8/dp/B0CGH9ZYTG?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-48%) - A$**44** Flashy, aggressive, and mechanically dense. The new Heat system rewards confidence, but button mashers will be exposed quickly.
-   [The Last of Us Part I](https://www.amazon.com.au/The-Last-of-Us-Part-I/dp/B0B3QM9313?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-36%) - A$**79.90** A technical overhaul of a modern classic. Still emotionally heavy, still deliberate, and still worth revisiting.

PS4

-   [Dragon Ball FighterZ](https://www.amazon.com.au/DRAGON-BALL-FIGHTERZ/dp/B0793GS8NL?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-61%) - A$**38.60** Arc System Works turning anime chaos into tight competitive combat. Accessible early, brutally technical later.
-   [Assassin's Creed Odyssey](https://www.amazon.com.au/Assassins-Creed-Odyssey/dp/B07JV9NH7Q?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-50%) - A$**49.40** A massive Greek playground with more quests than restraint. Great if you want value, less so if you crave brevity.
-   [Neo: The World Ends With You](https://www.amazon.com.au/NEO-The-World-Ends-with-You/dp/B0929GQJLV?tag=ign_au-22&ascsubtag=) (-57%) - A$**39** Stylish, frantic combat wrapped in sharp writing. The systems take time to click, but the vibe carries it.

Or purchase a [**PS Store Card.**](https://zdcs.link/kn6Ww?object_uuid=8a1b6768-7bfa-4797-8d57-1b187c5e33e0&t=article)

## Purchase Cheap for PC

[

](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/13/warhammer3thumb-1741885234601.png)

-   [Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2183900/Warhammer_40000_Space_Marine_2) (-67%) - A$**29.60** Loud, weighty third person action that understands scale. Narrative is pure pulp, but the combat spectacle delivers.
-   [Outer Wilds](https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds) (-50%) - A$**18.40** A time loop mystery built on curiosity. No hand holding, just smart design and genuine discovery.
-   [Neon White](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1533420/Neon_White) (-60%) - A$**14.60** Speedrunning as a first person shooter puzzle. Messy dialogue aside, the flow state is undeniable.
-   [Persona 5 Royal](https://zdcs.link/QG8VR8?object_uuid=8a1b6768-7bfa-4797-8d57-1b187c5e33e0&t=article) (-73%) - A$**26.10** Stylish turn based combat and social sim depth that eats your calendar. Long, yes, but rarely dull.
-   [Hades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades) (-65%) - A$**12.70** Combat that feels immediate and writing that never wastes a line. Still the roguelike most others chase.

Or just get a [**Steam Wallet Card**](https://zdcs.link/vdlm8?object_uuid=8a1b6768-7bfa-4797-8d57-1b187c5e33e0&t=article)
