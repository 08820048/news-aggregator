Following an [unexpected delay](https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-2-delayed-to-february-as-ea-tackles-community-feedback-with-an-extended-season-1) in January, the first trailer for [Battlefield 6](https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6) Season 2 is here, revealing a first look at its three-month roadmap, a limited-time nightfall event, and gameplay for two new maps.

EA and Battlefield Studios today offered a detailed breakdown and trailer for the second seasonal content update, along with a gameplay trailer for its troubled multiplayer FPS. Season 2 spans across three phases – Extreme Measures (phase one), Nightfall (phase two), and Hunter/Prey (phase three) – with the first set to launch next week on its previously announced release date of February 17, 2026.

The forest-covered mountains of the first new map, Contaminated, are the backdrop for most of the Battlefield 6 Season 2 trailer, providing a first look at new vehicles, such as the AH-6 Little Bird, and a new psychoactive smoke mechanic. First gameplay for the location, which supports all combat sizes, shows tanks and helicopters chasing infantry into at least partially destructible tunnels. Players can enjoy all it has to offer across standard multiplayer game mode as well as the new VL-7 Strike limited-time mode, which sees players battling (and hallucinating) through the smoke in its own dedicated playlist.

Extreme Measures kicks things off with Contaminated, the Little Bird, VL-7 smoke, new weapons, and more next week. Come March 17, phase two, Nightfall, will then finally add one of the community’s most-asked-for features… kind of.

Along with its new close-quarters infantry map, Hagental Base, Nightfall brings night gameplay to Battlefield 6. Players have wanted to turn out the lights since the sixth mainline installment launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S last October. Unfortunately, it seems lights-out action will be restricted only to the limited-time Nightfall event, which itself is only available on Hagental Base. REDSEC players can also try out the night map via the limited-time Gauntlet mode, with the Nightfall phase also adding the Defense Testing Complex 3 point of interest to Fort Lyndon, as well as the dirt bike, CZ3A1 submachine gun, and VZ.61 sidearm across both experiences.

Finally, phase three, Hunter / Prey, launches April 14. It does not add a new map, and instead brings the Operation Augur limited-time mode, Portal updates, a new bonus path for the battle pass, the LTV vehicle, and the Ripper 14” machete.

BF Studios says update 1.2.1.0 will launch alongside Battlefield 6 Season 2 and adds “hundreds of gameplay improvements, fixes, and individual updates.” Included in the update are balance adjustments for weapons, such as what it calls “widespread recoil tuning across automatic weapons.” Patch notes are not available yet but are promised to arrive prior to the launch of Extreme Measures next week.

Battlefield 6 got off to [a strong start in 2025](https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-was-the-best-selling-console-of-2025-in-the-us-and-is-still-outpacing-the-nintendo-switch) but has faced backlash from its community in recent weeks. As some players [review-bombed its battle royale REDSEC offshoot](https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-respond-to-redsec-review-bombing-this-is-just-the-beginning-of-the-experience) and others [pleaded for larger maps](https://www.ign.com/articles/this-is-brilliant-battlefield-6-players-flock-to-giant-fan-made-conquest-maps-as-map-size-debate-rages-on), many began to question if two maps per season were enough to keep players engaged. Confusion then reached [new levels in January](https://www.ign.com/articles/losing-steam-3-months-after-launch-its-time-for-a-check-in-with-battlefield-6-and-its-community), when EA and BF Studios announced Season 2 had been delayed to its February 17 release date.

It’s unclear if the content revealed today will be enough to satisfy those displeased with the post-launch content so far.
