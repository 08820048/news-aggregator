Toy Fair 2026 is just around the corner, meaning a lot of companies are gearing up to reveal new toys and figures hitting shelves in 2026 and beyond. IGN can offer an exclusive first look at the newest Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles offerings from Super7.

Check out the slideshow gallery below for a closer look at Super7's newest TMNT Ultimates and Reaction+ figures:

With the TMNT Ultimates line, Super7 has shifted from releasing figures inspired by the classic '80s TMNT toys to focusing on the 2003 animated series. Fans can expect three new 7-inch-scale figures in the next Ultimates wave - Raphael (Road Gear), April O'Neil, and Hun. All three figures are designed to be compatible with a Shell Cycle vehicle and will come with interchangeable helmeted heads.

The TMNT Ultimates figures are priced at $65 each, while the Shell Cycle is $150.

On the Reaction+ front, this marks the first time Super7 will include the TMNT franchise in that long-running line of retro-style figures. Like all Reaction+ figures, these toys are similar in size and style to classic G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero figures and feature similar O-ring construction. The figures are inspired by the 1987 animated series, with this first wave including Raphael, Donatello, Shredder, and a Foot Ninja.

The TMNT Reaction+ figures are priced at $25 each.
