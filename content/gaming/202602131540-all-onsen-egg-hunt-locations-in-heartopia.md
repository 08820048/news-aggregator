These colorful onsen eggs are part of the "**Onsen Egg Promise Treasure Hunt**" portion of the event, and each egg you find will reward you with **five Wishing Stars** and **300 Fashionwave Tokens**, a special currency you can use to score event-limited furniture, clothing, emotes, and vehicles.

You can see all the egg hunt locations in _Heartopia_ below, with the newest eggs appearing at the top.

## How the Heartopia egg hunt event works

To "hunt" the egg, you'll just need to take a photo of it. A text box will appear to identify the egg, similarly to how text appears to identify birds as part of the bird watching hobby. Once you snap the photo, you'll get the rewards. One new egg appears every day and you can see which eggs you've found in the "fashion activity" section of the event screen. So far, all of them are found within the Winter Utopia event area, which is the northern beach portion of Onsen Mountain.

If you don't have access to this stuff yet, you probably need to level up a bit more. You'll need to be at least D.G. Member Level seven and you'll need to be done with the beginner main story quests.
