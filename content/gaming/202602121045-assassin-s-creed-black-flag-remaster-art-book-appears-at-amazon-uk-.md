summary: "The heavily rumoured, but yet to be confirmed, Assassin's Creed Black Flag Remake/Remaster is getting its very own art book, at least according to this recent Amazon listing in the UK. Preorders are also now available, strangely, before we've got official confirmation of the game actually being real and given its own release window. Its art book is listed at £29.95 right now, a slight reduction from its initial £39.99 RRP, and the Amazon listing also mentions a release date of March 24, 2026."

## That's a bit strange, isn't it?

The heavily rumoured, but yet to be confirmed, Assassin's Creed Black Flag Remake/Remaster is getting its very own art book, at least according to this recent [Amazon listing in the UK](https://zdcs.link/zE8bmM?object_uuid=1a1d59dc-8771-453c-8252-d784c9931c6c&t=article).

Preorders are also now available, strangely, before we've got official confirmation of the game _actually_ being real and given its own release window. Its art book is listed at £29.95 right now, a slight reduction from its initial £39.99 RRP, and the Amazon listing also mentions a release date of March 24, 2026.

Release Date: March 24, 2026

### Assassin's Creed Black Flag Remaster - Art Book

Titan will be publishing the art book, and the publisher already has a history of releasing [art books for the gaming franchise since 2012](https://zdcs.link/91wXK3?object_uuid=1a1d59dc-8771-453c-8252-d784c9931c6c&t=article). That includes Assassin's Creed III, Unity, Syndicate, Origins, and more.

More recent Assassin's Creed art books have also been published by Dark Horse, a separate publishing house, including Shadows, Mirage, and The Making of Assassin's Creed: 15th Anniversary.

According to recent listings on the PEGI European ratings board website, the [official name of the long- awaited remake is Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced](https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-is-the-name-of-ubisofts-long-awaited-pirate-remake).

And yet, [after years of internal leaks](https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-confirms-multiple-assassins-creed-remakes-are-on-the-way), relentless fan speculation, and even [not-so-subtle nudges from the original game’s lead actor](https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-edward-kenway-actor-alleges-ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-him-for-hinting-at-black-flag-remake), Ubisoft still refuses to officially acknowledge that a Black Flag remake is real.

[Earlier reports claim Black Flag Resynced](https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-release-date-reportedly-leaked) is shaping up to be a full-scale overhaul of the series' fan-favourite pirate outing, with [meaningful visual and gameplay upgrades designed](https://www.ign.com/articles/stop-removing-the-modern-day-assassins-creed-fans-react-as-black-flag-remake-reportedly-cuts-everything-outside-the-animus) to bring it more in line with the production standards of last year's Assassin's Creed Shadows.
