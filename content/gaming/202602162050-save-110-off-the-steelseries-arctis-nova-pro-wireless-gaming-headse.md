Just for Presidents Day, Steelseries direct is offering a great deal on one of its [top rated gaming headsets](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-headset). Right now you can pick up a [SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro](https://zdcs.link/aX4DWO?object_uuid=01ff2783-ef73-4c91-906a-b469ecc0f6c4&t=article) wireless gaming headset for just $269.99 after coupon code "**PRESDAY10**". Not only is that 30% off its retail price of $380, it even comes bundled with a free QcK Vector mousepad. This is the lowest price I've seen for this headset in 2026, which is impressive since [SteelSeries recently raised the prices on its headsets](https://www.ign.com/articles/gaming-accessories-worth-buying-before-tariffs) as a response to the tariffs. This model is compatible with PS5 and PC (not Xbox).

### SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless Gaming Headset (Xbox, PC)

The Arctis Nova Pro is one of the highest-end gaming headsets in SteelSeries' repertoire. Only the [Nova Elite](https://zdcs.link/9yGMVe?object_uuid=01ff2783-ef73-4c91-906a-b469ecc0f6c4&t=article), which retails for $600, is higher up the ladder. Like any proper top-of-the-line headset, the Nova Pro boasts excellent sound quality, all-day comfort thanks to a suspension style headband and leatherette ear cushions, high-performance retractable boom mic, simultaneous 2.4GHz WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity, and even active noise cancelation (rare for a gaming headset).

However, the one feature that undoubtedly makes the Nova Pro stand out is the ingenious **hot-swappable battery system**. The Nova Pro includes two removable, rechargeable batteries so that while one is currently in use in your headset, the other stays topped up in a base station that also doubles as a battery charger. This way, you get [wireless freedom with no charge anxiety](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-wireless-gaming-headset). Each battery lasts for up to 22 hours of continued use so you don't need to swap out too often.

The base station deserves mention as well. Not only does it charge your battery, it also features a clear and legible OLED display and a handy volume control knob. On the rear are USB inputs for connecting to your PC as well as an optional 3.5mm passthrough should you want to connect your speakers directly to the base station.

The Nova Pro wireless has been my primary gaming headset for years and I absolutely recommend them. I've since upgraded the stock earcups to these aftermarket [WC Freeze gel earpads](https://zdcs.link/zn50mq?object_uuid=01ff2783-ef73-4c91-906a-b469ecc0f6c4&t=article) and quite like them as well. Check out our [Steelseries Arctis Nova Pro review](https://www.ign.com/articles/steelseries-arctis-nova-pro-wireless) by Kevin Lee for yet another positive take.
