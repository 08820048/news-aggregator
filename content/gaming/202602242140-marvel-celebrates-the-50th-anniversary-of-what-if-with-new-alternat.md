summary: "Marvel has revealed a new batch of What If? comics for 2026, including one that offers a fresh take on one of the most controversial X-Men storylines of all time."
---
Believe it or not, Marvel's long-running What If? series turns 50 this year. That's a lot of alternate universe superhero stories. But there's still plenty more ground left to cover, as Marvel reveals a brand new batch of What If? comics publishing in Summer 2026.

There's no particular unifying theme this time around. These What If? books stick to the classic formula, with each exploring realities where iconic Marvel storylines played out differently. For example, one of these issues is titled "What If... Cyclops Had Stayed With Madelyne Pryor?", revealing a world where Cyclops never left his wife and child to reunite with the newly resurrected Jean Grey. For a lot of X-fans, Cyclops ditching his family remains a black mark on the character's legacy even decades later, so we imagine there's going to be a lot of interest in this story.
