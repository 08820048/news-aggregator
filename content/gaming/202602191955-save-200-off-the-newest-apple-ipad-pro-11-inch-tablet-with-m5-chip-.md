### Apple iPad Pro 11-Inch (M5) 256GB

In IGN's [iPad Pro review](https://www.ign.com/articles/ipad-pro-m4-2024-review), Jacqueline Thomas wrote, "For creative professionals, the iPad Pro is the most powerful tablet on the market and is going to shine if your work revolves around a touchscreen... the iPad Pro is simply the most beautiful display you'll find in a tablet, with hardware that's powerful enough to be a top-end device for years to come."

The 2025 iPad Pro is currently [best tablet](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-ipad-models) on the market, iOS or otherwise, thanks to the new M5 processor which is both powerful and power efficient. Compared to the previous generation iPad M4, it offers about 15% faster CPU and GPU performance, 50% more RAM, faster storage speed, Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6 standards, and faster charging.

The iPad Pro M5 features a gorgeous tandem OLED panel which hadn't previously been seen on an Apple product prior to the iPad Pro M4. Tandem OLED is better than traditional OLED in two ways: 1) it's far brighter, and 2) it's less prone to burn-in. If you're wondering why this technology hasn't found its way into TVs, the answer is simply because it's not cost-effective at larger sizes. The iPad can get away with it because the 11" screen is much smaller, but that's also a major reason why the iPad Pro is priced considerably higher than the other iPad models.
