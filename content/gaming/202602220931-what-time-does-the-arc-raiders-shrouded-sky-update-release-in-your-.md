The **_Arc Raiders_** **Shrouded Sky update** is February's installment on the roadmap that Embark Studios published last month, and it's the chunkiest one there in terms of the sheer quantity and variety of new content we're getting. It follows Headwinds in January, which added things like the [Trophy Display](https://www.polygon.com/arc-raiders-trophy-display-project-resources-materials-rewards/) project and the Bird City map condition, while Flashpoint will come in March, followed by Riven Tides in April. This is all part of an overarching group of [_Arc Raiders_](https://www.polygon.com/game/arc-raiders/443837/) updates called Escalation.

Here's **when** **_Arc Raiders_** **Shrouded Sky releases in your time zone**, along with details on what to expect.

## Arc Raiders Shrouded Sky update release time in your time zone

While we know the **Shrouded Sky update release date** is on Tuesday, Feb. 24, Embark Studios doesn't usually reveal the release time in advance. However, previous updates have typically happened at **4:30 a.m. EST**, so we're expecting Shrouded Sky to be at the same time.

Here's how that looks in your time zone:

-   **1:30 a.m. PST** for the west coast of North America
-   **4:30 a.m. EST** for the east coast of North America
-   **6:30 a.m. BRT** for Brazil
-   **9:30 a.m. GMT** for the United Kingdom
-   **10:30 a.m. CET** for western Europe
-   **6:30 p.m. JST** for Japan
-   **8:30 p.m. AEDT** for the east coast of Australia

## What to expect from the Arc Raiders Shrouded Sky update

    ![The Arc Raiders roadmap for January until April, detailing what's coming to the game.](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-release-time-roadmap.jpg?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2)Image: Embark Studios

The roadmap image above lists the categories for everything new coming with Shrouded Sky, and while most of them are still vague and we can only speculate, we do know exactly what to expect with the new map condition thanks to a [blog post](https://arcraiders.com/news/surviving-the-hurricane-map-condition). Called "Hurricane," players will need to deal with strong winds. When you're in a tailwind, you'll get a boost of speed, but the reverse will happen when fighting against it. Throwables will also "behave differently," which we expect means they'll be taken in whatever direction the wind is blowing.

The wind will also pick up debris, and as you're hit by it, your shield will "glitch and spark." Unequipping your shield when out in the open is actually recommended because even though you'll be more vulnerable, you'll be much harder to spot by other raiders. This low visibility also impacts Arc enemies, which means you can stumble upon them in the dark. Finally, raider caches from the first wave are being uncovered, leading to more valuable loot.

Next up is the "new Arc threat," and the word "threat" is the key part here: it _doesn't_ say it'll necessarily be an entirely new enemy. The popular theory online is that the Shredders that populate Stella Montis will escape, making their way to some of the other maps, most notably Blue Gate. Rumor has it, the barricaded tunnels there lead directly to Stella Montis.

Finally, the "map update" is definitely not an entirely new map — we know we're getting one of those in April — but likely significant updates to the existing maps. We could see another building or two on Buried City, doors opened for more pathways on Stella Montis, or maybe a natural disaster will cause structures on Spaceport to collapse. These are all just theories though, as we know very little at the moment.

Alongside these, there'll be a new project to complete, a new raider deck, and the expedition window will begin. There's a high chance of new quests to complete too, although if you embark on the expedition, these won't be available to you until you complete most of the existing quests in the game.
