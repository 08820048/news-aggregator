Here's his public statement, in full:

> It’s rare in life to know when a chapter is closing, but after 38 years at Microsoft, that moment has arrived for me. I’ve made the decision to retire and begin the next chapter of my life. It’s a milestone that’s given me a chance to reflect on the incredible journey I’ve been fortunate enough to share with so many of you.

> I’m excited for \[Asha Sharma\] as she steps into the CEO role. She’s joining an incredible group of people; teams full of talent, heart, and a deep commitment to the players they serve. Watching her lean in with curiosity and a real desire to strengthen the foundation we've built gives me confidence that our Xbox communities will be well supported in the years ahead.

> Thinking back to my start as an intern in 1988, I never could have imagined the path ahead. I’ve been lucky to work with so many passionate creators, partners, colleagues, and players across the industry; people who challenged me, taught me, and made this work full of joy and wonder.

> Thank you to everyone who’s been part of this chapter. This community has meant more to me than I can say.

> From here, I’ll keep doing what’s always mattered so much to me: cheering on the teams pushing this industry forward and playing alongside this incredible community. I'll see you online.

Spencer has, as stated, been with Microsoft fo 38 years, beginning in 1988 as an intern and joining the Xbox team in 2001, eventually being named head of Xbox in 2014. At the time, Spencer's task was to set the division on course again after a series of product and policy decisions that had left the Xbox community frustrated. Spencer has been known throughout his tenure as one of the few gaming executives in the industry who was himself openly a gamer, often playing with community members and showing off his various achievements in Xbox games over the years.

Spencer led initiatives such as the launch of Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Play Anywhere, numerous accessibility achievements, and oversaw the release of the Xbox Series consoles. He also instigated numerous studio acquisitions, [beginning with Playground Games, Undead Labs, Ninja Theory, and Compulsion in 2018](https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/10/e3-2018-microsoft-acquires-playground-games-undead-labs-ninja-theory-and-compulsion-games) and capping it off by picking up [Activision Blizzard in 2022 for $69 billion](https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-activision-blizzard-buy-acquisition-acquired). In recent years, he has continued to steer Xbox amid growing criticism of the brand for its lack of strong first-party exclusives, ongoing price increases, and decreased value of Game Pass.

Spencer's retirement will officially take effect on February 23, 2026.
