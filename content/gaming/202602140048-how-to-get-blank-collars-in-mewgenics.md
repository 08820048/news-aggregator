What's better than one Tank? Two tanks!

**Blank Collars** are a type of "[class](https://www.polygon.com/mewgenics-classes-collars-how-to-unlock/)" in [_Mewgenics_](https://www.polygon.com/game/mew-genics/3325/), but it functions a little differently when compared to the other collars.

After you purchase the Blank Collar from Tracy, it'll get added to your collection of collars. However, rather than adding a "blank collar" to the set, you'll spot a duplicate of one of the collars you own — allowing you to take multiple cats of the same class out on an adventure.

Here's **everything you need to know about Blank Collars in _Mewgenics_** and how to use them.

## How to get Blank Collars in Mewgenics

Blank Collars allow you to take multiple cats of the same class out on an adventure in _Mewgenics_. However, you must first unlock a Blank Collar through Tracy. You'll unlock Tracy fairly early on in your playthrough, but she won't have Blank Collars stocked immediately. To get Blank Collars in her shop, you'll need to first donate one cat age five or older to Tracy to unlock the food storage upgrade, and then **donate 10 more cats to unlock the first Blank Collar**.

However, you won't unlock the Blank Collar. Instead, you'll unlock the rights to **purchase the collar from her shop for 150 coins**.

After you purchase the first, you'll need to **send Tracy** **40 more cats to unlock the second Blank Collar**, and **40 more after that to unlock the third Blank Collar**.

## How to use Blank Collars in Mewgenics

To use Blank Collars in _Mewgenics_, you'll need to start an adventure. Choose your fated party of cats and place them in the box to view the Collars menu. Blank Collars in this menu won't appear as a blank collar, but instead as a **duplicate of one of the collars you already own**. As seen in the image above, our Blank Collar took on the role of a Mage. However, the class that the Blank Collar takes on will be **randomized every adventure**. If you have multiple Blank Collars, you'll have even more duplicates. This does mean that you'll be able to take multiple cats of the same class, so, if you'd like half of your party to be made up of Tanks or Clerics, you're free to do so!

Additionally, Blank Collars are permanent, so don't feel the need to save them to use on a difficult run later on as they'll last from one adventure to the next. However, don't forget that the Blank Collar will most likely be a different class on the next adventure.
