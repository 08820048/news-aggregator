Epic has claimed a 57% YoY increase in third-party game revenue on the Epic Games Store, a 4% increase in time spent in third-party games and a record level of 78 million monthly active users in December, in a blog post summarising its performance for 2025. The store now lists over 6,000 games.

Spending on third-party games reached $400 million (£293 million), the company said, highlighting that this did not include transactions for in-game purchases through third-party stores, which the company does not charge a commission on. Total spend for the store for the year was $1.16b billion (£847 million).

The top PC games on the platform in 2025 were Fortnite, Wuthering Waves, Honkai Star Rail, Rocket League and Genshin Impact. The second tier contained EA SPORTS FC 26, Zenless Zone Zero, GTA 5, Dead by Daylight and Infinity Nikki. The company did not provide per-title sales figures.

While the monthly active user total was up in December, driven by a giveawy of Hogwarts Legacy, overall total player hours of 6.65 billion were down 14% YoY, driven by an unspecified decline in first-party titles. Analysts have previously warned that [live-service games like Fortnite have peaked in popularity](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/bcg-live-service-titles-like-fortnite-have-peaked-but-roblox-is-still-growing). Time spent on third-party titles was up 4% to 2.78 billion hours.

The company said that its free games program, which gives away titles each month, was delivering a "measurable halo effect across the broader PC ecosystem," citing a 40% uplift in Steam CCU while a title is free on the Epic store. Players claimed 662 million titles through the progam in 2025, and over 77% of them saw an all-time peak CCU count during the promotion period.

The company saw "all-time highs" in developer participation in [Epic First Run](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/epic-games-store-to-trade-revenue-share-for-exclusivity-window), which grants developers 100% of revenue for the first six months if the game is exclusively launched on the Epic Game Store, although it did not share figures. The company [launched a Web Shops service for PC and mobile in October 2025](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/epic-games-launches-webshop-service-on-pc-and-mobile), which uses the company's ecommerce platform and passes developers their first $1 million in revenue commission-free before reverting to an 88/22 split.

Despite this, the Epic Games Store remains a distant second place to Steam in revenue terms. A survey in November said that for a majority of developers, [Steam represented over 75% of their revenue](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/72-of-devs-believe-steam-has-a-monopoly-on-pc-games-according-to-study).

In an [interview with _GamesIndustry.biz_](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/were-not-going-to-topple-steam-epic-games-store-head-steve-allison-heralds-the-path-of-co-existence), Epic Games Store GM Steve Allison said that the aim was not to "topple" Steam. "Our growth is not about the exclusives," he said. "Our growth is going to come from shifting the share of sales on games shipping in both places."
