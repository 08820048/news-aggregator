The world of Keanu Reeves' BRZRKR continues to expand in 2026. IGN can exclusively reveal that Reeves is reuniting with author China Miéville for a new spinoff comic called BRZRKR: Light Draws Breath #1.

Check out the slideshow gallery below for an exclusive first look at BRZRKR: Light Draws Breath #1, including uncolored interior pages and character designs:

Miéville previously penned the 2024 spinoff novel The Story of Elsewhere, but this will mark the first time he's co-written a BRZRKR comic, or any comic outside of DC. Reeves and Miéville are collaborating with artist Alessio Avalone. Esad Ribic provides the main cover to this one-shot issue, while Ronald Wimberly, David Lafuente, Dillon Snook, and Sweeny Boo will handle variant covers.

Like the other BRZRKR spinoff comics, Light Draws Breath is set earlier in the life of immortal warrior B. Set in the Bronze Age, this issue explores what happens when B temporarily dies and part of his protoplasmic body is harvested by rogue scientists. The resulting creation will have to learn who it is and what its place in the world is meant to be.

BRZRKR: Light Draws Breath #1 will be released on May 20, 2026. You can preorder a copy at [your local comic shop](https://www.comicshoplocator.com/).
