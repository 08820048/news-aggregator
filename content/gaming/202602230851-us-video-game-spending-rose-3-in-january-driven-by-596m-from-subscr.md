US consumer spending on video games rose 3% year-on-year to $4.3 billion in January 2026. This growth was driven by a 23% increase in non-mobile subscription services, generating $596 million in revenue.

New data from Circana shows console and PC content spending increased, while mobile saw a slight drop. Hardware spend reached $248 million, up 16% compared to January 2025.

Nintendo Switch 2 revenue offset year-on-year declines for PlayStation 5 (down 17%), Xbox Series X|S (down 27%), and the Nintendo Switch console family (down 79%).

However, PS5 continued to lead the US hardware market in both unit and dollar sales last month, with Switch 2 in second place.

Looking at the Top 20, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 remained in first place, followed by NBA 2K26. Battlefield 6 dropped from No. 3 to No. 5, with Madden NFL 26 taking its spot.

Final Fantasy 7: Remake skyrocketed into the Top 10 from No.225 after the release of its Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S versions. Bandai Namco’s Code Vein 2 was the only new entry to make the charts in January, debuting at No.11.

Fallout 4 just made it into the Top 20, rising from No.68 after the second season of Prime Video’s adaptation. It was the streaming service's [sixth most-watched series of all time](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/fallout-season-2-is-prime-videos-sixth-most-watched-series-of-all-time), while [sales of Fallout games spiked over Christmas](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sales-of-fallout-games-spike-over-christmas-following-launch-of-new-tv-season) following the series premiere.

As for mobile content, Clash Royale fell out of the Top 10, with revenue down 49% in December 2025. Pixel Flow experienced a 79% month-over-month increase in IAP revenue. Scopely recently [acquired a majority stake in its developer, Loom Games](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/scopely-acquires-pixel-flow-developer-loom-games).
