[_Pokémon Go_](https://www.polygon.com/game/pokemon-go/38713)’s **"Lunar New Year 2026"** **event** has kicked off, running from Feb. 17-21, celebrating the Year of the Horse. As part of the event, some horse Pokémon and red Pokémon are taking the spotlight.

During the event, there'll be an increased chance to get [Lucky Pokémon](https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/22567225/lucky-pokemon-friend-trade-rate-odds-benefits-iv/) from trades, become [Lucky Friends](https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/22547598/friendship-xp-level-trade-cost-lucky-friends-odds-chance-rate/), and **some PokéStops may randomly turn gold** without the use of a Golden Lure Module.

As a reminder, Golden PokéStops can drop Gimmighoul Coins when spun, which you'll need to evolve your Gimmighoul into Gholdengo. **Gimmighoul can also be found shiny during this event**, so make sure to grab your [Coin Bags](https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/23616714/gimmighoul-coins-coin-bag-gholdengo-golden-lure/).

Below we list the other perks of _Pokémon Go_'s "Lunar New Year 2026" event, including the premium Timed Research steps, Collection Challenge, and spawns.

## Pokémon Go 'Lunar New Year 2026' premium Timed Research and rewards

This research costs $1.99 and as usual for these Timed Research tasks, you'll need to complete it before the event ends. (I would only recommend buying this research if you want to increase your Blitzle and Darumaka spawns, since their shiny rates are increased during this event.) You can see the steps below.

### 'Lunar New Year 2026' step 1 of 1

-   Catch 2 Pokémon (Blitzle encounter)
-   Catch 2 Pokémon (Darumaka encounter)
-   Catch 4 Pokémon (Blitzle encounter)
-   Catch 4 Pokémon (Darumaka encounter)
-   Catch 6 Pokémon (Blitzle encounter)
-   Catch 6 Pokémon (Darumaka encounter)

-   Send 6 gifts to friends (600 Stardust)

* * *

## Pokémon Go 'Lunar New Year 2026' event boosted spawns

These Pokémon will spawn more frequently during the event period, according to the event blog post:

-   Ponyta
-   Galarian Ponyta
-   Blitzle\*
-   Darumaka\*
-   Fuecoco

Based on the Collection Challenge and our own findings, these should also be spawning in higher numbers:

-   Magikarp
-   Shuckle
-   Sizzlipede
-   Tepig

\*There is an "increased chance" of finding this shiny in the wild as part of the event.
