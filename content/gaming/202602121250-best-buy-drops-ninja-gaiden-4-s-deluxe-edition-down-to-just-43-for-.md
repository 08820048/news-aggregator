Best Buy's latest Deal of the Day has dropped the critically acclaimed [Ninja Gaiden 4 down to just $42.99](https://zdcs.link/9gXPLB?object_uuid=97efdc70-2715-41e9-9ce5-0c48d8de995c&t=article) for **one day only** on Xbox. Not only that, but this is the Deluxe Edition as well, making this discount all the more impressive.

The Deluxe Edition of the game retails for $89.99, so that's a serious $47 saving, and available for just a few dollars more than the game was listed [on sale for at the start of the year ($40)](https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-deal-best-buys-winter-sale-2026), and you're getting a whole lot more for it as well.

### NINJA GAIDEN 4 - Deluxe Edition (Xbox)

So what's included? For just over $40, you're getting the base game, future gameplay content (The Two Masters DLC), exclusive character skins (Traditional Dark Blue, Legendary Black Falcon for Ryu; Divine Chimera, Raven Master for Yakumo), the Blade of the Archfiend weapon skin, 50,000 bonus NinjaCoin, and additional in-game items.

The standout is definitely the DLC content, The Two Masters, which is still expected to release in early 2026, so stay tuned for more news on that.

But, as I mentioned, this deal is also not long for this world. You've got until the end of the day at 11:59 PM ET, February 12, 2026, to secure the discount.

Yeah, yeah, this is also on Xbox Game Pass, but you remember when we used to own games? Those were the days! I have personally been trying to buy more physical games and more physical media in general, and I'd highly recommend others do the same as well.

Think about it this way as well: Game Pass Ultimate is $29.99 per month, and at just $13 more, you can _own_ the game to revisit and play the DLC on as well. That's worth it, at least in my opinion.

Our [review](https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-review) from IGN’s Mitchell Saltzman said, “Despite its disappointing story and bland level design, Ninja Gaiden 4's excellent combat still make it one of the best 3D action games in recent memory.”

It even earned a runner-up nomination for [Best Action Game of 2025](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-action-game-of-2025), as it’s a “pure action fan’s action game, featuring some of the best melee combat we've seen in years, bolstered by aggressive enemy AI, excellent weapon design, and the ability to let your creativity run wild by giving you the freedom to hotswap between all of your weapons on the fly.”
