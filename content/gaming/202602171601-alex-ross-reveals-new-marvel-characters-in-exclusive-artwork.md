## Exclusive Alex Ross art shows off his '200 new Marvel characters' from new graphic novel Marvel Dimensions

Alex Ross' comics career took off in the 1990s with the _Marvels_ and _Kingdom Come_ miniseries, which showcased his interior artwork as well as his covers. Since then, however, most comics readers solely encounter his hyper-realistic, painterly style on the covers of comics like _The Immortal Hulk_ and _Captain America_, not in the pages between. Ross did get to return to interior art in 2022 with his graphic novel [_Fantastic Four: Full Circle_](https://www.polygon.com/23323195/alex-ross-fantastic-four-full-circle-preview/), and he'll be back as a page artist later this year when _Marvel Dimensions_ arrives in bookstores.

Announced earlier this month, _Marvel Dimensions_ is the next work emerging from Ross' partnership with Abrams ComicsArts, which published _Full Circle_. The book will begin by touring through the origins of various iconic Marvel heroes before twisting into something mysterious, as Ross plays with art styles and storytelling formats. "All these things hopefully seem to unify and combine and come back together, but it’s meant to be a wild ride that is throwing everything plus the kitchen sink at you," Ross told [The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/alex-ross-graphic-novel-marvel-dimensions-1236496183/).

In that interview Ross teased that _Marvel Dimensions_ will "about 200 new characters, or at least 200 new variations of characters." Here, Polygon can exclusively present an image from _Marvel Dimensions_ debuting a handful of those new characters.

After poring over this image, Ross creating 200 new characters for the book doesn't seem too far-fetched. The lower left corner appears to include variations on the X-Men, like Cyclops and a cape-wearing Colossus. There's a variation of Black Bolt flying in the top left corner, and nearby are what look like legally distinct versions of DC Comics' Batman and Green Lantern. Mechanical limbs are on full display as a version of Doc Ock is featured in the lower center, while up top, Stilt-Man ambles over to some sort of portal, outlined by [Kirby Krackle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby_Krackle), as what can only be described as a Sentinel with a castle for its head steps through it.

Take a gander at the splash page, and let us know in the comments what fun variants you spot. Plenty more will be revealed in _Marvel Dimensions_ when it releases Sept. 1. [You can pre-order it now](https://www.abramsbooks.com/product/marvel-dimensions_9781419787508/).
