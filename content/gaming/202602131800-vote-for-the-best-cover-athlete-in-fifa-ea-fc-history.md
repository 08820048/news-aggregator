The FIFA/EAFC game franchise has been going strong for more than 30 years, and in that time it’s featured some of the most iconic players in history on the cover. But only one can be crowned the true GOAT, and now is your chance to tell us who that should be.

We’ve created a tournament presented by McDonald’s and their limited-time Hot Honey sauce. Just as these cover athletes elevated the FIFA/EAFC franchise, the Hot Honey sauce elevates your faves to a new level. The tournament will have 32 cover athletes organized into a bracket that you’ll vote on, and they cover just about the entire run of the series, from Erik Thorstvedt (FIFA Soccer 95) to Jude Bellingham and Jamal Musiala (EA FC 26).

Players will face off in 1v1 matchups, with the one who gets the most votes moving on to the next round. All the matchups in each round will be done at the same time, and voting will be conducted through polls on the bottom of the page you’re currently on as well as [IGN’s Instagram stories](https://www.instagram.com/stories/igndotcom/). If you come back to this page on the dates listed below, the polls will be updated to the latest round and you can vote again.
