Violent weather is about to hit the Rust Belt, as developer Embark Studios has revealed a first look at the new Hurricane map condition coming to [Arc Raiders](https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders).

The studio pulled back the curtain on Shrouded Sky, its next major content update, with [a post on its website](https://arcraiders.com/news/surviving-the-hurricane-map-condition). It comes with a sneak peek at how hurricanes will tear through maps like Spaceport, promising what already looks like the most dangerous weather the southern Italy-set video game has faced yet.

Powerful Electromagnetic Storms and wintery Cold Snap conditions have had players seeking shelter before, but Embark says Arc Raiders hasn’t seen anything quite like this. Starting with the launch of Shrouded Sky February 24, Raiders may be subjected to strong winds that will have them rethinking how they approach PvP and PvE.

Searching for topside resources and blueprints during a hurricane will have players fighting both with and against the wind. Running with the storm could provide a small speed boost, for example, but running against it will result in slowed movement and drained stamina. Raiders can also expect everything from gas grenades to trailblazers and other throwables to behave differently when winds pick up.

One look at the trailer makes it clear visibility will be low during a hurricane, but Embark says Arc Raiders players will want to be wary of debris, too. However, like with most other map conditions, the increased threat level means more opportunities to find better loot, with today’s post teasing Raider Caches and relics of the First Wave for those who brave the storm.

Shrouded Sky is Embark’s major update for February and follows the January [Headwinds update](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-big-arc-raiders-update-of-2026-adds-solo-vs-squads-matchmaking-bird-city-and-more-tomorrow). While that relatively small content drop added a solo vs. squads queue option and the Bird City map condition, Shrouded Sky is said to come packed with a Raider Deck and map update, as well as a new Arc threat, which we may have gotten a small glimpse of toward the end of today's trailer. Players can also expect to reset their ranks once again with the launch of [the next Expedition](https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-outlines-expedition-changes-after-players-criticized-steep-reward-requirements) the following day.

The [Arc Raiders roadmap](https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-roadmap-promises-a-new-map-more-arcs-and-even-a-little-love-for-scrappy-by-april-2026) also promised the Flashpoint update for March and Riven Tides for April. The former is said to come with yet another map condition, while the latter’s headlining feature is a brand-new map to raid. We [interviewed Embark CEO Patrick Söderlund](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-arc-raiders-interview-embark-boss-patrick-sderlund-talks-live-service-plans-banning-cheaters-and-the-secret-sauce-of-pve) earlier this month to learn more about what the studio has in store for its popular extraction shooter and how [its success](https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-publisher-boasts-that-the-game-has-significantly-exceeded-expectations-and-now-sold-14-million-copies) has set it [up for a bright future](https://www.ign.com/articles/huge-success-of-arc-raiders-gives-embark-financial-security-and-employment-stability-75-million-budget-estimate-not-too-far-off). Meanwhile, the team is still doing its best to [crack down on cheaters](https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-promises-significant-changes-after-players-report-widespread-issues-with-cheaters) by [issuing suspensions for those who take advantage of in-game exploits](https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-says-players-who-used-recent-exploits-will-face-warnings-and-suspensions-starting-this-week).
