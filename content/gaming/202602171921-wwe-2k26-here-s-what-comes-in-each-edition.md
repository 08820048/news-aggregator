The standard edition of WWE 2K26 comes out March 13 and costs $69.99. It’s available for preorder at most of the usual retailers (with the curious exception of Amazon, at least for the time being). Buy it by March 12 and it will include the preorder bonus (see below).

It’s also worth noting here that the Switch 2 version is a [Game-Key Card](https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-game-cards-will-only-include-a-download-key), so it doesn’t contain the game on it — it just lets you download the game.

## WWE 2K26 King of Kings Edition - $99.99
