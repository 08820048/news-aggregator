This is the reason people think of Muppet movies as classic stories reimagined with all-Muppet casts

On a semi-regular basis, a discussion prompt resurfaces on various social networks that amounts to this question: What movie or book would you like to see adapted with Muppets replacing all of the humans except one? (Frequent follow-up question: And why is it [_Knives Out_](https://www.polygon.com/we-deserve-a-knives-out-muppets-movie-and-wake-up-dead-man-proves-it-could-work/)?) Brian Henson, the director of [_The Muppet Christmas Carol_](https://www.polygon.com/23518742/muppet-christmas-carol-streaming-deleted-song-when-love-is-gone/) and _Muppet Treasure Island_, should take that as a high compliment to his work. The ubiquity of the prompt speaks to how heavily his two Muppet movies loom over the characters’ history, even 30 years after the release of _Treasure Island_ — even if the latter doesn’t fully deserve that status.

At the risk of sounding like that guy from _The Onion_ who [appreciates the Muppets on a much deeper level than you](https://theonion.com/i-appreciate-the-muppets-on-a-much-deeper-level-than-yo-1819583976/), the Muppet movie prompt is strange because the Muppets re-enacting a classic work of literature on the big screen — or any story that’s not at least a nominal original — is almost entirely confined to the 1990s. The main exception is a small-screen variation on this formula, with the Muppets performing _The Wizard of Oz_ for a 2005 network broadcast that featured Ashanti as Dorothy. Combined with the lack of an ongoing _Muppet Show_ equivalent, those two theatrical releases and one TV movie seem to have propagated the misconception that the Muppets’ main job was essentially putting on school plays.

But as a [recent special](https://www.polygon.com/the-muppet-show-disney-special-review/) illustrated, that’s not the only show the Muppets know how to do. The three Muppet films made when creator Jim Henson was still alive — _The Muppet Movie_ (1979), _The Great Muppet Caper_ (1981), and _The Muppets Take Manhattan_ (1984) — were largely reconfigured origin stories with plenty of meta winks. _The Great Muppet Caper_ is the closest to the storybook movies in its conceit that Kermit, Fozzie, and Gonzo are obviously playing parts in a movie (and already know each other when the movie begins). But it still has the gang meeting and teaming up over the course of a narrative that's a pastiche of old movies, but not a specific remake. While the other two films don’t mention _The Muppet Show_ specifically, they both feel like they could be taking place prior to the creation of that program.

_The Muppet Christmas Carol_, the first film made after Jim Henson’s untimely 1990 death, is also chiefly responsible for the idea that Muppet movies feature an all-Muppet cast led by a single human. That’s not actually true. Like the others, _Christmas Carol_ has plenty of humans. It’s just that Michael Caine gives such a terrifically straight-faced performance in the lead as Ebeneezer Scrooge, opposite such a great variety of puppet characters, that it’s easy to forget about the other human actors entirely. _Muppet Treasure Island_ in turn plays like a sequel to _Christmas Carol_, repeating elements, sometimes to its detriment.

In _Muppet Treasure Island_, the faux-only human duties are split between two characters: Jim Hawkins, the young lead character of the Robert Louis Stevenson novel, and his mentor-turned-antagonist, the pirate Long John Silver. Initially, the filmmakers [planned](https://d23.com/muppet-treasure-island-did-you-know-2/) to turn Jim Hawkins into two characters played by Gonzo and Rizzo, reprising their double act from _Christmas Carol_. Ultimately, they decided it would make more sense to cast a genuine kid in the part, so Kevin Bishop would play Jim and Gonzo and Rizzo would be his sidekicks issuing commentary. This even more closely replicates _Christmas Carol_, where Gonzo plays a narrating Charles Dickens and Rizzo acts as his sidekick; they’re both constant (if unseen) companions to the main action. And as with the previous film, a beloved English actor would serve as a familiar face in an iconic role for _Muppet Treasure Island_, with Tim Curry playing Long John Silver.

    ![Long John Silver (Tim Curry) laughs as he brandishes a gun at Kermit and Piggy (who puts her head in her hands in distress/disgust) in a scene from Muppet Treasure Island](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/muppet-treasure-island-curry.jpg?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2)Image: Disney

These decisions made _Muppet Treasure Island_ the second Muppet movie in a row where, rather than Kermit, Piggy, Fozzie, and Gonzo serving as the most prominent characters, the foreground would be occupied by Gonzo, Rizzo, a variety of story-specific Muppets, and the human stars. In some ways, this increases the ambition and invention of both films, which continue Jim Henson’s tradition of pushing the boundaries of puppetry. In _Christmas Carol_, the experiments are more serious, with the eerily childlike Ghost of Christmas Past and the traditionally menacing Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come not much resembling traditional Muppets. In _Treasure Island_, the variations are more comic, with a delightful menagerie of animals, misshapen pirates, and assorted weirdos, plus some classic Muppets mixed into a few supporting roles and cameos. Because the Muppets rarely turn down opportunities to break the fourth wall, there’s a fun moment where talking vegetables muse about the awkward way the Swedish Chef has been shoehorned into a particular scene.

It’s weirder, though, that Kermit the Frog doesn’t make his entrance until nearly half an hour in, and Miss Piggy doesn’t turn up until even later. That’s not to say there can’t be a Muppet movie that doesn’t star Kermit and Piggy, but at this particular point, six years after Jim Henson’s death, it felt as if the filmmakers were still overcautious about using a post-Henson Kermit. Rather than showcasing Steve Whitmire as the new Kermit performer, they gave more screentime to his established character of Rizzo. Nothing against Rizzo — he is a [pioneer](https://www.eater.com/2019/9/17/20869131/ratataouille-muppets-take-manhattan-rat-chefs) in the field of rat-centric food prep — but the children (and neurotic adults) yearn for Kermit!

The ginger use of Kermit is one of several examples of how _Muppet Treasure Island_ catches both its characters and their then-temporary home of Disney at odd footing. Mere weeks after the release of _Muppet Treasure Island_, ABC would debut _Muppets Tonight_, a continuation of _The Muppet Show_ that featured a mix of old and new Muppets (and that also put Kermit in a more supporting role). Several [fan](https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/Johnny_Fiama) [favorites](https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/Big_Mean_Carl) (and obscure [oddities](https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Poodlepants)) would emerge from this show, but not in time to appear in _Muppet Treasure Island_, which makes the movie feel a little grab-baggier in retrospect (though a few _Treasure Island_ characters, like Polly the Lobster, subsequently appeared on the show, and plenty of _Muppets Tonight_ characters made it into later Muppet movies). Kermit and Piggy aren’t in it much, but it doesn’t boast Pepe the Prawn, Bobo the Bear, or even 1980s newbie Bean Bunny, either. A lot of it really is given over to the human actors.

On the Disney side of things, the film’s middling songs — not without their charms, but the worst batch of originals in any Muppet movie — feel of a piece with the Disney animation of the era, which was coming down from its early-’90s Ashman/Menken high, and fast. This isn’t Disney’s particular doing. An initial deal for the company to acquire the Muppets fell apart in the wake of Jim Henson’s death, and wouldn’t come [together again](https://www.toughpigs.com/disney-buys-the-muppets-20-years-later/) for another eight years after the release of _Muppet Treasure Island_, which it only distributed. But as a musical version of an oft-told story, it comes closer than any other Muppet movie to following the Disney animation template of that era. (Indeed, [_Treasure Planet_](https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/7/21/21319228/treasure-planet-disney-cast-characters-making-of-box-office-bombs-animation/) followed six years later, albeit sans production numbers. And in retrospect it’s a little surprising that the Muppets aren’t cracking [Pirates of the Caribbean](https://www.polygon.com/2020/8/6/21353264/pirates-of-the-caribbean-movies-disney-plus-news-reviews-cast-new-movies-order-essays/) jokes in this movie.)

Yet for some people, _Muppet Treasure Island_ is close enough to _Muppet Christmas Carol_ to feel meme-ably close to the Muppets’ whole deal. And it’s far from bad; it’s the Muppets doing pirate antics, so despite my carping it’s actually pretty fun. But 30 years on, _Muppet Treasure Island_ being arguably the weakest of the Muppets’ eight theatrical features serves as a reminder that making a great Muppet movie isn’t as simple as plugging the characters into a clear and obvious formula. No matter how often the internet circulates it, they’re too sweetly unruly for that strategy to work.
