Blizzard will celebrate the 30th anniversary of Diablo by adding the Warlock class to a swathe of games — including [Diablo 2: Resurrected](https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-ii-resurrected), more than 25 years after the game's original launch.

Resurrected, [the 2021 remaster of Blizzard's classic sequel](https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-2-resurrected-announced-for-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-ps4-xbox-one-and-nintendo-switch), will receive the Reign of the Warlock DLC today, February 11, priced at $24.99 across PC, PlayStation, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch. The paid add-on is available already on Battle.net — and on Steam, where Diablo 2: Resurrected has also launched.

The news was announced just moments ago at Blizzard's Diablo Anniversary Spotlight showcase, which featured Warlock-flavored reveals for the franchise's other games, too. A Warlock class will arrive as part of [Diablo 4: Lord of Hatred](https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv) on April 28, across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, before dropping in the free-to-play [Diablo Immortal](https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-immortal) this summer.

But it's the addition to Diablo 2: Resurrected that comes as the biggest surprise — since the class was never available in the original game. As of today, however, you'll be able to summon demons (including the suitably devilish-sounding Goatman, the Tainted and the Defiler), then bind and even devour them to gobble up their lifeforce, granting temporary buffs and traits.

Today's Diablo 2: Resurrected update also adds enhanced Terror Zones, where you can earn consumables and choose which acts are terrorized. On Hell difficulty you'll encounter the stalker enemies Heralds of Terror, though also have the ability to unveil five mystical statues to unlock an uber boss — the Colossal Ancients — which Blizzard describes as "the next evolution of endgame battles."

Lastly, today's update also adds a sprinkling of quality-of-life updates too, including built-in loot filters, improved stash tabs (yes, including stacking!), and a Chronicle to track the items you've collected.

Blizzard launched Diablo 2: Resurrected more than five years ago for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch. The game "brings a beloved classic up today's graphical standards, but it overlooks 20 years of obvious flaws," IGN wrote in our [Diablo 2: Resurrected review](https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-2-resurrected-review), awarding the game 7/10.
