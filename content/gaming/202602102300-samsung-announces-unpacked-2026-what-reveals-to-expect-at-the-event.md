Samsung announced its annual Unpacked event will take place on Wednesday, February 25 in San Francisco, where the company will be unveiling its next-generation S-series [phones](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-smartphone).

Now, Samsung hasn't come out and said exactly which phones will be announced, but it didn't leave much to the imagination. The company said the "new Galaxy S Series is coming," which sure makes it seem like it will be the usual affair of the Galaxy S26, S26 Plus and S26 Ultra.

There will likely be one or two extra devices making their way to the stage in San Francisco, so if you want to find out what reveals to expect and how to watch the event live, you can find out the details below.

## How to Watch Samsung Galaxy Unpacked

If you want to watch along, Samsung will be streaming Unpacked live on Wednesday, February 25, 2026 at 10AM PT / 1PM ET on [Samsung's website](https://www.samsung.com/us/). IGN will also be covering the event from San Francisco, so be sure to stay tuned for our coverage.

## What to Expect From Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2026

While this year's Unpacked event is happening a little later than it usually would be, it's still the one we would expect at the start of the year. So, you can expect the full lineup of non-foldable flagship phones: the Samsung Galaxy S26, S26 Plus and S26 Ultra.

It's possible that Samsung also follows up on the [Galaxy S25 Edge](https://www.ign.com/articles/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review) that came out in the middle of 2025, but leaks obtained by [9to5Google](https://9to5google.com/2025/10/16/the-galaxy-s25-edge-failed-so-badly-that-samsung-might-give-up-on-thin-phones/) suggest that phone was a failure and will be quietly killed off. Still, it's always possible that Samsung comes out with another... experimental smartphone this year.

What is likely, though, is that Samsung will release new earbuds. After all, the Galaxy Buds 3 came out in 2024, and there were some design leaks that came out late last year via [Android Authority](https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-4-look-3621013/). However, it's important to note that the Galaxy Buds 3 were revealed at Samsung's summer event, along with the [Galaxy Z Fold 6](https://www.ign.com/articles/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review) and Z Flip 6 – so we might have to wait a few months for the new earbuds.

Either way, it's only a few weeks before Unpacked 2026, so we don't have to wait long to see what the company has in store.
