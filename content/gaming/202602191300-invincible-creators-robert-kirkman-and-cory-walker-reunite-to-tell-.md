Invincible creators Robert Kirkman and Cory Walker are reuniting for a new story set in this popular superhero universe. The two are working to tell the origin story of Ella Mental, a new character making her debut in the fighting game Invincible VS.

This origin story will be published as a recurring backup feature in the pages of Capes, a Skybound series also set in the Invincible Universe. Currently, Skybound is republishing the original six issues of Kirkman and Mark Englehert's Capes as a remastered series. Beginning in Capes #7, co-writer Benito Cereno will join the series as it begins exploring new storylines, and Kirkman and Walker will kick off their Ella Mental backup story.

As mentioned, [Ella Mental is a new Invincible Universe character](https://www.ign.com/articles/shes-going-to-be-a-pivotal-part-of-the-story-invincible-vs-has-a-completely-original-fighter-just-for-the-game) making her debut in Invincible VS (which releases on April 30). Ella is a heroine with the ability to control the four elements - air, fire, earth, and water.

“I’m so excited Capes is continuing to tell stories set in the Invincible Universe but why not also GROW the Invincible Universe at the same time?!” said Kirkman in a statement. “It’s great to be working with Cory Walker again, creating a new character, in Ella Mental. You’ll love her in Invincible VS when that game launches, and you’ll get to read her origin story in Capes. How cool is that? I plan to be creating characters with Cory Walker forever!”

“Thrilled to team up with Robert one last time to bring an original character to life,” added Walker.
