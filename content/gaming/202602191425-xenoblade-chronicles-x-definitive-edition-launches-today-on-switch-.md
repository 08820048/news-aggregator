A Switch 2 version of [Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition](https://www.ign.com/games/xenoblade-chronicles-x) has been announced and simultaneously released by Nintendo, with a $4.99 upgrade fee for existing Switch owners.

This upgraded edition of the Nintendo role-player adds 4K/60fps support in TV mode, or 1080p/60fps action when playing on Switch 2 in handheld. It doesn't look like any other changes have been made.

If you don't own the game already, digital copies of the Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition — Switch 2 Edition are available to buy now separately from the eShop. Alternatively, a physical release is coming on April 16.

Originally released for Wii U back in 2015, Xenoblade Chronicles X was one of the many games from Nintendo's failed former console to get a new lease of life on Switch, with additional story content and character. Now, this Switch version has made the jump forward to a further console generation, although other than a visual polish, everything else sounds similar.

"The year is 2054 and Earth has been destroyed," reads a blurb for the game. "A colony ship of human survivors — including your customisable main character — has narrowly escaped the devastation and crashes on the mysterious planet Mira. Trek across a massive, dangerous world and fight for humanity’s future in this sci-fi RPG. Immerse yourself in an action-packed battle system with a variety of special attacks and skills to employ, enemies of all shapes and sizes to take down and more. You can even pilot a Skell that can fly, transform into a vehicle and wield immense strength in combat – if you can prove yourself to the BLADE organisation, first."

If you've not played a Xenoblade Chronicles game, X is a pretty standalone entry into Monolith Soft's RPG series — and also pretty well received. "Xenoblade Chronicles X was already one of the Wii U’s best games, and this Definitive Edition does more than enough to justify another trip to planet Mira," IGN wrote in our [review of the game's Switch port](https://www.ign.com/games/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition), awarding it 9/10.
