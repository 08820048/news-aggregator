Every car needs both a jump starter and tire inflator as part of its emergency kit, so why not just get both in one package. Starting today, Amazon is offering the [AstroAI S8 Air 3000A Cordless Jump Starter with Air Compressor (Tire Inflator)](https://zdcs.link/aA8Vm0?object_uuid=96144d0f-10be-4e74-a83c-d58e0257f128&t=article) for just $34.80 after you apply coupon code "**OXOVKD4Y**". AstroAI is a well-known brand and its products are higher quality than other similarly priced jump starters and air compressors you'll find on Amazon. I myself use an AstroAI S8 series jump starter; I've used it more than once on my 2018 Toyota Rav 4 and it has worked perfectly every time.

### AstroAI S8 Air Cordless 3000A Jump Starter with Air Compressor

The AstroAI S8 Air is a 3-in-1 device. First is a 12V cordless car jump starter that can supply 3,000A of peak power. The internal lithium battery has enough juice to jump start up to a 9L gas or 6.5L diesel engine up to 20 times on a single charge. Cordless jump starters essentially make traditional jumper cables obsolete for most people, since you no longer need the assistance of someone else's car (or a tow truck) to get you back on the road.

Second is the 150PSI cordless tire inflator and air compressor, which can refill a 195/65 R15 tire from 28 to 36 PSI in just under one minute. If you're using it to fix a flat, sure you have a [tire patch kit](https://zdcs.link/QGrBVK?object_uuid=96144d0f-10be-4e74-a83c-d58e0257f128&t=article) on seal the hole afterwards. Like most tire inflators, this model can also be used to inflate other things like bicycle tires, balls, inflatables, and more.

Lastly, the AstroAI S8 Air's internal 10,000mAh power bank can be used to charge up your dead iPhone or smartphone when you need it the most since it has both USB Type-A and USB Type-C ports.
