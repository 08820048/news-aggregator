It's no secret that [_Highguard_](https://www.polygon.com/highguard/) had a [seriously rocky launch](https://www.polygon.com/highguard-launch-rocky-start/). What had been a secret — until today — is where the struggling "raid shooter" got its funding. The game's developer and publisher, Wildlight Entertainment, has repeatedly referred to the game as "fully funded," but never disclosed that a majority of that funding came from China's gaming powerhouse Tencent. According to anonymous sources who spoke to [GameFile](https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-highguard-wildlight-entertainment) journalist Stephen Totilo, Tencent was the game's biggest financial backer.

Tencent is the world's largest video game company, with a massive investment portfolio including games like _PUBG Mobile_ and _League of Legends._ It also holds stakes in a number of international gaming companies, including Epic Games, Ubisoft, [and many more](https://www.pcgamer.com/every-game-company-that-tencent-has-invested-in/). Per anonymous sources familiar with the arrangement, TenCent's TiMi studio group was responsible for backing _Highguard_'s development. The reason for the secrecy regarding the arrangement is unclear, and it's not known exactly how much TiMi contributed to the project, though Totilo's sources indicate it was a significant amount of funding.

_Highguard_ was [first announced via a trailer](https://www.polygon.com/highguard-trailer-tgas-2025-last-reveal/) during the finale of [2025's The Game Awards](https://www.polygon.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-winners/), a spot which Wildlight says was [offered to the studio for free](https://www.polygon.com/highguard-the-game-awards-tga-shadowdrop-plans/) by host and creator Geoff Keighley. Keighley appeared to be quite excited about the upcoming game, which he [personally playtested](https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/2021773456959045662). Tencent senior vice president Steven Ma is a member of [The Game Awards' advisory board](https://thegameawards.com/about).

Neither Wildlight Entertainment nor Tencent have disclosed the partnership publicly, and while we don't know exactly how much it cost to make _Highguard_, one can imagine it wasn't cheap. The game launched with [extensive plans](https://www.polygon.com/highguard-roadmap-apex-legends-live-service-plan/) for future seasons, [beautifully animated lore cinematics](https://www.polygon.com/highguard-apex-legends-lore-videos/), and seemed poised to continue [rolling out updates](https://www.polygon.com/highguard-update-episode-2-warden-ekon-patch-notes/) despite largely negative reception from players. Wildlight has two physical locations, one in LA, another in Seattle. Until [recent layoffs reduced it to a skeleton crew](https://www.polygon.com/highguard-developer-wildlight-entertainment-layoffs/) of developers, the studio had about 100 employees, many of whom were former Respawn Entertainment developers. It's unclear if Tencent played a part in the studio's decision to lay off so many employees so soon after launch. Earlier today, _Highguard_‘s official website appeared to have been [taken offline](https://kotaku.com/highguard-website-down-shutting-down-servers-free-to-play-shooter-steam-playercount-2000669734).

Reps from Wildlight Entertainment did not respond to Polygon's request for comment.
