[Magic: The Gathering](https://www.ign.com/games/magic-the-gathering-trading-card-game) packs come in a few shapes and sizes (we covered the excellent Jumpstart Boosters for the [Avatar: The Last Airbender](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-avatar-the-last-airbender-where-to-buy-updated) set recently), but Collector Boosters are the most expensive.

Now, though, Amazon not only has Avatar Collector Boosters in stock, but it’s selling a box of 12 at a discount with a [16% saving off the list price](https://zdcs.link/aX4D3O?object_uuid=56c2fe2b-776b-4c5b-8bb2-793527ddc5e9&t=article).

### Avatar Collector Booster Box

## Avatar Collector Boosters Are On Sale At Amazon

That brings a Collector Booster box down to $384.62 from $455.88. It’s still super expensive, but it’s admittedly slightly easier to swallow.

It drops the price per pack from $37.99 to $32.05, which is a steep enough drop to almost pay for a whole Play Booster with the money you save - imagine that.

So, what’s the deal with Collector Boosters? Why does a box of 12 command a fee of over $450 when Play Boosters can be had much cheaper?

In truth, it’s because the [most valuable cards from the Avatar: The Last Airbender set](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-avatar-the-last-airbender-most-expensive-cards) are much, much more likely to be found in Collector Boosters. They contain all manner of special art treatments, including those controversial ‘Source Material’ full-art cards (no, we still can’t love them either).

The cards remain functionally the same as buying Play Boosters, but as the name suggests, these ones are aimed at collectors of Avatar superfans. We don't often give advice, but if you do buy them, please try and put them in a sleeve to keep them in the best condition possible!
