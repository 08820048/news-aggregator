A NECA figure of a Fortnite skin of Michael Myers from Halloween 2. That's a thing now.

## I'm obsessed with Fortnite's ridiculous new action figures

When someone who's not a gamer finds out how much time I’ve spent playing [_Fortnite_](https://www.polygon.com/game/fortnite/2417/), they inevitably ask what the draw is. And while I've cycled through a long list of reasons over the years, it always comes back to a core truth: _Fortnite_ is a digital toybox filled with my favorite digital action figures. So now that NECA is turning those digital figures into _actual_ action figures, I don't know what to do.

At the annual Toy Fair in New York on Feb. 14, collectible toy company NECA revealed its partnership with [Epic Games](https://www.polygon.com/epic-games-store-egs-update-avatars-voice-chat/) for a line of _Fortnite_ action figures, each of which comes with a digital code for use in the game. Polygon has reached out to Epic Games for more information on what the code will unlock and will update the story if we hear back.

Let's be clear: There are already [_plenty_ of _Fortnite_ toys](https://www.polygon.com/23940369/fortnite-gifts-best-books-games/) you can already buy, from [Lego](https://www.polygon.com/tag/lego/) sets to Peely figures to Nerf guns. NECA is going one step further, though. The company is producing action figures of established characters, as they appear in the game.

At this point, _Fortnite_ crossovers keep the game moving forward as beloved fictional characters and non-fictional humans arrive at a steady pace, adding more and more digital figures to my toybox (rumor has it that [_Solo Leveling_ is headed our way soon](https://www.polygon.com/fortnite-solo-leveling-collab-release-date-skins/)). But what the hell am I supposed to do with _physical_ figures of those _digital_ figures?

It doesn't matter, because I want them. When I first got a text from a friend about these, the very idea smacked of being a crass cash grab. Then I saw them. And, while I'm not prepared to say this _isn't_ a cash grab — of course, it is — I'm already opening my wallet to give NECA easier access. I mean, I won't be a completist with this line, but surely I should get figures of my regularly used skins, right? (Note: All of the announced figures are of cosmetics in my regular rotation; this is going to get expensive.)

To kick things off, NECA revealed its _Fortnite_ x Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles line, which launches with five figures — the four turtles and Shredder. The figures, which you can see above, are based on the _Fortnite_\-exclusive designs that have been featured in the shop as recently as December.

The figures capture the _Fortnite_ skins perfectly and would look excellent alongside any TMNT fan's NECA collection. And they're really putting my stance on _Fortnite_'s Ninja Turtles to the test. While I was previously a completist on the company's line of TMNT figures based on the live-action movies, that ended when they released a playset based on a [deleted scene from one of the movies](https://store.necaonline.com/products/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-ii-the-secret-of-the-ooze-shredders-throne). I don't have the spare room or money for something like that. And yet, here I am, figuring out if I should _just_ get Donatello or all four turtles. And if I get the four turtles, I should probably get Shredder too, right?

After all, there's plenty of room for this particular line of _Fortnite_ figures to grow, as there are definitely more cosmetics to pull from. Beyond these five, _Fortnite_ has previously released Splinter, April O'Neil, Casey Jones, Bebop, Rocksteady, Krang, and Super Shredder. And even if the line ended there, a complete _Fortnite_ x TMNT collection would look incredible on display.

Ninja Turtles fans aren't the only ones NECA is feeding well, though. The company also revealed a trio of horror icons, as interpreted in _Fortnite_. The first batch of _Fortnite_ horror figures includes _Halloween 2_'s Michael Myers (with emote keyboard), _Saw_'s Billy the Puppet, and _Texas Chain Saw Massacre_'s Leatherface with the skin of Peely as a back bling. Unlike the existing Ultimate NECA figures of these characters, the _Fortnite_ versions are more cartoony, with less detail. Also, just as he appears in _Fortnite_, Billy the Puppet is the same height as Michael and Leatherface — a horrifying thought that's bound to happen in a Saw movie someday.

Given how deep the rosters are for NECA's various action figure lines, there's bound to be a _lot_ more on the way in the coming months and years. If there can be _four_ different Casey Jones figures from the same 1990 _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_ movie — _another_ reason I stopped collecting that line — there are no guardrails for _Fortnite_. We could, somehow, end up with three different Michael Scott figures based on [_Fortnite's_ crossover with _The Office_](https://www.polygon.com/fortnite-the-office-skins-emotes-bundle-release-date/). So whatever happens, make sure you're purchasing carefully, or you'll share my fate: looking at a pile of action figure boxes in the closet that I simply don't have space for, wondering how I got here… before opting to just play _Fortnite_ instead.
