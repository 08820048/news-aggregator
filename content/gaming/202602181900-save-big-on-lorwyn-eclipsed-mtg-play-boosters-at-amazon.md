[Magic: The Gathering](https://www.ign.com/games/magic-the-gathering-trading-card-game) is on the verge of a [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles set](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-where-to-buy-updated-2026) next month, but don’t forget Lorwyn Eclipsed, a fantastic set that deserves plenty of love.

Now, the current set’s Play Booster Box has been discounted again, reaching ever-so-slightly lower than [the deal we spotted a few weeks ago](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gatherings-lorwyn-eclipsed-booster-box-is-already-discounted). Amazon is currently offering a 22% discount on the box, [bringing it to $128.94](https://zdcs.link/QPxyLA?object_uuid=1a81e52d-402f-4f50-a134-3f4ba0931b4b&t=article). That’s close to its lowest-ever price of $125.

## Lorwyn Eclipsed Play Boosters Are Close To Their Best-Ever Price

That’s a sizeable price cut on the $164.70 list price. It means the $5.49 price of each pack drops to around $4.30.

As for the set itself, Lorwyn Eclipsed is fantastic, bringing back fan-favorite creature types and a classic location that puts the Magic back in Magic, as strange as that may sound to outsiders.

As the first Universes Within set of 2026, [it’s packed with amazing chase cards](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-lorwyn-eclipsed-most-expensive-cards) - although you’ll no doubt have better luck finding them with the eye-wateringly expensive Collector Boosters.

Still, from Kithkin to Giants, there’s a whimsicality to the set not seen since maybe Bloomburrow, and after Avatar and Spider-Man sets, we’re glad to be back on familiar ground. It doesn't hurt that the two new preconstructed Commander Decks, [Blight Curse and Dance of the Elements](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-lorwyn-eclipsed-precon-decks-in-stock-best-price-preview), are fantastically well-constructed, too.

As someone that's been playing Magic for around three or four years, it's probably one of my favorite sets in a little while.
