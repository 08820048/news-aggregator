"Grade A" Refurbished

### Apple Watch Ultra Smartwatch

Includes 1 year Woot warranty

The Apple Watch Ultra features a titanium case that's more rugged and corrosion resistant than the softer aluminum or stainless steel casing found in the less expensive Apple Watches. Pure titanium, not titanium "coated" metal, is considerably more expensive and is one of the main reasons for the Ultra's steep price tag. This is also a larger watch with a 49mm case size compared to 42mm-46mm for the Series 11 so it looks more substantial on your wrist.

The Apple Watch Ultra boasts a 1.92" Retina LTPO OLED display with up to 2,000 nits of brightness. It's protected by a scratch resistant sapphire crystal face. Other features include an S8 processor with 32GB of storage, dual-frequency GPS, beam-forming triple microphone array, dual speakers, up to 36 hours of battery life, 100m of water resistance, customizable physical action button, and a built-in Oceanic+ app that literally puts a dive computer on your wrist.
