[KPop Demon Hunters](https://www.ign.com/movies/kpop-demon-hunters) voice actor Kevin Woo has exclusively revealed a new [Dead By Daylight](https://www.ign.com/games/dead-by-daylight) Survivor to IGN — for which he'll be providing the voice, if not his singing talents.

If you've watched or sung along to the animated Netflix phenomenon, you'll have heard Woo as the singing voice of Mystery (the boyband member with purple hair over his eyes).

"I personally think as a Killer, Mystery Saja would thrive on psychological manipulation rather than brute aggression," Woo said Woo, who's set to star in a brand new chapter for the horror game, All-Kill:Comeback.

Here, he plays Kwon Tae-young, a tech designer Survivor hired to work on a virtual idol. Players will be able to check him out in a Public Test Build that will go [live on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/381210/Dead_by_Daylight/) tomorrow, on February 24.

"I focused on making every breath, every strained scream, and every moment of fear feel grounded"“

Woo previously worked on Dead By Daylight as a consultant on its previous K-pop storyline, which introduced the sociopathic idol the Trickster.

"Transitioning from consultant to fully embodying a character through voice was both surreal and deeply fulfilling," Woo said. "As a consultant on the original chapter, I was involved in shaping the Trickster’s emotional identity — his ego, his obsession with artistry, and the narcissistic rage simmering beneath his polished idol exterior.

"Stepping into Kwon Tae-young’s perspective in this new release allowed me to approach the world of Dead by Daylight from the other side of that mythology. Because I understood the Trickster’s lore so intimately, his betrayal, his fixation on control, and his warped perception of performance. I was able to layer that history into Kwon Tae-young’s fear and internal conflict."

Woo is the perfect person to act as a consultant on the world of K-pop. He performed as part of the line up for K-pop bands XING and U-KISS, and recently announced he was part of a new subunit of U-KISS with bandmates Hoon and Kiseop. But how did his bandmates feel after his consultant work on the role of a killer K-pop idol?

"The irony is that while Ji-Woon Hak’s lore in Dead by Daylight explores betrayal and ego within a band dynamic, my real-life band experience was built on camaraderie and growth. That contrast actually helped me understand the tragedy of the Trickster even more," he revealed.

"They mostly praised me about becoming a 'global Hollywood superstar' after KPop Demon Hunters. It was flattering — but I reminded them that none of this exists without our shared experience as global idols that paved the way for K-pop."

Since Woo first worked on the game in 2021 the world of K-pop has grown to be a much bigger force in the world of global entertainment, in no small part thanks to the incredible success of the Netflix movie KPop Demon Hunters, which first aired last year. Woo explained how his work on that project helped him embody the character of Kwon Tae-young in All-Kill: Comeback.

"Voice acting for KPop Demon Hunters deepened my appreciation for how much storytelling can be communicated purely through tone, breath control, and texture. Without physical performance to rely on, your voice becomes the entire emotional instrument. In a game like Dead by Daylight, that responsibility is amplified," he explained.

"As a consultant, I wanted to ensure that the cultural references remained authentic. As a voice actor, I focused on making every breath, every strained scream, and every moment of fear feel grounded within the brutal, high-stakes environment of the Entity’s realm."

He also revealed that voicing a Dead By Daylight Survivor demanded a lot more of him than just reading a script.

"To authentically capture that experience, I had to embody exhaustion, adrenaline spikes, and sudden bursts of panic. I would run in place during takes to elevate my breathing. I rehearsed strained vocalizations that mimic being hooked, injured, or chased," he continued.

"Unlike polished K-pop tracks, which prioritize control and tonal perfection, horror voice work embraces imperfection, cracked screams, unstable breathing, and vocal strain. The chaos is the performance."

And Woo isn't just a consultant or a voice actor when it comes to Dead By Daylight, he's a player too.

"I gravitate toward a tactical Survivor play-style, focusing on stealth loops, careful map awareness, and team synergy," he said. "I’m usually the one prioritizing safe unhooks, body-blocking when necessary, and healing teammates in concealed areas."

Dead By Daylight was first released in 2016 and since then has introduced a steady and increasingly terrifying number of Killers and Survivors to the game, including characters from Stranger Things, Attack On Titan, Resident Evil and of course, [Nicolas Cage.](https://www.ign.com/articles/nicolas-cage-is-playing-himself-in-dead-by-daylight)
