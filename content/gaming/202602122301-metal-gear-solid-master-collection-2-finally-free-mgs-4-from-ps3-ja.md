Konami announced several new games during today's PlayStation State of Play stream. Notable among the list is _Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Volume 2_, a package that will include ports of both _[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots](https://www.polygon.com/game/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots/11583/)_ and _[Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker](https://www.polygon.com/game/metal-gear-solid-peace-walker/1942/)._ The collection launches on August 27.

While ports are a dime a dozen these days, _Master Collection 2_ is an unusually significant one. _Metal Gear Solid 4_ was originally released on PlayStation 3 and has never been ported to any other console. It's a big deal, considering how notoriously difficult it is to get PS3 games working on modern consoles. _Peace Walker_, on the other hand, was a PSP release that was previously given an HD remaster as part of the _Metal Gear Solid HD Collection_. (That's not to be confused with the Master Collection.)

The package follows 2023's [_Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Volume 1_](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23939010/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1-review-scripts-lore/), which included both the original Metal Gear games and the first three Metal Gear Solid games. Volume 2 is a bit light by comparison; it only features two games and is missing _Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain_.

To celebrate the announcement, _Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater_ is currently on sale. You can get it for [$35 on Steam currently](https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/2417610/). Konami showed off several other games during the State of Play, including _Silent Hill Townfall_ and a new Castlevania game from Motion Twin.

_Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Volume 2_ launches on August 27.
