Finding the **best weapons** in _Romeo Is a Dead Man_ is important, as you won't have enough resources to upgrade them all. While there are only four melee weapons and four ranged weapons to choose from, each weapon comes with a unique playstyle. Should you go for a flashy katana or a high-impact shotty?

Here's how to find the best weapons in _Romeo Is a Dead Man_ for you.

## Best melee weapons in Romeo Is a Dead Man

To find the best melee weapon, it's important to compare its general strength (attack power), its ability to stagger the opponent (break ability), the strength of the Bloody Summer ultimate attack, and its blood generation (needed to charge Bloody Summer). You can unlock new weapons and upgrade them in the tool room on the Last Night, which requires Emerald Flowsion and Sentrey, respectively. Without extensive grinding, you won't gather enough Sentrey to upgrade every weapon to the max within one playthrough, so it's best to pick a favorite weapon early.

This overview includes the weapon stats at upgrade level 12, with each individual stat at level 3.

**Name**

**Stats at lvl 12**

**Strengths and weaknesses**

Spazer (katana)

-   Attack Power: 20
-   Break ability: 19
-   Bloody Summer: 195
-   Blood amount: 19

The Spazer is quick and highly mobile. Its attack power isn't the best, but it'll be easier to time your attacks compared to the Star Destroyer. Its main downside is the comparatively slow blood generation; since you'll likely want to use Bloody Summer as often as possible, this isn't the best weapon in _Romeo Is a Dead Man_.

Star Destroyer (broadsword)

-   Attack Power: 31
-   Break ability: 32
-   Bloody Summer: 213
-   Blood amount: 32

This massive sword deals devastating blows, but it's much slower than its peers, which makes it easier for enemies to interrupt your combos. That said, if you like a heavy-hitting sword with amazing stagger and knockback abilities, the Star Destroyer is the best weapon for you. Even a combo as simple as a heavy attack followed by a light attack will push enemies back.

Juggernaut (fists)

-   Attack Power: 19
-   Break ability: 18
-   Bloody Summer: 231
-   Blood amount: 18

This melee weapon is quick, but its range and break ability are lacking. While the Juggernaut's dodge attacks and combos often end with a kick, the pushback is quite weak compared to a weapon like Star Destroyer. Also, despite what the stats say, the Juggernaut's Bloody Summer attack doesn't have much impact (again, partly due to a limited range).

Arcadia (spear)

-   Attack Power: 29
-   Break ability: 29
-   Bloody Summer: 204
-   Blood amount: 29

This weapon has a bit of everything; it's fast, has good range, a strong Bloody Summer attack, and a decent break ability. Most importantly, however, the Arcadia comes with quick blood generation, so you can use your Bloody Summer attacks more often.

Based on this overview, the **Arcadia** spear is the **best melee weapon** in _Romeo Is a Dead Man_. Although attack power and speed are important, a quick blood buildup and a strong Bloody Summer attack are even more so; with the Arcadia in hand, you're sure to use Bloody Summer often.

## Best ranged weapons in Romeo Is a Dead Man

Just like melee weapons, you must compare each ranged weapon's stats, from general attack power to blood generation, to find the best option for you. Again, this list includes all weapon stats at level 12 (with each individual stat upgraded to level 3).

**Name**

**Stats at lvl 12**

**Strengths and weaknesses**

Discovery (pistol)

-   Attack Power: 14
-   Break ability: 13
-   Bloody Summer: 146
-   Blood amount: 13

This little pistol is amazing. It's highly precise, even at high range, and it's powerful enough to destroy weak points in just a few shots. With nine bullets in the magazine, you may not even have to reload, but if you do, it's much faster than the other ranged weapons. Without spread or explosive impact, Discovery isn't good against crowds, but you can use your melee weapon for that.

Diaspora (shotgun)

-   Attack Power: 7
-   Break ability: 11
-   Bloody Summer: 36
-   Blood amount: 11

Thanks to its bullet spread, this weapon is absolutely devastating in close-quarters combat, especially against enemy groups. However, it's hard to hit faraway targets, and since some of your enemies are equipped with sniper rifles, it may be more useful to level a weapon with a higher range.

Nebuchadnezzar (machine gun)

-   Attack Power: 5
-   Break ability: 3
-   Bloody Summer: 12
-   Blood amount: 3

Unleashing this machine gun on troops of common rotters is highly efficient, but the Nebuchadnezzar lacks the strength to destroy weak points with ease. At mid-range, the bullet spread is way too heavy to hit precise targets, making weak point destruction nearly impossible. If you enjoy automatic weapons, this could work for you, but it's not the best choice for your ranged weapon in _Romeo Is a Dead Man_.

Yggdrasil (cannon)

-   Attack Power: 103
-   Break ability: 56
-   Bloody Summer: 183
-   Blood amount: 56

The Yggdrasil grenade launcher may look very intimidating compared to a pistol, but beware; it's only good against groups of minor enemies. And even then, the grenade's area of impact isn't big enough to wipe the floor, and it takes ages to reload. It'll be very hard to hit weak points on bosses with this weapon as it typically requires range and precision, so this isn't the best choice as your first ranged weapon in _Romeo Is a Dead Man_.

Based on this comparison, the **Discovery** takes the crown; this is the **best ranged weapon** in _Romeo Is a Dead Man_ if you wish to hit weak points reliably. Since you can deal with enemies within melee range just fine using a blade, it's best to level a ranged weapon capable of staggering bosses from a distance; a few well-aimed bullets from the Discovery pistol will do that for you.
