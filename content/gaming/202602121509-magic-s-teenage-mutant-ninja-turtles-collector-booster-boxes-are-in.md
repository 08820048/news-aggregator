[Magic: The Gathering](https://www.ign.com/games/magic-the-gathering-trading-card-game) is kicking off its [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-where-to-buy-2026) set in a few weeks, and while we’ve seen plenty of deals on upcoming sets, Collector Boosters have been like gold dust… until now.

[Amazon is offering a box of 12 Collector boosters for $449.99](https://zdcs.link/QOjGdY?object_uuid=b0dcedeb-37e8-42b2-9002-a01f70bed4f2&t=article), but you’ll need to act swifter than one of the titular turtles to grab one.

How much?! That’s right, the fee is high. The reason for this is that Collector Boosters are the best way of grabbing the most expensive cards in any given Magic: The Gathering set because they’re full of alternative art treatments and foil variants.

The rub in this instance is that we don’t know what the most valuable cards in the set are going to be because Wizards of the Coast hasn’t started card reveals outside of a handful just yet.

If you want to snag some great Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cards for your Magic: The Gathering collection, this is the way to go, but with the $37 per pack around the same price you’d pay anywhere, don’t expect any discounts.

Honestly, in the time it’s taken us to write this article, there’s a good chance a bunch more of these have been sold, and they’re not likely to be reprinted after the fact, either.

As a reminder, Collector Boosters don't necessarily contain 'better' cards than Play Boosters, they just contain rarer versions. If you're looking for cards to play with, [you can grab a bundle at a discount right now](https://zdcs.link/z3OvwE?object_uuid=b0dcedeb-37e8-42b2-9002-a01f70bed4f2&t=article).
