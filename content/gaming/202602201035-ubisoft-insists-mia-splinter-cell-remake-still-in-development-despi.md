Ubisoft has said its long-awaited [Splinter Cell remake](https://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-remake) remains in development despite layoffs at the studio working on the project.

40 jobs will be lost at Ubisoft Toronto, the company has now announced, as part of the ongoing push to cut costs that has seen thousands of employees depart over the past few years. In a statement sent to IGN, Ubisoft said that work on Splinter Cell was unaffected by the redundancies.

The company announced plans to remake the original Splinter Cell using The Division's snazzy Snowdrop engine back in December 2021, though little has been heard of it since.

"Following the recent announcement of the final phase of Ubisoft's global cost-savings plan and the discontinuation of projects, Ubisoft Toronto will be reducing its workforce by 40 roles," a Ubisoft spokesperson said.

"This decision was not taken lightly and does not in any way reflect the talent, dedication, or contributions of the individuals affected. Our priority now is to support them through this transition with comprehensive severance packages and robust career placement assistance. 

"The Toronto studio continues development on the Splinter Cell game and serves as a co-development partner on Rainbow Six, along with supporting additional co-development projects."

The suggestion here is that Toronto was working on one of the six games that [Ubisoft canned last month](https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-6-projects-including-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-closes-2-studios-and-confirms-further-layoffs-in-major-company-restructure), including its [Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake](https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-6-projects-including-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-closes-2-studios-and-confirms-further-layoffs-in-major-company-restructure). At the time, the company also confirmed the full closures of Ubisoft Stockholm and Ubisoft Halifax, and "restructurings" of staff at Ubisoft offices in Abu Dhabi, Trials studio RedLynx and at Massive, home to The Division. A week later, Ubisoft then announced [plans to lose up to 200 jobs at its headquarters in Paris](https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-follows-last-weeks-game-cancelations-and-studio-closures-with-a-proposed-reduction-of-200-more-jobs-at-its-paris-headquarters) — a decision that has [since been the subject of employee protests](https://za.ign.com/assassins-creed-shadows/225554/news/union-says-1200-ubisoft-staff-went-on-strike-this-week-protesting-closures-cost-cutting-and-return-t).

As for the Splinter Cell remake, the project remains firmly under wraps without any kind of release window. Still, some positive news emerged late last year — when the [remake's original director David Grivel announced he had returned](https://www.ign.com/articles/splinter-cell-remakes-original-director-returns-to-the-project-after-leaving-in-2022) to recommence his role [after leaving Ubisoft in 2022](https://www.ign.com/articles/splinter-cell-remake-director-leaves-ubisoft). Here's hoping more emerges from the shadows soon.
