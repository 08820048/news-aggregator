PlayStation’s Direct store is holding [a sizeable sale on PS5 games](https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-launches-a-brand-new-promotional-sale-on-ps5-games-accessories-and-more), controllers, and even consoles, but there’s an added incentive for fans of Hideo Kojima’s Death Stranding 2: On the Beach.

The game is (for the time being), a PS5 exclusive, and marked one of 2025’s biggest releases on PS5, and you can snag its [limited edition DualSense at a $20 discount right now](https://zdcs.link/Qm825n?object_uuid=490b96db-0169-4b15-a6b5-fdb089a03464&t=article).

The pad itself isn’t exactly subtle. It’s the classic black DualSense with a big Drawbridge logo on the touchpad and decals on the grips, but it’s pretty slick if we do say so. There’s also some detailing around the symbol buttons, which is a nice touch, making them look connected.

It includes a digital version of the game, along with a 15-inch Magellan Man Statue and an adorable/creepy (depending on your point of view) 3-inch Dollman figure you can attach to your keys or backpack.

[In our review](https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review), Simon Cardy said the game delivers on the promise of the divisive original, awarding it a 9 out of 10.

“It removes almost all of the friction that weighed down its rookie effort, delighting with a truly unpredictable story full of intrigue and malleable stealth-action playgrounds hidden in its vast, hauntingly beautiful version of Australia.”
