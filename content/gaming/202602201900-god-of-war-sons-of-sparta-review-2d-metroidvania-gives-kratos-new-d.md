While it doesn't innovate on the Metroidvania genre, Sons of Sparta is a worthwhile addition to God of War canon

## The new God of War turns Kratos into a YA protagonist with some growing pains

Recent PlayStation adopters likely know God of War’s Kratos best as the “BOI!”-yelling, axe-throwing, bearded father of the PlayStation 4 and PS5’s Norse Saga games. 2018’s [_God of War_](https://www.polygon.com/game/god-of-war/1080/) and its 2022 sequel, [_Ragnarök_](https://www.polygon.com/game/god-of-war-ragnarok/40817/), took the rage-fueled protagonist of nearly a decade’s worth of bloody, hack-and-slash titles and turned him into a somber figure. He’s a sensitive guy who is trying to learn how to be a better father to Atreus while navigating the grief of losing his wife, Faye. The latest God of War game does something similar: _God of War Sons of Sparta_ turns Kratos into the protagonist of a young adult novel. He takes center stage in a coming-of-age journey that once again reinvents the character to fit the story the game wants to tell.

Before he was slaying the Greek or Norse pantheon of Gods, Kratos was just a boi training to be a Spartan. The 2D Metroidvania _Sons of Sparta_, developed by indie studio Mega Cat rather than Sony’s Santa Monica Studio, finds him side-stepping his training and chores as he, along with his younger brother Deimos, venture into the wilds in search of a fellow Spartan who’s gone missing.

It’s a retro-styled, combat-heavy action-platformer. While a Metroidvania, _Sons of Sparta_ isn’t as maze-like as you might expect coming off of a _[Mio: Memories in Orbit](https://www.polygon.com/mio-memories-in-orbit-review/)_ or [_Hollow Knight Silksong_](https://www.polygon.com/silksong-review-hollow-knight-polygon-score-metacritic/), but it is sprawling. _Sons of Sparta_ looks and feels just like something I would have played on the Game Boy Advance over 20 years ago, and in a way is a bit stuck in time in that regard; aside from giving new dimension to Kratos, it doesn’t innovate with its gameplay, ultimately landing as a par-for-the-course Metroidvania made for the hardcore God of War fans. Though it may not be God of War’s most exciting installment, Mega Cat’s reinterpretation comes with surprising emotional depth that makes for a worthwhile prequel.

While out travelling, Kratos and Deimos come across clues as to where Vasilis, the missing Spartan, has been and what he’s been up to. Wooden carvings, an instrument, a recipe list. Seems like Vasilis is interested in anything _but_ being a part of the Spartan military, and Kratos and Deimos hold clashing views over this. The contrast between the brothers is the crux of _Sons of Sparta_ and what makes it sing. Kratos has fully bought into the Spartan way of life, while Deimos imagines a life outside of fighting. What’s so wrong with wanting to make music or poetry anyway? Kratos is set to leave Vasilis behind for what he perceives is Vasilis’ abandonment of Sparta, whereas Deimos argues that to leave one Spartan behind is to leave all of Sparta by the wayside.

Their conversations at campfires and out in the wilds consistently challenge Kratos’ views, forcing him to reckon with what he actually believes and what beliefs the Spartan military has indoctrinated in him. Every step is a crossroads for the future God killer, especially as other figures, like the sculptor Konstantinos, chide him for prioritizing an individual over the whole of Sparta. Then there’s a member of The Krypteia that somewhat scolds Kratos for looking out for his brother, arguing that favoring an individual weakens the whole of Sparta. Kid Kratos just can’t catch a break!

He grows tremendously over the course of _Sons of Sparta_, starting as someone who does not want to be searching for Vasilis _at all_ and ends as someone who chooses to continue looking for his Spartan brother, despite his superiors essentially telling him not to. In the game’s present narrative, an older Kratos relays this story to his daughter Calliope and imparts wisdom upon her about one’s duty to one’s fellow people. (Those tender moments of Kratos speaking with Calliope almost make you forget the gruesome fate that’s about to befall them.) If nothing else, _Sons of Sparta_ builds on Santa Monica’s quest to add new layers to the God-slayer’s tortured soul.

In between all those talks of duty and clue-hunting are plenty of monsters to fight. On the surface, the gameplay appears simple, with just a spear for stabby stabs and a shield for defense. But as Kratos grows, so does his arsenal, with boons from the Gods allowing him to wield magic attacks and different spear parts adding various moves to his repertoire. I’d unleash a full combo of regular attacks on an enemy, dodge through them to avoid their slashes, whip out a Spartan skill on them (like an overhead slam from the air), and finish them off with a magic attack, like lobbing a magenta fireball. At a certain point, Kratos became a juggernaut on the battlefield, a preview of the God of War he’s to become.

You’ll need all those attacks against the game’s bosses, which range from fair and fun bouts to frustratingly drawn-out gauntlets. _Sons of Sparta_ has the occasional odd difficulty spike. I only needed a couple of tries to defeat a Stymphalian bird, but the demon made of blood and ichor Alastor induced a Kratos-like rage in me with how drawn-out the boss fight was. Though, _Sons of Sparta_ is more forgiving than other Metroidvanias; difficulty options ensure there will be no [Difficulty Discourse](https://www.polygon.com/silksong-difficulty-challenge-hollow-knight-easy-mode-hornet/) spinning out from this game.

As far as Metroidvanias go, _Sons of Sparta_ doesn’t necessarily want you to get lost. It’s not as focused on exploration as most other of its genre compatriots; its default settings leave a red objective marker on your map, guiding you along. It’s helpful in that often you’ll know the left path will lead you to the next step in the main story, whereas the right path will take you to something cool — an olive tree, a tough fight, treasure chests full of currency, or perhaps just a campsite to rest your weary bones. You can basically play it like a linear game (though you’ll still want to go out of the way for upgrades), or turn that objective marker off and go get explorin’ at your own pace.

_God of War Sons of Sparta_ doesn’t do anything new with the Metroidvania genre, but it _does_ do something new with the God of War himself. It shows off a side of Kratos we’re not used to, making him a young man who’s trying to decide what path to take next. (A fitting match for a sprawling Metroidvania, no?) After the bloody Greek trilogy and somber Norse Saga, the Kratos who’s just trying to find his way contrasts well with the revenge-filled and grief-stricked versions we’ve gotten to know so well.
