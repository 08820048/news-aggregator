Daniel Vávra, director of the [Kingdom Come: Deliverance](https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii) franchise, is leaving game development to focus on making a Kingdom Come: Deliverance movie.

In an interview with Czech site [CzechCrunch](https://cc.cz/daniel-vavra-uz-nepracuje-pro-warhorse-studios-na-nove-hre-misto-toho-pripravuje-hrany-film-kingdom-come/) (via [VGC](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-director-daniel-vavra-is-stepping-away-from-game-development/)), studio head Martin Frývaldský revealed that Vávra was stepping away from developing Warhorse Studios' next game to focus on Kingdom Come: Deliverance's big-screen adaptation.

"Dan has a new role. That’s the creation of the Kingdom Come movie," Frývaldský said (via machine translation). "We have been moving the Kingdom Come brand away from video games for some time now. So far we have been in comics, concerts, and tourism, but the film has attracted us the most. That is why Dan and I are working on getting it onto the screen or the big screen. There is also a draft script."

"I'm sure people will wonder if this is some kind of breakup with Warhorse," he added, "No, on the contrary, Dan himself wanted to move on. He made three games that were a global success, he has been wanting to try something different for a long time. Getting Kingdom Come to the screen \[...\] in the next few years is another milestone that we want to achieve, and that is Dan's new role. You won't see him in the office every day anymore, but in a broader sense he is still part of Warhorse."

Asked for the latest on those plans to adapt Kingdom Come: Deliverance for the big screen, Frývaldský said: "For a long time, people were around us who would like to make a film of KCD, but then Covid came and everything fell asleep. Now, after the release of the second game, we have returned to the idea with much greater drive.

"We feel the interest from the film world, negotiations are already underway. We don't just want to sell the rights, we want the film to be what we imagine it to be."

Frývaldský suggested that Vávra's new job title could be something like transmedia director as the team pushes to expand the franchise beyond games.

The first Kingdom Come: Deliverance video game, released in 2018, was a smash hit, selling over 10 million copies. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 came out last year and has so far sold over 5 million copies.

[IGN's Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review returned a 9/10](https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review). We said: "Armed with excellent melee combat and an exceptional story, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is one part sequel and one part coronation, bringing a lot of the original's ideas to fruition."
