Amazon will no longer publish UK developer Maverick Games’ yet-to-be-titled open-world driving game, reports [The Game Business.](https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/amazon-abandons-its-open-world-driving)

“As part of our strategic evolution to focus on projects that leverage Amazon’s unique strengths and scale, including the recent re-launch of Luna and our Tomb Raider franchise partnership with Crystal Dynamics, we have decided to release Maverick Games from their publishing agreement with Amazon Game Studios,” the company explained in a provided statement.

“We have tremendous respect for the Maverick Games team and the compelling narrative-led driving experience they’re creating. This decision allows Maverick Games the flexibility to find a publishing partner whose strategic priorities are better aligned with bringing their game to market. We’re proud of what we accomplished together during our partnership and wish them every success in the future.”

Fortunately, this does not mean the end of the road for the project itself, with [Maverick Games co-founder Mike Brown confirming on social media](https://x.com/FlawlessC0wboy/status/2026643576575218055) that development is continuing to progress strongly and plans are in place to share information about the game later this year.

Maverick Games was founded in 2022 following the departure of a number of staff from Forza Horizon developer Playground Games. At that time, former Forza Horizon 5 creative director Mike Brown was joined by producer Tom Butcher, technical director Matt Craven, technical art director Gareth Harwood, audio director Fraser Stachan, and art director Ben Penrose. [It was revealed in January 2023](https://www.ign.com/articles/several-forza-horizon-developers-leave-playground-games-and-xbox-to-form-new-studio) that the team was working on a “premium open-world game for consoles and PC.”

Maverick Games, a new studio by veterans from Playground Games, is working on an open-world driving game.
