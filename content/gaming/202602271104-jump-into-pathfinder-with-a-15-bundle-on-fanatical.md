The [Dungeons & Dragons](https://www.polygon.com/dnd-dungeons-dragons/) 2024 ruleset was designed to [make it easier to get into the game](https://www.polygon.com/dnd-2024-review-first-year-dungeons-dragons/), and the release schedule since then has focused on starter sets and easy-to-run adventures. If that’s not what you’re looking for, now is a great time to try D&D’s biggest rival, [_Pathfinder_](https://www.polygon.com/2016/8/1/12317888/the-story-of-pathfinder-dungeons-and-dragons-most-popular-offspring/), thanks to a [Fanatical bundle](https://www.fanatical.com/en/bundle/introduction-to-pathfinder-2nd-edition-rpg-bundle) offering 26 key products for just $15.

Paizo launched _Pathfinder_ in 2009 to appeal to players who didn’t want to make the transition between D&D’s 3rd and 4th editions. While the original version was published using the Open Gaming License, Paizo changed things significantly in [_Pathfinder Second Edition_](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/8/1/20727563/pathfinder-2e-review-second-edition/) by introducing a new actions and feats system that brings a lot of choice to individual turns and character builds. Paizo [revised the rules again in 2023](https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/23965926/pathfinder-2e-remaster-ogl-controversy-player-core-gm-core-orc-release-date-price/) in response to Wizards’ [attempts to change the OGL](https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/23965926/pathfinder-2e-remaster-ogl-controversy-player-core-gm-core-orc-release-date-price/)_,_ stripping out any concepts too closely tied to D&D while also improving the layout of its books and updating classes based on player feedback.

Fanatical’s [Introduction to _Pathfinder 2nd Edition_ bundle](https://www.fanatical.com/en/bundle/introduction-to-pathfinder-2nd-edition-rpg-bundle) offers everything you need to play or run the highly tactical tabletop role-playing game. It includes both _Player Core_ books, the _GM Core_, and the _Monster Core_, plus several adventures designed for 1st-level characters like _The Fall of Plaguestone_ and _Abomination Vaults_. The package also includes books that add a huge variety of character options and help game masters flesh out their campaigns set in Paizo’s rich world of Golarion. The sale ends April 14.

Looking for more deals? Fanatical will be offering several bundles to celebrate International Game Master’s Day on March 4. Check back then for deals on [_Shadowdark_](https://www.polygon.com/24209789/ennie-award-winners-2024-shadowdark-eat-the-reich/), _Symbaroum_, [_Dungeon Crawl Classics_](https://www.polygon.com/dnd-alternative-dungeon-crawl-classics/), and more.
