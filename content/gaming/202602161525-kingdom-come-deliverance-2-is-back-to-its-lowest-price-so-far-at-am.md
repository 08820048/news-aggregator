For PlayStation users, Amazon's been an excellent place to scoop up some new video games recently thanks to its big [selection of discounted PS5 titles](https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-has-an-excellent-sale-on-select-ps5-games-today-updated). At the moment, [Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2](https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii) is among the many options on sale right now at the retailer, but it's not just its PS5 version that's dropped in price.

Both the [PS5](https://zdcs.link/QLpbY0?object_uuid=4169d95d-c567-43b7-9ddf-51f6e9508f93&t=article) and [Xbox Series X](https://zdcs.link/9yPLnO?object_uuid=4169d95d-c567-43b7-9ddf-51f6e9508f93&t=article) versions are on sale at Amazon for $29.99 (50% off) and $29.60 (51% off), respectively. If this RPG - which we even awarded as a runner-up nominee in our awards list of the [best RPGs of 2025](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-rpg-of-2025) - has been on your wishlist, now is your chance to grab it at a great low price.

This is a low price worth taking advantage of while it's still live, too. According to price tracker camelcamelcamel, the [PS5](https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0D2FGZ3HF) deal marks a return to its lowest price so far at the retailer, and it's a brand new low for the [Xbox Series X](https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0D2DW9FJK?tp=1y) version. No better time to grab it if you've been waiting for an exciting discount to appear.

As mentioned before, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 was among our [favorite RPGs of 2025](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-rpg-of-2025), earning a runner-up nomination on our awards list. IGN's Michael Higham said it's "an investment that pays back multiple times over in its 120-hour runtime. It’s a commitment - a slow-burn game you have to want to live in. But it’s also an action-packed cinematic adventure that proves to have an emotional range that the original didn’t."

Writer Leana Hafer's [review](https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review) at the time of release also said it's "Armed with excellent melee combat and an exceptional story," and called it "one part sequel and one part coronation, bringing a lot of the original's ideas to fruition." So why not add it to your library now while it's still on sale?
