_Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen_, the 2004 remakes of the original _Pokémon Red and Blue_ games, are coming to Nintendo Switch in one week, releasing on Friday Feb. 27, aka Pokémon Day. It will also be 30 years since the original games debuted in 1996.

The Pokémon Company announced its annual Pokémon Presents broadcast will be taking place on the same day at 9 a.m. EST, but ahead of the presentation, the publisher revealed this news after leaks surfaced yesterday.

Both games will be available to purchase for $19.99 each once the broadcast has finished, which means they're not coming to Nintendo Switch Online as initially thought, and you can pre-order them now via the [eShop](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/english-pokemon-firered-version-switch/). If you're in Japan, you can get your hands on a [special physical edition](https://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/switch-frlg/lineup/), but this version is not coming to the West.

_Fire Red_ and _Leaf Green_ are two of the most beloved Pokémon games. They adapted the always-popular Generation 1 games with modern (for the time!) graphics and gameplay, and they're still one of the preferred ways for fans to experience the joy of catching the original 151 Pokémon. They also added a whole new post-game area, the Sevii Islands, where players can find high-level Pokémon, including some from the Johto region.

The Pokémon Presents broadcast will likely also showcase Pokémon Pokopia, the upcoming Pokémon-themed life sim that we discovered "has so much more going on under the surface" in our [preview](https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-pokopia-preview-switch-2/) earlier this month. Here's hoping we also get some news about Gen 10, and it's about time we got a Gen 5 remake too, right?
