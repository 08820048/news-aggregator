Disney Lorcana's new Winterspell expansion is [out this week on February 20](https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-lorcana-full-release-schedule-2026), but that's not the only thing for fans to look forward to in the coming days.

As part of the 11th set's rollout, the Lorcana team is also launching a brand new ["Collection Starter Set"](https://zdcs.link/Q45Aqd?object_uuid=768a0763-9098-4230-8e25-37883cb2fb3f&t=article) alongside the ["Scrooge McDuck Gift Box"](https://zdcs.link/aA8d57?object_uuid=768a0763-9098-4230-8e25-37883cb2fb3f&t=article) on March 13, 2026. Both are now up for preorder at Amazon and are priced at $29.99 each.

### Disney Lorcana TCG: Collection Starter Set - Stitch Edition - Includes 4 Winterspell Booster Packs

So what's included in these new sealed sets? Starting with the Collection Starter Set, the first of which is themed around Stitch, it includes four Winterspell boosters, a Stitch Rock Star Card portfolio, and a Glimmer Foil promo collector’s guide.

The card portfolio is ready to hold up to 80 cards, which is perfect for any collectors who are just getting started, or even long-term fans who just want another fun way to keep their cards safe. You'll certainly need it as well, as the four boosters for the new Winterspell expansion will contain 48 cards just on their own.

### Disney Lorcana TCG: Scrooge McDuck Gift Box

I'd even say this is just as much of a good gift option for any Disney fans in your life as the Scrooge McDuck Gift Box that's also now up for preorder online.

Speaking of which, the new gift box includes a Scrooge McDuck – S.H.U.S.H. glimmer foil promo card, five assorted booster packs, alongside handy Storage Box with dividers that can keep up to 250 sleeved cards.

Curiously, while this is techinically part of the Winterspell launch window, it is worth noting that the five packs included could also be from prior sets, so you could get five from Winterspell, or you could end up with some classics.

It's the luck of the draw I guess, but if you'd prefer to avoid the randomness, I'd instead opt for the Collection Set, or even just a fat set of [24 packs from the Winterspell display box](https://zdcs.link/Qb81YJ?object_uuid=768a0763-9098-4230-8e25-37883cb2fb3f&t=article).
