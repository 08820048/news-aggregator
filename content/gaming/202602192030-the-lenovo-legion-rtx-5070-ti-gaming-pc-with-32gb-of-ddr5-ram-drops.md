Nowadays it's quite difficult to find an RTX 5070 Ti prebuilt for under $2,000, and when you do, it's usually stripped of any other high-end component. However, for this week only, Lenovo actually has **two** [RTX 5070 Ti configurations](https://zdcs.link/aD8ZNR?object_uuid=5c394274-ed0f-4851-a3a0-7dfca1dd6f1e&t=article) priced under $2K, and they're actually pretty well equipped otherwise. This is made possible thanks to a 10% off coupon code "**PDLIVE26**" that went live on Presidents Day and is, fortunately, still avaialble.

Thinking of saving money by building your own DIY RTX 5070 Ti system? Think again. The RTX 5070 Ti graphics card is currently selling for at least $250 over MSRP. Other options, such as the Radeon RX 9070 XT or RTX 5080, also have a steep markup. With the [rising prices of GPUs and RAM](https://www.ign.com/articles/2026-is-going-to-suck-for-pc-gaming), you don't want to miss out on this rare opportunity.

## Lenovo Legion Tower 5 RTX 5070 Ti Gaming PC for $1,799

[![Lenovo Legion Tower 5 Gen 10 Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX RTX 5070 Ti Gaming PC (32GB/1TB)](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/19/lenovolegiontower5-1771530174688.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/aD8ZNR?object_uuid=5c394274-ed0f-4851-a3a0-7dfca1dd6f1e&t=article "Lenovo Legion Tower 5 Gen 10 Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX RTX 5070 Ti Gaming PC (32GB/1TB)")

### Lenovo Legion Tower 5 Gen 10 Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX RTX 5070 Ti Gaming PC (32GB/1TB)

First on the list is a Lenovo Legion Tower 5 Gen 10 GeForce RTX 5070 Ti gaming PC, which drops down to $1,799.99 aafter coupon "**PDLIVE26**". Specs include an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU, GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GPU, 32GB of DDR5-5600MHz RAM, and a 1TB SSD. Rare for a Legion Tower 5 system, the CPU is cooled by a 240mm all-in-one liquid cooler.

Something to note is that this PC is equipped with an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU on a customized Intel HM870 mATX motherboard. The 275HX is traditionally a laptop CPU, and laptop CPUs are permanently soldered onto the motherboard. That means you won't be able to swap out the CPU for a better one in the future. If you don't intend on swapping the CPU (and let's face it, most of us who buy prebuilts probably never will), then you'll get excellent performance out of this chip.

The [RTX 5070 Ti](https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-review) offers the best bang for your buck amongst the new Nvidia Blackwell cards in terms of 4K gaming performance. It performs neck-and-neck with the previous generation [RTX 4080 Super](https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-super-review) and pulls ahead in any game that supports multi-frame generation, especially with the [recent DLSS 4.5 update](https://in.ign.com/tech/251831/feature/nvidia-here-is-why-i-chose-team-green-and-how-dlss-45-and-its-2nd-gen-transformer-model-changed-my-g).

If you don't like the idea of a soldered-on CPU, Lenovo is offering a noteworthy deal on another 5070 Ti gaming PC. This time it's equipped with a desktop-class Intel Core Ultra 9 285K processor. This is Intel's best consumer CPU at the moment, featuring a max turbo frequency of 5.6GHz and a whopping 24 cores, excelling at any task. The superior, upgradeable CPU isn't the only perk that you get. The system is housed in a roomier Legion Tower 7 chassis that includes more fans for airflow and an enthusiast-grade 360mm AIO liquid cooler.

### If you plan to game on a 1080p or 1440p monitor, then save some money and get this Lenovo Legion Tower 5 RTX 5070 gaming PC for $1575 instead.

### Lenovo Legion Tower 5 Gen 10 Intel Core Ultra 7 265F RTX 5070 Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)

This configuration is equipped with a liquid-cooled Intel Core Ultra 7 265F CPU, GeForce RTX 5070 12GB GPU, 32GB of DDR5-5600MHz RAM, and a 2TB M.2 SSD. The RTX 5070 is the best GPU for up to 1440 gaming without overspending. Compared to the previous generation GPUs, it offers a slight performance improvement over the RTX 4070 Super, which was and still is an excellent GPU. The fps gain is greater in games that support DLSS 4.5 with multi-frame gen.
