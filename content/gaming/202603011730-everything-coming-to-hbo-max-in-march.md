While things may be a [little up in the air for Warner Bros.](https://www.ign.com/articles/netflix-walks-away-from-bidding-war-for-warner-bros-leaving-the-path-open-for-paramount-to-win), we know for sure that HBO Max is continuing as normal. For now, at least. That means a pretty massive list of new streaming releases each month, including new HBO Originals.

In March, the streamer will premiere Rooster and DTF St Louis alongside the continued weekly releases for The Pitt Season 2. There’s also a surprising amount of superhero, anime, and horror movies, some of which are coming to streaming for the first time. If you’re curious what new series and movies your subscription will get you this month, here’s everything coming to HBO Max in March.

## **Highlights Coming to HBO Max**

### **New HBO Originals: DTF St Louis and Rooster**

Two new scripted HBO originals are premiering in March. DTF St. Louis is pitched as a dark comedy that follows a mid-life love triangle with seemingly deadly consequences. The stars of that love triangle happen to be Jason Bateman, David Harbour, and Linda Cardellini. You can see what we thought of the show in [IGN's 8 out of 10 review](https://www.ign.com/articles/dtf-st-louis-review-recap).

The other big premiere is Rooster, from creators Bill Lawrence and Matt Tarses.This more or less straight comedy focuses on Steve Carell as an author who gets involved in his daughter’s college scene.

### **The Pitt Continues Its Second Season**

The Pitt was one of the only shows to [get an IGN 10/10](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-pitt-season-1-review) back in 2025, and its second season seems to be [keeping up the quality](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-pitt-season-2-premiere-700-am-review). The medical drama will continue to stream new episodes every Thursday, with the season slated for an impressive (by modern standards) 15 episodes total.

### **Angel’s Egg Gets a 4K Restoration**

HBO signed a deal with anime distributor GKids [back in October](https://www.ign.com/articles/hbo-max-new-streaming-deal-with-gkids) to bring some otherwise rare anime movies to streaming. One of the massive standouts from that original list is finally coming to fruition in March: the 4K restoration of Angel’s Egg, an acclaimed cult classic sci-fi film from Mamoru Oshii.

### **The Return of Final Destination**

Bit of a weird one, but the [Final Destination movies](https://www.ign.com/articles/final-destination-movies-in-order) were already on HBO Max until they were abruptly removed on December 31. Now, the first five movies are coming back to streaming, joining the most recent release, [Final Destination: Bloodlines](https://www.ign.com/articles/final-destination-bloodlines-review).

### **A Spread of (Non-MCU) Spider-Man**

Spider-Man never really leaves the zeitgeist, if Sony’s willingness to attempt [yet another reboot](https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-plans-to-reboot-wider-spider-man-universe-after-kraven-madame-web-and-morbius-failures) is anything to go by. While the [MCU Spider-Man movies](https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-watch-the-spider-man-movies-in-chronological-order) will always find their home on Disney+, the Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies as well as The Amazing Spider-Man duology are both making their way to HBO Max.
