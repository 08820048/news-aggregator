Amazon has announced a second round of layoffs in two months, impacting 16,000 roles across the company.

In a [statement](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-layoffs-corporate-jan-2026), senior vice president of people experience and technology Beth Galetti reiterated that Amazon is continuing to "reduce layers, increase ownership, and remove bureaucracy."

Galetti originally shared this outlook during [a round of layoffs last October](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/amazon-to-shed-14000-jobs-to-be-organized-more-leanly-despite-acknowledging-it-is-performing-well), which affected 14,000 people across human resources, operations, devices and services, and Amazon Web Services.

While Amazon did not share which divisions were affected by the latest cuts, [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/amazon-cuts-16000-jobs-globally-broader-restructuring-2026-01-28/) reports that reductions are expected to be made across Amazon Web Services, retail, Prime Video, and human resources departments.

It's not clear whether Amazon's gaming division will be affected, as it was last October. _GamesIndustry.biz_ has contacted Amazon for clarification.

Amazon is offering "most" US-based employees 90 days to look for a new role internally. For those unable to or "choose not to look for one," they will be provided with "transition support including severance pay, outplacement services, health insurance benefits (as applicable), and more."

"Some of you may ask if this is the beginning of a new rhythm – where we announce broad reductions every few months," Galetti wrote.

"But just as we always have, every team will continue to evaluate the ownership, speed, and capacity to invent for customers, and make adjustments as appropriate. That’s never been more important than it is today in a world that’s changing faster than ever."

Galetti clarified that Amazon will "continue hiring and investing in strategic areas and functions that are critical to \[its\] future."
