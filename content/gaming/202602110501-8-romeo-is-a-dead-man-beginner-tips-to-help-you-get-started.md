Exploring the world of _Romeo Is a Dead Man_ without **beginner tips** is a difficult task as you're pitted against evil Juliet impostors and other space-time monstrosities. The boss fights in this sci-fi adventure are also no joke, but hitting their weak points with upgraded weapons while receiving an ample supply of Sentrey and Emerald Flowsion will grant you that much-needed edge.

Are you and your grandpa ready for action? Here are some tips and tricks to help you conquer space-time in _Romeo Is a Dead Man_.

* * *

## Always hit the weak points — repeatedly!

Did you spot a weird flower on an enemy's body? That's a **weak point**; be sure to hit it with a ranged weapon to deplete a large chunk of HP. Unfortunately, only elite enemies and bosses have weak points, so there's no need to look for them in common foes.

An important note to remember about weak points in _Romeo Is a Dead Man:_ **You can hit them more than once**, despite their damaged appearance following the first hit. If you hit them repeatedly, until they disappear, you'll stagger the boss, thus providing an amazing opportunity to unleash powerful melee attacks. It's also good to know: **Every ranged weapon has** **unlimited ammo**, so there's no need to be stingy. You do need to reload, though!

## Grab space debris — it's free!

While flying your spaceship toward the next mission, you may occasionally spot some tiny glowing orbs to your left and right. If you move the ship's reticle (your cursor) onto these orbs and wait a moment, you may collect some **food resources**, such as tomatoes and carrots, or **space debris**, which can be transformed into the upgrade material called Sentrey.

    ![Arrows point to space debris in Romeo Is A Dead Man.](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/romeo-is-a-dead-man-tips-space-debris.jpg?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2)Graphic: Marloes Valentina Stella/Polygon | Source images: Grasshopper Manufacture via Polygon

If you'd like to get a head start on the first mission in Chapter 2, which directs you to the Dimensional Seer, try to collect as much debris as you can find before entering the new dimension. Leave the steering wheel (thus re-entering the ship) before landing to spend your newfound resources in the following locations:

-   Find the **Sentrey Forge** in the upgrade room (left side of the ship) to turn your space debris into Sentrey. Fill the bar at the top until it's full, and you'll receive one Green Sentrey.
-   Go to the **Weapon Power Up Monitor** in the upgrade room (top right), click on a weapon you plan to use, and spend the Green Sentry to boost its abilities. Boosting "attack power" is always a safe bet.
-   Go to the **kitchen** on the right side of the ship. Use the food resources to cook some katsu curry. Afterward, open the item inventory and equip the dishes in your item slots, ready to be used during combat.

Continue the journey to the Dimensional Seer when you're ready.

## Get the Green Sentrey first

While using the Sentrey Forge, mind the difference between Green and Red Sentrey. Fill the top bar to obtain the green variant, which requires 100 space debris, and the red bar to obtain the red version, which requires 1,000 space debris.

    ![The Sentrey creation menu in Romeo Is A Dead Man.](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/romeo-is-a-dead-man-tips-sentrey.jpg?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2)Graphic: Marloes Valentina Stella/Polygon | Source images: Grasshopper Manufacture via Polygon

Since **Green Sentrey** is used for basic weapon upgrades and **Red Sentrey** is used for high-level upgrades, you won't have any use for Red Sentrey as a new _Romeo Is a Dead Man_ player. In the first couple of chapters (until Chapter 4 or so), be sure to forge Green Sentrey only!

## Build an overpowered weapon

It may be tempting to unlock and try different _Romeo Is a Dead Man_ weapons straight away, but it's best to **fully upgrade** one melee weapon and one ranged weapon first. After all, you can only equip one of each type simultaneously, so it's much better to have one overpowered blade rather than four mediocre ones.

## Make curry and sell the surplus

_Romeo Is a Dead Man_ features a fairly simple **cooking minigame**:

1.  Go to the kitchen aboard the spaceship.
2.  Ask your mom for a katsu curry.
3.  Carefully watch the temperature meter in the lower right and press the interaction button when the temperature hits "180" to complete the dish.

The closer you are to 180, the higher the dish's tier (ranging from D-tier to S-tier).

As you can only carry one dish of the same type, you may feel the urge to discard your low-tier food and try again. However, as discarding dishes doesn't refund any ingredients, it's better to **sell them to Shiroyabu**, the computer-merchant stationed on the Last Night. Find him on the left, between the upgrade room and the bedroom, and sell any katsu curry you don't wish to use in return for Emerald Flowsion. Depending on the tier, you'll receive 10 to 200 Flowsion per dish.

    ![An arrow points to the store in Romeo Is A Dead Man.](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/romeo-is-a-dead-man-tips-sell-curry.jpg?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2)Graphic: Marloes Valentina Stella/Polygon | Source images: Grasshopper Manufacture via Polygon

To obtain only high-quality food in _Romeo Is a Dead Man_, be sure to **save your game before cooking** (there's a Space-Time Pharmacy on the left side of the ship, in the bedroom), and reload that save until you get an A- or S-tier dish from the cooking minigame. Why settle for D-tier curry?

## Stop touching the Space-Time Pharmacy

To replenish your HP, teleport to a new location, unlock upgrades during missions, and save your game manually, you must interact with a large green cross: a **Space-Time Pharmacy**. As tempting as it is to use a Space-Time Pharmacy, refrain from touching them often. The HP recovery is nice, but doing so will **respawn every enemy**.

Don't overstate the importance of manually saving your game, either. _Romeo Is a Dead Man_'s autosave feature makes fairly regular backups, so there's really no need to run back to a Space-Time Pharmacy as you progress through a mission. In other words, falling in battle usually doesn't mean you need to restart from the last manual save, so it's fine to continue fighting until Romeo becomes — quite literally — a dead man.

## Or… Keep touching the Space-Time Pharmacy?

If you're the farming sort, you may actually be thrilled to hear the words "enemies respawn upon touching the Space-Time Pharmacy," as it provides ample opportunity for **Emerald Flowsion farming**, a resource used to unlock new weapons, buy items, and improve Romeo's stats.

As Emerald Flowsion is dropped by all enemies, and won't disappear from your inventory upon using the Space-Time Pharmacy, you might want to find a Pharmacy near a large group of common enemies, take them all out, claim their Emerald Flowsion, and then use the Pharmacy to respawn them. Rinse and repeat until you've got the desired amount of Emerald Flowsion.

## Collect the spotty mushrooms

Yes, they look poisonous, but the spotty blobs found on floors and walls during missions are actually safe to touch. What's more, touching them yields **+5 Emerald Flowsion**, an important resource to unlock new weapons, buy items, and boost your stats. Unfortunately, spotty blobs don't respawn upon touching a Space-Time Pharmacy.

    ![Arrows point to spotty blobs containing Emerald Flowsion and HP recovery in Romeo Is A Dead Man.](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/romeo-is-a-dead-man-tips-spotted-mushrooms.jpg?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2)Graphic: Marloes Valentina Stella/Polygon | Source images: Grasshopper Manufacture via Polygon

While exploring _Romeo Is a Dead Man_'s cubic space-time realm, you'll find another kind of spotty blob. Unlike the real-time ones, they don't contain Emerald Flowsion, but they do **recover some HP**. If your health bar isn't full already, best to touch a bunch of them while you're there!
