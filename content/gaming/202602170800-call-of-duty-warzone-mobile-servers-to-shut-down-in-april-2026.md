Activision will shut down servers for Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile on April 17, 2026.

Warzone Mobile was [removed from iOS and Android app stores last May](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/activision-pulls-call-of-duty-warzone-from-ios-and-google-play-stores) because it "did not meet expectations."

"While we're proud of the accomplishment of bringing Call of Duty: Warzone to mobile in an authentic way, it unfortunately did not meet our expectations with mobile-first players like it has with PC and console audiences," the publisher said in a [blog post](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/activision-pulls-call-of-duty-warzone-from-ios-and-google-play-stores).

At the time, Activision clarified that servers would remain online, but it would not provide new content or updates. Social features and in-app purchases were discontinued on this date.

After the servers go offline in April, guest accounts for Warzone Mobile will no longer be accessible. Activision accounts will remain available through Activision websites and titles that require an account.

Warzone Mobile launched in March 2024. According to AppMagic estimates, [the game reached $1.4 million in consumer spending](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/four-days-after-launching-globally-call-of-duty-warzone-generates-14m) in the four days following its release
