For Presidents Day, Amazon is offering the lowest price I've seen for an OLED gaming monitor. Even more surprisingly, the deal is for a Samsung monitor. The 2025 [27" Samsung G5](https://zdcs.link/z7RLZn?object_uuid=608fa2a0-8d21-423a-aedf-6a5c9f71a940&t=article) OLED gaming monitor recently dropped to just $349.99 with free delivery. That's $200 off its $550 list price. This monitor also has a 3 year warranty that includes burn-in coverage.

### 27” Samsung Odyssey OLED G5 QHD QD-OLED Gaming Monitor

The Samsung Odyssey OLED G5 (G50SF) is a 2025 model 27" display with a 2560x1440 or QHD resolution, measuring out to a respectable pixel density of 108ppi. It's equipped with a quantum dot OLED panel that boasts a near-instantaneous 0.03ms response time, near infinite contrast ratio, and true black levels. QD OLED panels are considered better than traditional W-OLED panels because they are brighter and offer a wider color gamut.

This monitor also features a fast 180Hz refresh rate and Nvidia G-Sync compatibility. If you pair it with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 graphics card or higher, you should be able to hit that 180fps ceiling on older games like Fortnite, Apex Legends, and Valorant. For newer games like Battlefield 6 or Black Ops 7, you might need to step up to an RTX 5070 Ti or Radeon 9070 XT to achieve that 180fps ceiling. The display comes equipped with both DisplayPort and HDMI ports.

As mentioned earlier, this monitor has a 3 year warranty that includes OLED burn-in coverage. That's still pretty uncommon across most OLED brands, especially when you're looking at the less expensive models. Most come with just a 1 year warranty with no burn-in protection.
