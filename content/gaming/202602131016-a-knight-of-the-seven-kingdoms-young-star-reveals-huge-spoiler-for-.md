An enormous spoiler for [A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms](https://www.ign.com/tv/a-knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms) has been dropped by the TV show's young star, revealing the fates of both its lead characters — as told to him by Game of Thrones creator George R.R. Martin.

Speaking to [Decider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL11JAqY2m8), A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms' Dexter Sol Ansell (who plays Egg) said he had been told by Martin of what really happened during the fated Tragedy at Summerhall — [an event that TV viewers have already seen prophesised](https://www.ign.com/articles/a-knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-episode-3-prophecy-fortune-egg-aegon).

As Ansell begins his explanation, he's interrupted by his co-star Peter Claffrey (Dunk) who tries his best to suggest this isn't exactly what happens. But it's clear this is information we're not yet supposed to know — so read on with fair warning.

Firstly a note on what the Tragedy at Summerhall is. As detailed in various A Song of Ice and Fire Books, a terrible fire at the Targaryen retreat of Summerhall is believed to claim the lives of both A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms' main characters — seemingly ending their stories. It's also been suggested that the fire is magical in nature, a result of the Targaryen attempt to hatch ancient dragon eggs.

This is the moment that viewers have already seen a fortune teller reveal to Egg in the series' third episode, when he's told: "You shall be king, and die in a hot fire, and worms shall feed upon your ashes, and all who know you shall rejoice in your passing." Which sounds pretty concrete.

But the finer details of what happens at Summerhall have never been precisely chronicled, and the deaths of both the show's main characters would definitely be a downbeat ending. But now, Ansell has said that all is not as it seems — and this is your last warning to turn away now.

"I do know a bit about when Egg is trying to make dragons in the Summerhall and then there's a huge fire," Ansell says, when asked if he knew where his character's story was headed. "And we know from George..."

"We don't..." Claffrey carefully interjects, "yeah we don't know if that's exactly what happens..."

"We know Dunk survives but we don't know if Egg survives yet," Ansell plunges on.

Claffrey then makes frantic gestures, and tries to add: "We don't know exactly what happens, but let's just get this Season 1 out of the way and we'll see."

A Song of Ice and Fire fans have of course been digesting the news of Dunk's survival — and theorizing what the character's fate may now be. Does he simply disappear from history, perhaps to go mourn the apparent death of Egg? Or does he continue on, under a different name or alias? Unsurprisingly, the theories that Dunk is actually a Game of Thrones character we've already met are running rampant.

"My guess: Because his king and friend died under his watch (and he will be sad and traumatized by Summerhall) Dunk will just vanish from the public and end up on Tarth," wrote fan Romy\_90 on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1r3cqsr/spoilers_extended_dex_sol_ansell_lets_out_massive/). "His shield ended up on Tarth somehow, so he will probably live a few quiet years on the island before his death."

"Hilarious," noted Sleepy\_C. "Biggest lore advancement in a decade on a random morning chat show... Dunk is Coldhands. Bloodraven reaches out to him after the Tragedy, he travels north and dies beyond the Wall from his injuries sustained during the fires and is reanimated as Coldhands."

How will this all play out on screen, and where will the show choose to wrap up the story of Dunk and Egg? All of this remains to be seen, with several more seasons of the series planned.
