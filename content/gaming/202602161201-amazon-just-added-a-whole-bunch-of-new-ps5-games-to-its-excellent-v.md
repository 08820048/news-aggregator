Amazon's ongoing sale on a wide variety of PS5 games just got better this week, with a whole bunch of new games being added to the sale. That includes some previously outstanding deals, such as [Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater](https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater) for just $30, alongside [Silent Hill f](https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-f), [Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds](https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-racing-crossworlds), and more.

But that's just the start of what's available, as the online retailer has opened up some excellent deals on several other great games for PlayStation 5. That includes Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 for $30, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth for $30, Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered for $20, and even more.

## Several New PS5 Games on Sale at Amazon Today

We've also included some brand new offers in Woot's latest "Mega Video Game Sale" - especially as the retailer is also owned by Amazon, and allows fast Prime delivery, so it definitely applies to Amazon's ongoing sale as well.

What makes these latest deals even better is that some of the games above have hit their lowest prices yet at the retailer. Price tracker camelcamelcamel shows that this is the lowest price [Silent Hill f](https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0F1C14LY8), [Civ VII](https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0DDR3VVVP), [Double Dragon Revive](https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0FGB66VX5), and [Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds](https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0F8R7QS54) (with its coupon) have all hit at Amazon so far. Similar to Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, with the help of the coupon on its store page, this also marks a new low price for [Space Marine 2](https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0CVSDJNKS) at the retailer.

And while it's not the lowest price point it has ever hit at Amazon, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater has [matched its Black Friday price](https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-snake-eater-remake-best-deal-walmart-black-friday), which is certainly still a deal to celebrate. If you haven't added it to your library yet, now is a great time while it's still on sale for $30.

That applies to all of the available games: This is a great opportunity to scoop them up and save while they're still on sale. They're not the only game deals worth taking advantage of right now, though. If you're looking for more outside of PlayStation, [February’s Humble Choice lineup](https://www.ign.com/articles/humble-choice-february-2026) has dropped for PC players as well, offering the chance to add 8 games to your digital library for just $15 when you sign up for a Humble Choice membership. This month leads with Resident Evil Village, which is definitely worth grabbing ahead of Resident Evil: Requiem.
