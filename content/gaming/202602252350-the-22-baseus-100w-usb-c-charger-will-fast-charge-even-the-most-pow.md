From portable gaming handhelds to smartphones, our lives rely on portable, untethered electronics, and it can't hurt to always have a charger on hand. Amazon is currently offering a [Baseus Picogo 100W USB Type-C wall charger](https://zdcs.link/aeb2j5?object_uuid=a49034cc-d776-4733-9a0a-92f6985e2cb0&t=article) for just $21.99 after you apply coupon code "**76CRAZVA**". You don't need to be an Amazon Prime member to get this deal. This diminutive adapter can fast charge even the most power hungry handheld gaming PCs like the ROG Xbox Ally X.

### Baseus 100W USB-C Wall Charger

The Baseus wall charger is tiny, measuring only 3.2" x 1.7" x 1.7" but it's still able to pack in three charging ports: two 100W USB Type-C and one 22.5W USB Type-A. Note that the maximum output for all three ports is 100W, so if you used both USB-C ports at time same time, you would pull 70W + 30W.

The 100W of USB-C Power Delivery is higher than what I typically see at this price point. This charger has a higher output than the stock adapters that come packaged with power hungry handheld gaming PCs like the Xbox Ally X, ROG Ally X, Legion Go S, and Legion Go 2; even though these handhelds support up to 100W charging rates, they're supplied with 60W max charging adapters. It's also compatible with devices like the Steam Deck and Switch 2 that can only accept a lower rate, since the charger only delivers as much power as the device allows, nothing more.
