The developer of [Stellar Blade](https://www.ign.com/games/stellar-blade) is looking to expand the game to more platforms, signalling a potential release on Xbox and Nintendo Switch 2.

Korean studio Shift Up mentioned the move in the Q&A section of its most [recent financial report.](https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&idx=339&page=1&code=ir_eng) It said Stellar Blade had established itself as "a steady, long-tail IP, supported by sustained sales momentum and strong user reception since launch," and that the team was "reviewing platform expansion beyond PS5 and PC to broaden audience reach." "This approach is expected to both introduce the title to new players and gradually build anticipation for the next chapter in the series," Shift Up continued.

That "next chapter" is, of course, sequel [Stellar Blade 2](https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-developer-confirms-sequel-plans), which is now in development.

"We expect 2026 to be a year in which more users experience the existing title while momentum and anticipation builds toward the next phase of the Stellar Blade franchise," Shift Up added.

Shift Up is also working on [Project Spirits](https://in.ign.com/project-spirits), to be published by Level Infinite. Self-described as the studio's "next flagship title," it is progressing "steadily under strategic collaboration with a global partner."

"The project is being developed as a next-generation flagship title with a focus on achieving a high level of completion and quality, taking into account its global scalability," Shift Up explained. "Through co-development and other strategic partnerships, Shift Up and the global partner continues to maintain close collaboration across full spectrum of planning, development, and service operations."

We can explicit further details "within the year," including information about the project’s "direction and key features."

Last month, [Shift Up once again gave bonuses and gifts worth around $4,000 to its entire team](https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-studio-shift-up-gifts-staff-yet-another-big-bonus-this-time-an-apple-watch-airpods-max-and-a-3400-cash-bonus), including a pair of Apple AirPods Max, an Apple Watch, and a cash bonus of around $3,400. The year prior, the studio [gifted all staff a PS5 Pro as well as a cash bonus of $3,400](https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-dev-is-doing-so-well-its-given-all-311-staff-a-ps5-pro-and-3400-bonus). Staff also secured a Nintendo Switch 2 each in June when Stellar Blade hit the 3 million copies sold milestone. In 2024, staff were given pre-paid credit cards worth around $6,800, and in 2023, staff were given iPhone 14s, among other bonuses. The studio provides these bonuses to retain and encourage existing talent.

Meanwhile, the CEO of Shift Up recently received the [Presidential Commendation at this year's Korean Content Awards](https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-director-receives-presidential-commendation-for-development-of-korean-game-industry) for his contribution to the Korean games industry with the games Goddess of Victory: Nikke and Stellar Blade.
