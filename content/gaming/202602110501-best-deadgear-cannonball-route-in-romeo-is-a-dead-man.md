_Romeo Is a Dead Man_'s **DeadGear Cannonball** power-up minigame is so much more than some classic arcade entertainment. While navigating the purple alien through its 2D world, every passive buff you pick up will count as a power-up for Romeo. In other words, it's best to pick up as many HP boosts, attack power-ups, and extra Bloody Summer charges as possible.

Here's **how to get the best DeadGear Cannonball route** in _Romeo Is a Dead Man_, along with a full DeadGear Cannonball item map.

## The best DeadGear Cannonball routes in Romeo Is a Dead Man

DeadGear Cannonball becomes available upon your first visit to the Last Night spaceship. Interact with the arcade machine at the bottom of the upgrade room to start the minigame.

The minigame's difficulty lies in the **Emerald Flowsion requirement**; the further you move, the more Emerald Flowsion you consume. Since you also need this resource for weapon upgrades, Bastard seed purchases, katsu curry ingredients, and more, it's important to find an efficient route.

As you can't see the full map at a glance, here's an edited version of **the entire DeadGear Cannonball layout**, complete with all items:

You're free to reset the game as often as you like without penalty, so you don't need a perfect route on your first attempt. Furthermore, the DeadGear Cannonball map keeps the same layout throughout the game, so you can expand your existing without having to start over. Instead of returning to the Last Night spaceship, it's also possible to modify your DeadGear Cannonball route at a Space-Time Pharmacy.

Although you should keep in mind that the best stats in _Romeo Is a Dead Man_ depend on your personal playstyle (if you heavily rely on melee, for example, there's no need to pick up that many ranged attack power-ups), here are some suggestions for the most efficient power-up routes at different points in the game.

## Best DeadGear Cannonball route for early-game survival

During Chapter 2, you'll likely have around 1,000 to 1,500 Emerald Flowsion. This is enough to grab a couple of valuable upgrades: A **regenetizer charge** (to restore HP during combat) and **extra Bloody Summer HP recovery** (regain HP upon using your ultimate attack). Pair that with a few handy attack upgrades, and you have a decent setup for early-game battles.

This route costs **less than 1,300 Emerald Flowsion** and unlocks the following power-ups:

-   Melee attack up: +1
-   Ranged attack up: +1
-   HP up: +1
-   Regenetizer carry limit up: +1
-   Regenetizer HP recovery up: +0
-   Reload speed up: +0
-   Aim speed up: +0
-   Bloody charge capacity up: +0
-   Bloody Summer HP recovery up: +1

## Best DeadGear Cannonball route for Bloody Summer

**Blood Charge Capacity UP** is one of the best stat upgrades in _Romeo Is a Dead Man_ as it adds an extra charge to Bloody Summer, your ultimate attack. This enables you to charge your ultimate even if you already filled the gauge once. Now you can save your ultimate attacks for the opportune moment.

Unfortunately, there are only two of them, and they're placed fairly far from the DeadGear Cannonball starting point. The shortest route to the nearest Blood Charge Capacity power-up is this one:

    ![A good DeadGear Cannonball route to boost Bloody Summer in Romeo Is a Dead Man's early game.](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/romeo-is-a-dead-man-deadgear-cannonball-4.jpg?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2)Graphic: Marloes Valentina Stella/Polygon | Source images: Grasshopper Manufacture via Polygon

Eventually, you can expand this route to **grab the second Blood Charge Capacity Upgrade** as well. If you take the portal in the upper left corner, as shown in the picture below, you can reach the second upgrade with **3,800 Emerald Flowsion**.

You will receive the following stats in total:

-   Melee attack up: +1
-   Ranged attack up: +1
-   HP up: +1
-   Regenetizer carry limit up: +0
-   Regenetizer HP recovery up: +1
-   Reload speed up: +1
-   Aim speed up: +0
-   Bloody charge capacity up: +2
-   Bloody Summer HP recovery up: +2

## Best DeadGear Cannonball route in mid-game

If you don't care about rare upgrades that much and would rather have as many power-ups as possible, this _Romeo Is a Dead Man_ stat route is for you. As item density is far higher around DeadGear Cannonball's starting point, it's best to **stick to the center of the map**. Try to circle around the starting point, like this:

    ![A potential DeadGear Cannonball route in Romeo Is a Dead Man.](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/romeo-is-a-dead-man-deadgear-cannonball-3.jpg?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2)Graphic: Marloes Valentina Stella/Polygon | Source images: Grasshopper Manufacture via Polygon

At the cost of **just over 4,000 Emerald Flowsion**, you'll receive the following stats:

-   Melee attack up: +2
-   Ranged attack up: +3
-   HP up: +5
-   Regenetizer carry limit up: +2
-   Regenetizer HP recovery up: +1
-   Reload speed up: +1
-   Aim speed up: +0
-   Bloody charge capacity up: +0
-   Bloody Summer HP recovery up: +1

If you don't need that much HP, go for the attack power-up at the end of the route instead.

## Best DeadGear Cannonball route in late-game

Once you've got Emerald Flowsion aplenty, you can extend the previous route into a longer one. If you follow this example, you'll keep the base power-ups from the center of the map but also grab **two rare upgrades** at the end: a Blood Charge Capacity upgrade and an aim speed upgrade (how fast you point your weapon — not to be confused with reload speed).

For **7,700 Emerald Flowsion**, you will gain the following power-ups:

-   Ranged attack up: +3
-   HP up: +7
-   Regenetizer carry limit up: +2
-   Regenetizer HP recovery up: +1
