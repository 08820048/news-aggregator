The company reported that its net sales were up 99.3% year-on-year, hitting ¥1.9 trillion ($12.3 billion) for the first nine months of its 2025/26 financial year.

Meanwhile, operating profit rose 21.3% to hit ¥300.4 billion ($1.9 billion), while the company's ordinary profit came in at ¥445.8 billion ($2.9 billion), representing a 39.4% increase year-on-year.

To date, the Nintendo Switch 2 has sold 17.37 million units, 7.01 million of which were in the three months ending December 31, 2025. It's the most impressive sales quarter that the console has had so far, beating the 5.82 million units that the hardware shifted when it was released in Q1.

Nintendo Switch 2 is also outstripping its predecessor's performance; [in the first nine months of the company's 2018 financial year](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendos-revenue-rockets-as-switch-nears-15m-sold), the original Nintendo Switch had sold 14.86 million units following its March 2017 release. Nintendo Switch 2 launched later in the year – in June – and has sold more consoles in the same timeframe.

The Nintendo Switch did sell 3.25 million consoles for the nine months ending December 31, 2025, a 66% drop year-on-year. To date, the hardware has sold a total of 155.37 million copies and was played by 129 million people between January and December 2025. That's a very slight decrease on 2024's 130 million.

Nintendo Switch 2 software came in at 37.93 million sales, outperformed by Nintendo Switch's 108.93 million, though that itself was a 12.1 % decrease year-on-year. For the three months ending December 31, 2025, Nintendo Switch 2 sold 17.31 million games. In total, 58.7% of all Nintendo games sold during Q3 were physical.

The platform holder has also updated some sales figures for Nintendo Switch 2 titles; Mario Kart World has sold 14 million copies – and is by far the console's biggest seller to date – while Donkey Kong Bananza has shifted 4.25 million units. The Nintendo Switch 2 version of Pokémon Legends Z-A has sold 3.89 million, coming in ahead of Kirby Air Riders, which has shifted 1.76 million units.
