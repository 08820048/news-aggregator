The Lenovo Presidents Day Sale has plenty of deals on gaming laptops, but this one right here is, in my opinion, the best. You can pick up a [Lenovo Legion Pro 5 Gen 10](https://zdcs.link/QrJd2D?object_uuid=1e1facc3-dfb1-47d5-810f-8bbc34401041&t=article) gaming laptop, equipped with a 15" OLED display and RTX 5070 GPU, for just $1,259.99 after you apply an _unadvertised_ coupon code "**PDLIVE26**" (apply this on the shopping cart page). That's a total savings of $715, making it one of the least expensive RTX 5070 laptops I've seen for 2026 and a great deal overall considering the build quality of Lenovo's laptops.

## Lenovo Legion 5 RTX 5070 Gaming Laptop for $1,259.99

### Lenovo Legion 5 15" 2.5K OLED Intel Core Ultra 7 255HX RTX 5070 Gaming Laptop (16GB/1TB)

The Legion Pro boasts solid build quality, featuring an aluminum top lid and a sturdy plastic bottom chassis. The gorgeous 16" OLED display sports a 2.5K 189ppi resolution, 165Hz refresh rate, HDR 1000 True Black certification, and 100% DCI-P3 color space. This new 2025 model has also been updated with the Wi-Fi 7 standard. Connectivity options include two USB-C 10Gbps ports with DisplayPort 2.1 support (one with 100W of Power Delivery), RJ45 ethernet, and HDMI 2.1.

The rest of the specs include an Intel Core Ultra 7 255HX CPU, RTX 5070 GPU, 16GB of DDR5-5600MHz RAM and a 1TB SSD. The Intel Core Ultra 7 255HX has a max turbo frequency of 5.1GHz with 16 total cores. It's a good processor for gaming and you won't notice a performance improvement upgrading to a Core Ultra 9.

### The GeForce RTX 5070 is an excellent mobile GPU for current-gen gaming

The RTX 5070 is a full powered (unthrottled) mobile model with 115W TGP and performs about 5%-10% better than the RTX 4070 that it replaces. It also supports [DLSS 4.5](https://www.ign.com/articles/dlss-4-explained-everything-you-need-to-know-about-nvidias-latest-ai-upscaling-tech) and multi-frame generation which widens the performance gap in games that support it. This laptop will able to play most games smoothly even on the enhanced 2.5K resolution, although extremely high demand games like Cyberpunk 2077 will require some graphics settings adjustment to get there.
