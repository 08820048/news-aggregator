[Magic: The Gathering](https://www.ign.com/games/magic-the-gathering-trading-card-game) will kick off its [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles set](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-where-to-buy-updated-2026) this weekend with a prerelease window before launch next week, but the notoriously elusive Collector Boosters are now back in stock at Amazon.

Not only can you find a box in stock (which in itself is a small miracle), [but it’s discounted down to $424.93](https://zdcs.link/QxeXBb?object_uuid=5ce32472-206e-4759-862f-86cb177f152e&t=article). That nets you twelve packs - it's pricey, but potentially worth it.

## Save on MTG Collector Boosters For The New TMNT Set

For those new to the game, Collector Boosters offer the rarest cards in the Ninja Turtles-themed set, and are ideal for anyone looking for unique art treatments.

Will you get ‘better’ cards? No, not necessarily, but you’re more likely to find cards with higher resale value, hence why they cost an MSRP of $37.99 per pack. For anyone looking to _play_ Magic, the aptly-named Play Boosters are a better bet.

While Play Boosters aren’t as cheap as they were last week, there are other TMNT products on sale.
