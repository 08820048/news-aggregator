A three-day international strike is underway at Ubisoft in response to its [recent restructuring](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-reveals-new-creative-house-structure-cancels-games-and-announces-final-round-of-cost-cutting-and-studio-closures-to-drive-200m-savings), with at least 1,200 employees taking part yesterday.

Marc Rutschlé, Solidaires Informatique union representative at Ubisoft Paris, confirmed the participation numbers to _GamesIndustry.biz_. He noted that the strike mostly took place in France, with additional activity at Ubisoft Milan.

The strike is running from February 10 to February 12, 2026.

Solidaires Informatique [initially held a protest on January 22](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/anger-and-despair-reigning-supreme-at-ubisoft-following-restructuring-plan-says-union), saying it was an answer "to the absurdity of management's decisions." Further actions were planned, including the current strike.

On January 21, Ubisoft announced its "final" round of cost-cutting, which included the closure of several studios and the cancellation of six games.

"At this stage, it seems clear to us that Yves Guillemot has no knowledge or understanding of his company or its employees," Rutschlé said.

"The company is continuing its cost reduction and layoff plan. Our teams are already working under pressure, often understaffed. After several years without pay rises (or very small increases), we understand that once again, employees will not receive a raise this year."

The strikes are also in response to Ubisoft's return-to-office mandate requiring staff to work on-site five days a week.

In September 2024, [more than 700 workers at Ubisoft France went on a three-day strike](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/700-ubisoft-france-staff-walk-out-on-a-three-day-strike-in-dispute-over-home-working-and-pay) in response to this policy.
