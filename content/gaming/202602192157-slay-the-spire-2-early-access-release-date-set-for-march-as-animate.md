Developer Mega Crit has published a new animated trailer for [Slay the Spire 2](https://www.ign.com/games/slay-the-spire-2), revealing four-player co-op and an early access release date of March 5, 2026.

The sequel to the studio’s beloved roguelike deckbuilder reappeared with a two-and-a-half-minute trailer today. Alongside the promise to bring a host of new features to Early Access players on Steam in just a few weeks, the footage comes mixed with a stylish animation that almost looks like it could stand alone as its own TV show.

As the trailer’s silent hero falls in battle, we see others come to their aid, revealing that players won’t have to fight through Slay the Spire 2’s dark fantasy world alone. Gameplay featured in the footage highlights combat encounters for up to four players, with Mega Crit explaining in a [blog post on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2868840/view/538879349212840702?l=english) that the multiplayer mode will feature its own specific cards and team synergies.

While Early Access is said to come with new cards, characters, events, relics, potions, abilities, alternate acts, and more, today’s trailer shows off how some of these new mechanics will offer chaotic twists on the original formula. The footage also teases an additional new character to look forward to.

“For 1,000 years, the Spire lay dormant, its secrets buried and its horrors forgotten,” an official description for Slay the Spire 2 says. “Now, it has reopened, hungrier and more dangerous than ever, devouring all who dare to ascend.

“New perils demand sharper strategies, relentless cunning, and unwavering resolve. Outwit the Spire’s brutal trials and uncover the truths hidden at its peak.”

Slay the Spire 2 is Mega Crit’s follow-up to its massively popular 2019 original and was [announced](https://www.ign.com/articles/slay-the-spire-2-officially-announced-first-gameplay-screens-revealed) in 2024. Although [a delay](https://www.ign.com/articles/slay-the-spire-2-release-date-slips-to-march-2026-and-no-it-had-nothing-to-do-with-silksong-dev-insists) saw its release date move from late 2025 to this March, fans will no doubt be excited to hear they’ll now only need to wait two weeks before going hands-on when it comes to PC via Steam March 5.

For more, you can see why we thought the original [Slay the Spire](https://www.ign.com/games/slay-the-spire) is a [9/10](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/01/25/slay-the-spire-review).
