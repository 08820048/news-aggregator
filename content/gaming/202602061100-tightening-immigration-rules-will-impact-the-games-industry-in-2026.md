With the games industry increasingly dependent on access to global talent, immigration policy changes expected in both the United States and the United Kingdom in 2026 are set to influence how studios recruit, relocate and retain critical personnel. On both sides of the Atlantic, rising scrutiny, evolving review standards and new forms of vetting are shaping a more complex mobility environment – one that may materially affect project planning, hiring strategies and the movement of creative and technical specialists. While the mechanics of immigration control differ between the US and the UK, the direction of travel is similar. Governments are signalling a stronger emphasis on oversight, compliance and discretion in decision-making. For an industry built around cross-border collaboration and project-based timelines, these shifts raise practical questions about workforce planning, onboarding and long-term retention. The United States outlook Heading into 2026, US immigration is effectively moving to a higher difficulty setting, altering the way work-based petition and visa matters will be reviewed and approved. These changes reflect a trend toward greater government scrutiny of foreign nationals and broader social media vetting that now extends beyond tourist or student visas. For employers, applicants and the games industry in particular, where access to global talent is a competitive necessity, the evolving landscape can have material operational implications. Rather than a single policy change, 2026 is bringing several developments that reinforce one another. Tighter, more subjective review standards for work-based visas such as the L-1 (intra-company transfer), H-1B (specialty occupation) and O-1 (extraordinary ability) are expected to continue. At the same time, the US government is expanding its social media screening practices to cover employment-based categories, not just visitors or students. Together, these moves are likely to result in fewer interview appointments, longer background checks and extended processing times. "These moves are likely to result in fewer interview appointments, longer background checks and extended processing times" Tightening the standard of review for work-based visas Adjudication of work-based visa petitions in the United States has always involved an element of discretion. That subjectivity gives immigration authorities room to recalibrate how strictly eligibility criteria are applied without rewriting the underlying rules. US Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Department of State have signalled a continued emphasis on enhanced gatekeeping when assessing petitions for foreign workers. For categories such as the H-1B, L-1 and O-1, adjudicators are expected to apply a more exacting interpretation of statutory and regulatory requirements.In practice, this translates into deeper scrutiny of job duties, wage levels, organisational structures and the evidence supporting an applicant’s qualifications. For H-1B petitions, this often means closer examination of whether a role genuinely requires a specialised bachelor’s degree and whether the employer can demonstrate a consistent business need for the position. L-1 petitions may face stricter review of corporate relationships, managerial authority or the claimed specialist nature of a role. O-1 petitions may see more demanding analysis of whether an individual’s achievements rise to the level of “extraordinary ability” under the regulations. The visa application process has become increasingly demanding. | Image credit: USCIS These shifts reflect broader concerns about protecting US workers, preventing misuse of visa categories and ensuring petitions meet statutory requirements. For studios and publishers that depend on niche creative, engineering and design talent, this environment may require roles and qualifications to be defined with significantly greater precision. For leadership or managerial transfers, clearly documented reporting lines and decision-making authority can become increasingly important in establishing eligibility. Expansion of Online Presence Review to Work-Based Visas Another notable shift expected in 2026 is the expansion of social media and online presence review to a wider range of work-based visas. In 2025, this level of digital vetting of individuals was largely reserved for visitor visas and for foreign students and trainees. It served primarily as a security measure, allowing the US government to identify red flags, inconsistencies or indicators of behaviour that could violate immigration status or criminal law. For workers whose public identity blends personal and professional content, officers may find content that raises eligibility concerns and introduces a greater risk of visa denial. The US State Department has now extended this practice to work-based H-1B visas, and it is realistic to expect an expansion to other employment-based visa categories. Applicants must make their social media accounts available for review. This gives consular officers access to public posts, connections and online interactions. The process is intended to verify biographical information, assess behavioural indicators and evaluate whether an applicant’s online presence suggests any risk to the United States. While the goals of this policy are rooted in broad security concerns, its application to work-based visas marks a shift in how consular officers evaluate professional applicants. For workers whose public identity blends personal and professional content, common in technical and creative fields, consular officers may find content that raises eligibility concerns and introduces a greater risk of visa denial.For O-1 applicants in particular, whose professional reputation is often established through public-facing work, interviews may involve more scrutiny of online statements and activity. Employers and applicants in the games industry should consider adopting more structured guidance for preparing online profiles, anticipating how posts, comments and affiliations might be interpreted in a visa context, should social media vetting be widely extended to the O-1 category in the coming year. Interview Backlogs, Cancelled Appointments and Longer Wait Times In-person interviews are subject to increasing delays. | Image credit: USCIS The operational consequences of expanded scrutiny of online presence are already emerging. Several high-volume consulates, particularly in India, have begun cancelling or rescheduling visa interviews to accommodate the added time required for social-media review and supplemental vetting. Applicants with confirmed H-1B appointments in late 2025 have seen their interviews pushed into early or mid-2026 at a small number of US consulates. The expectation is that wider delays will appear in the coming weeks across a greater number of consular posts where visa interviews are held. Because each case now requires more evaluative time, consular posts must reduce the number of appointments they can manage daily. This constraint creates a cascading effect: fewer interviews mean more backlog, and more backlog means longer delays not only for initial applicants but also for renewals and dependents.These delays can complicate onboarding, affect project staffing and increase uncertainty around workforce mobility. The games industry, which relies heavily on clear project scheduling and adherence to targeted release-date deadlines, will face operational pressures. Publishers and developers may need to adjust hiring pipelines to accommodate unpredictable visa timelines, especially for roles requiring US-based in-person work. Strategic implications for studios and publishers Collectively, these developments show a system trending toward more comprehensive and more subjective vetting at every stage. For employers in the games industry, several actions will become increasingly important. First, petition preparation should begin earlier and include more detailed evidence than in prior years. This means clearer organisational charts, more explicit descriptions of duties and stronger documentation of the business need driving each hire. "Petition preparation should begin earlier and include more detailed evidence than in prior years." Second, employers should consider providing applicants with guidance on managing their online visibility prior to filing a petition. This is not about altering content retroactively but about ensuring that publicly available information accurately reflects the applicant’s qualifications and intentions. Third, production schedules and staffing plans may need to include additional buffer time for visa approval and onboarding. Teams should plan for the possibility of interview cancellations, rescheduling and administrative processing. These factors all risk posing significant delays to the issuance of a visa to work in the United States. The UK Outlook: Earned Settlement and Ongoing Mobility Challenges In the United Kingdom, the policy trajectory is different in form but similar in effect. Recent proposals around earned settlement suggest a move away from settlement being driven primarily by time spent in the country, toward a more conditional model that places greater weight on economic contribution, salary progression and compliance history. "Settlement may become less predictable and more closely tied to sustained earnings and continuity of employment." For international talent in the games industry, this may change expectations around long-term residence. Settlement may become less predictable and more closely tied to sustained earnings and continuity of employment. For studios, this introduces new considerations when planning multi-year projects or relying on key personnel over extended development cycles. While the UK has framed earned settlement as a way to encourage contribution and integration, it also adds complexity for employers navigating sponsorship obligations, cost pressures and evolving compliance requirements. Combined with existing challenges around sponsorship administration and visa costs, the changes may influence decisions about where and how roles are based. Studios operating across both jurisdictions may therefore need to think more strategically about deployment models, succession planning and alternative immigration routes to maintain continuity in development teams. Planning ahead Viewed together, the US and UK immigration systems are shifting the meta toward greater restriction and scrutiny. While the motivations and mechanics differ, the impact on the games industry is consistent. Both jurisdictions are tightening standards in ways that influence hiring, deployment and long-term planning. Studios that invest in forward-looking, adaptable mobility strategies — accounting for longer timelines, heightened review and less predictable settlement outcomes — will be better positioned to operate effectively as the difficulty setting increases and the meta continues to evolve.
