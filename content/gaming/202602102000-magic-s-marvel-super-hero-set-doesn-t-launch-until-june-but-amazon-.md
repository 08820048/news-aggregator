[Magic: The Gathering](https://www.ign.com/games/magic-the-gathering-trading-card-game) is months away from its [Marvel Super Heroes](https://zdcs.link/a56LlN?object_uuid=28f18822-0ee5-40c3-b636-57d843fca437&t=article) set, but you can preorder it right now. Better yet, it’s already seeing a discount at Amazon.

The retailer is offering around [$20 off a Play Booster box of 30 packs](https://zdcs.link/QG8vYB?object_uuid=28f18822-0ee5-40c3-b636-57d843fca437&t=article), meaning you’re getting an awful lot of cards for $189.99 instead of $209.70.

### Marvel Super Heroes Play Booster Box

## Save On MTG’s Marvel Set Before It Launches In June

Doing some quick math, a box of 30 Play Boosters (which each contain 14 cards) would usually mean you’re paying $6.99 per pack. That’s around the standard for Play Boosters in Universes Beyond.

With this deal, though, you’re getting them for $6.33 - not a huge drop, but enough on a per-pack basis to add up, especially if you’d planned on getting a box anyway, or are looking to split one with a buddy or two.

Each pack guarantees you a foil card, but it’s worth noting that whatever the chase alternative art treatments are, there’s a good chance you’ll have better luck finding them in the much, much more expensive Collector Boosters - if you can find them in stock, that is.

UK superheroes, you’re not entirely left out, either. While Amazon UK doesn’t have a traditional discount (at least not yet), [you can get a box of 30 packs for £174.99](https://zdcs.link/a56O1V?object_uuid=28f18822-0ee5-40c3-b636-57d843fca437&t=article) - that’s £5.83 per pack.

The Spider-Man set didn’t land for many of us, but here’s hoping Magic’s next Marvel collab does - expect more card reveals very soon - likely [trampling over Secrets of Strixhaven in the process](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-marvel-reveal-shows-worrying-trend-as-strixhaven-poised-to-be-the-next-edge-of-eternities), sadly.
