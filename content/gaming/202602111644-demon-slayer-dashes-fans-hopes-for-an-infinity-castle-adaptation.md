2026 may be a quiet year for the franchise

## Demon Slayer’s 2026 strategy could frustrate some anime fans

[_Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle_](https://www.polygon.com/demon-slayer-infinity-castle-vs-superman-box-office/) has become the highest-grossing anime film of all time, and fans are hungrier than ever to get more of the popular franchise. At the top of the wish list are [a home release for _Infinity Castle_](https://www.polygon.com/demon-slayer-infinity-castle-streaming-crunchyroll-netflix/) and an official [release window for its sequel](https://www.polygon.com/demon-slayer-infinity-castle-part-2-release-date-rumors/). While the film’s digital rollout is speculated for some time this year, a television adaptation in the vein of the one received by _Mugen Train_ appears unlikely. With all seasons of the _Demon Slayer_ anime set to be rebroadcast in Japan beginning April 5, the series seems focused on revisiting its existing arcs rather than reformatting the record-breaking film for TV.

According to the official [_Demon Slayer_ website](https://kimetsu.com/news/?id=69607&p=1), Fuji TV will air the series weekly, in the same Sunday time slot [_One Piece_](http://www.polygon.com/one-piece-anime-seasonal-26-episodes-end-of-an-era/) used to occupy before the series adopted a seasonal production schedule. Considering the anime has 63 episodes, the broadcast will last roughly until July 2027, meaning that fans won't get to see an eventual TV anime rendition of _Infinity Castle_ until the summer of next year. That's also right around the time the sequel to _Infinity Castle_ is speculated to be released. It's hard to imagine ufotable dividing its resources when a movie of _Infinity Castle_'s level takes so much work.

[_Demon Slayer: Mugen Train_](https://www.polygon.com/demon-slayer-infinity-castle-beat-mugen-train-box-office/) debuted in theaters on Oct. 16, 2020, and the film didn’t arrive on Crunchyroll until June 22, 2021, eight months later. After that, the television adaptation of _Mugen Train_, which added significant scenes from the film, premiered Oct. 10, 2021. When Polygon asked Ufotable co-founder and _Infinity Castle_ [chief writer Hikaru Kondo](https://www.polygon.com/ufotable-hikaru-kondo-demon-slayer-infinity-castle-anime-2025/) whether the film would receive a TV adaptation, he replied that he "cannot answer."

Overall, the broadcast news and the fact that [_Infinity Castle_ is still in theaters in Japan](https://www.polygon.com/demon-slayer-infinity-castle-streaming-release-date-imax-japan/) mean that major new Demon Slayer updates seem unlikely this year, aside from a home release for _Infinity Castle_. This would mark the first year since the anime’s debut for the franchise without releasing a new episode, film, or compilation movie. Although it seems increasingly clear that there won’t be a sequel this year and that production of this magnitude will take time, fans may receive an update sometime after or during the announcement of _Infinity Castle_’s home release date.
