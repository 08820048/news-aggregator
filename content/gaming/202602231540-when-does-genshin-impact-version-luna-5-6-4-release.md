[_Genshin Impact_](https://www.polygon.com/game/genshin-impact/40711/)'s "**Luna 5**" (or better known as 6.4) patch is coming soon, bringing us back to Mondstadt and giving us Varka as a playable character, finally.

Below, we explain when _Genshin Impact_ maintenance starts and ends, alongside the release time of version "Luna 5." We’ve also added some details about what to expect from **_Genshin Impact_ version 6.4**.

## What time does Genshin Impact go down for maintenance?

_Genshin Impact_ will go down for maintenance on **Tuesday, Feb. 24 or Wednesday, Feb. 25** (depending on your time zone) at the following times and will be unavailable for approximately five hours:

-   **2 p.m. PST on Tuesday, Feb. 24** for the west coast of North America
-   **5 p.m. EST on Tuesday, Feb. 24** for the east coast of North America
-   **7 p.m. BRT on Tuesday, Feb. 24** for Brazil
-   **10 p.m. GMT on Tuesday, Feb. 24** for the U.K.
-   **11 p.m. CET on Tuesday, Feb. 24** for western Europe
-   **7 a.m. JST on Wednesday, Feb. 25** for Japan
-   **9 a.m. AEDT on Wednesday, Feb. 25** for the east coast of Australia

Make sure to burn your resin before maintenance starts, if you wanted to, but remember that (as usual) the new battle pass will start after the game comes back from maintenance. You may want to save _some_ of your resin to do some of your weeklies until after this.

## What time does Genshin Impact version 'Luna 5' (6.4) start?

_Genshin Impact_ should come back from maintenance with the "Luna 5" version at the following times:

-   **7 p.m. PST on Tuesday, Feb. 24** for the west coast of North America
-   **10 p.m. EST on Tuesday, Feb. 24** for the east coast of North America
-   **12 a.m. BRT on Wednesday, Feb. 25** for Brazil
-   **3 a.m. GMT on Wednesday, Feb. 25** for the U.K.
-   **4 a.m. CET on Wednesday, Feb. 25** for western Europe
-   **12 p.m. JST on Wednesday, Feb. 25** for Japan
-   **2 p.m. AEDT on Wednesday, Feb. 25** for the east coast of Australia

The servers may come up early or late, depending on how maintenance goes, but these are the approximate times _Genshin Impact_ should go live. Usually, Hoyoverse is pretty good by abiding by maintenance times. We don’t usually get extended maintenance, but it does end early sometimes!

## What’s new in Genshin Impact version 'Luna 5?'

Varka, the Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius, is finally making his playable debut this patch. The Ameno Claymore user will be available this patch for players to pull in the limited banner, to coincide with a return to Mondstadt for some story involving Andrius (the original wolf world boss). The flagship event for this patch is "Homeward, He Who Caught the Wind," which will reward a catalyst weapon skin, "Phantasmal Gift: Star Omen."
