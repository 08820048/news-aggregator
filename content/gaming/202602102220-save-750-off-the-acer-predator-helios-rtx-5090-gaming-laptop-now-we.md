If you're in the market for the most powerful mobile desktop replacement at a not-so-otherworldy price, then check out this limited time deal from B&H Photo. Right now you can pick up the [Acer Predator Helios 16](https://zdcs.link/91wGow?object_uuid=3a27e34f-b2ca-41dc-857f-1bcfce800215&t=article) gaming laptop equipped with an RTX 5090 for just $2,749.99 after a $750 instant discount. The RTX 5090 is still the most powerful GPU you can find in a laptop. Although it's not as powerful as a desktop 5090 GPU, it _is_ roughly comparable to a desktop RTX 5070 Ti GPU.

## Acer Predator Helios RTX 5090 Gaming Laptop for $2750

### Acer Predator Helios 16" OLED Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX RTX 5090 Gaming Laptop (32GB/2TB)

The Predator Helios is Acer's highest end 16" gaming laptop and you'd be hard pressed to find anything (portable) that can beat it in gaming performance. The glossy OLED display features a 2560x1600 (189ppi) resolution with 240Hz refresh rate, G-Sync support, and 100% DCI-P3 color accuracy. The system is equipped with an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor, GeForce RTX 5090 24GB mobile GPU, 32GB of DDR5-6400MHz RAM, and a 2TB SSD. Since this is a newer 2025 model, it also supports the Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4 standards.

### The GeForce RTX 5090 is without doubt the fastest mobile GPU you can get

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 is the most powerful mobile graphics card on the market, performing about 15% better than the RTX 5080. It also has more VRAM (24GB vs 16GB), which can come in handy when playing games at higher resolutions (like on an attached 4K monitor) or if you're planning to use this as a mobile creator or AI workstation. VRAM is in high demand right now, so getting 24GB of GDDR7 in a sub-$3K laptop sounds like a great "deal".

Note that a laptop GPU is not a direct 1:1 performance comparison to its desktop variant. For example, a _mobile_ RTX 5090 is not as powerful as a _desktop_ RTX 5090. Instead, a mobile RTX 5090 is comparable in performance to an RTX 5070 Ti. If you think about it, that makes sense because the mobile RTX 5090 has a TGP of 150W compared to a whopping 575W for the desktop RTX 5090. Shame on Nvidia for using very misleading nomenclature, but whatever the case, you can't really complain about having an RTX 5070 ti equivalent GPU in a gaming laptop.
