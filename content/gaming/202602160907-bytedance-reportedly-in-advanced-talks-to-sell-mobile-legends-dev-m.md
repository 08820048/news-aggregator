TikTok owner ByteDance is allegedly in "advanced talks" to sell Mobile Legends developer Moonton Technology to Savvy Games Group for between $6 billion and $7 billion.

That's according to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bytedance-talks-sell-gaming-unit-moonton-more-than-6-billion-sources-say-2026-02-13/), with sources saying the deal could close by the end of this quarter. The companies have reportedly "reached an initial agreement on \[the\] broad terms of the deal."

Savvy Games [declined to comment](https://www.ft.com/content/27f468d5-84ff-415e-8890-89cc53958535) on the matter, while ByteDance and Moonton did not respond to press request for comment.

This follows reports from last November that [ByteDance was considering selling the Shanghai-based developer](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/bytedance-reportedly-looking-to-divest-mobile-legends-developer-moonton-technology-to-pifs-savvy-games). News of Moonton's sale [began in 2023](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/bytedance-reportedly-planning-to-sell-moonton-technology), two years after [ByteDance acquired the developer in 2021](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/bytedance-acquires-moonton-technology).

Reuters noted that if the deal goes through, it "would mark ByteDance's major retreat from online games."

The company confirmed it was [in discussions to sell its game business in 2024](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/bytedance-confirms-it-is-in-talks-to-sell-games-business), with Tencent marked as a potential buyer.

Savvy Games Group is owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF). The company has stakes in [Nintendo](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/saudi-arabia-increases-stake-in-nintendo-to-708), [Capcom and Nexon](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund-acquires-minor-stakes-in-capcom-and-nexon), Take Two, [Activision Blizzard](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/saudi-sovereign-fund-invests-over-usd3-billion-in-major-game-publishers), and Koei Tecmo.

PIF is part of a group of investors, including Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, that is [acquiring Electronic Arts in a deal valued at $55 billion](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-investors-in-advanced-talks-in-50bn-leveraged-buyout-of-ea).

It will acquire 100% of EA and roll its existing stake in the company.
