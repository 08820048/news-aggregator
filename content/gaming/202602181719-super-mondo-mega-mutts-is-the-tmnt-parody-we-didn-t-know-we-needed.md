Just ahead of the Comics Pro retailer convention, Oni Press has announced a new series called Super Mondo Mega Mutts. As you might have gleaned from the name, the series is a loving homage to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, as well as other mutant animal comics like We3 and Kamandi: The Last Boy on Earth.

IGN can exclusively debut the first preview of Super Mondo Mega Mutts. Check it out in the slideshow gallery below:

Super Mondo Mega Mutts is a four-issue series from writer Curt Pires (Youth) and artist Juan Gedeon (DC: The Jurassic League). Here's Oni's official description of the series:

_One year ago, a fragment of an inter-dimensional civilization collided with Downtown L.A. – creating an impregnable no-man's-land where the laws of physics no longer apply. Convinced that no human being could survive the terrain within, the US government's most morally compromised contractors decided to explore the area codenamed "The Gleam" by sending in four research animals in the hopes of capturing its precious technological wonders. They were hoping to find a new kind of weapon. What they got instead was four radically transformed dogs with minds and a mission all their own. WOLF! FRANKEE! GRIFFY! FREDDY! Together with their brilliant mentor MOJO, the SUPER MONDO MEGA MUTTS are going to bring justice back to the avenues and alleyways where out-of-control federal forces and gangs powered-up by pilfered alien technology now reign. They thought they could put this band of outlaw misfits on a leash... Now the world is going to discover what happens when these mutts BITE BACK._

“It’s been thrilling to watch Oni Press reach new heights the last couple years under the tenure of Hunter \[Gorinson, President & Publisher\], Sierra \[Hahn, Editor-in-Chief\] and the whole team—and I couldn’t be more excited to be bringing them one of my best ideas ever,” said Pires in a statement. “This is a book that is big, bombastic, and heartfelt, one that’s capable of bringing new folks into comic shops—and I’m ecstatic to be creating it with my masterful collaborator Juan Gedeon.”

“Super Mondo Mega Mutts is the kind of book I grew up loving and dreaming about making,” said Gedeon. “It’s loud, weird, funny, and full of heart, with characters you want to protect even when they’re causing chaos. Working with Curt and the team at Oni Press has been a blast, and they’ve given us room to go big and take risks. I’m excited for readers to finally see these dogs unleashed and tearing through the page.”

Super Mondo Mega Mutts #1 will be released in July 2026. You can preorder a copy at [your local comic shop](https://www.comicshoplocator.com/).
