This month is looking to be a treat for anyone interested in the Resident Evil series. In addition to releasing [a new game later this month](https://www.polygon.com/resident-evil-requiem-preview/), Capcom is also running a massive sale on Steam. Called "[Resident Evil Reload Collection Extra](https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/68126/RESIDENT_EVIL_RELOAD_COLLECTION_EXTRA/)," this bundle has all nine mainline games already released, plus two paid DLCs for only $40.

Below you find all the games and DLCs included in the bundle:

-   _Resident Evil 0_
-   _Resident Evil_
-   _Resident Evil 2_
-   _Resident Evil 3_
-   _Resident Evil 4_ (2005)
-   _Resident Evil 5_
-   _Resident Evil 6_
-   _Resident Evil 7: Biohazard_
-   _Resident Evil 7_ - Season Pass
-   _Resident Evil Village_
-   _Resident Evil Village_ - Winter's Expansion

Although it might take a while before you can find the time to go around all the titles featured in this bundle, the price makes it all worthwhile. [_Resident Evil 2_](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/1/22/18192509/resident-evil-2-remake-review/), _Resident Evil 3,_ and _Resident Evil Village_ usually cost $39.99, which is the price you pay for the whole bundle — and the first two, which are remakes of the _RE2_ and _RE3_, are great options to [prepare for _Resident Evil Requiem_](https://www.polygon.com/resident-evil-requiem-re9-games-to-play-before/).

In addition to these three games, the bundle also features all the other important entries. _Resident Evil 7: Biohazard_ is considered by many the title that saved the series. _Resident Evil 0_ and the remake of the first Resident Evil mark the beginning of the series, and both games were only accessible to players who owned a Nintendo GameCube for many years. _Resident Evil 5_ and _Resident Evil 6_ might not be the most critically acclaimed titles, but they expanded the Resident Evil world by taking Chris Redfield to Africa in _RE5,_ and creating a climactic, fan-service focused chapter in _RE6,_ where key figures in the series like Chris and Leon appear in the same game.

The only downside of this bundle (if we can say something like that about a promotion giving 72% discount on so many games) is that it features the original version of _Resident Evil 4_ instead of the remake released in 2023. Even so, considering the number of games that comprise the Resident Evil series — which is hitting its 30th anniversary this year — a bundle like this is extremely helpful if you plan on catching up with what's happening with one of the most famous survivor horror series in history.
