[Mummy](https://www.ign.com/movies/the-mummy-1999) fans, you’ve got a lot going for you right now. [Lee Cronin’s take](https://www.ign.com/movies/lee-cronins-the-mummy) is dropping trailers and visuals left and right, and the film is set to be released in just over two months. On top of _that_, Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz [are returning for a sequel](https://www.ign.com/articles/brendan-fraser-and-rachel-weisz-will-return-for-the-mummy-4) to the beloved 1999 adventure film — and we now have a release date for that project.

According to the official release calendar for Universal Pictures, [the fourth installment in The Mummy franchise](https://www.ign.com/movies/the-mummy-4) — which currently has no official title just yet — [will hit theaters](https://ew.com/the-mummy-4-sequel-starring-brendan-fraser-rachel-weisz-gets-major-update-11904050) on May 19, 2028. It’s a ways away, for sure, but at least there’s a date on the books!

Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, two of the members of the directorial collective and production company Radio Silence, will serve as directors on the project. By now, you know these guys well; they’ve directed two of the three most recent [Scream](https://www.ign.com/movies/scream) sequels, both 5 and 6, and both [Ready or Not](https://www.ign.com/movies/ready-or-not) and its sequel film, which is hitting theaters at the end of next month. They also made one of the best [V/H/S](https://www.ign.com/movies/vhs) segments to date, the finale segment of the original film titled “10/31/98.”

David Coggeshall, the writer behind [Orphan: First Kill](https://www.ign.com/movies/orphan-first-kill), will write the script for the upcoming Mummy sequel film — and it seems as though the plot of the next movie will be fulfilling a dream for Fraser himself.

"The one I wanted to make is forthcoming," he explained to [The Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/brendan-fraser-rental-family-interview-1d3895901593b28eccd6547be8ffbfcc) back in November. "And I've been waiting 20 years for this call. Sometimes it was loud, sometimes it was a faint telegraph. Now? It's time to give the fans what they want."

"The one I wanted to make was never made," he also noted, revealing of the third installment, [Tomb of the Dragon Emperor](https://www.ign.com/games/the-mummy-tomb-of-the-dragon-emperor): "the third one was a model of… how can I say this to the AP reporter? NBC had the rights to broadcast the Olympics that year. So they put two together and we went to China."

After The Mummy was released in 1999, the first sequel titled [The Mummy Returns](https://www.ign.com/movies/the-mummy-returns) debuted two years later in 2001. The third film premiered in 2008, though Weisz did not return for it and was replaced by Maria Bello. Thankfully, though, she’s back and it's hoped she and Fraser will bring the heart and charm of the original right back to this beloved franchise… in 2028, that is.
