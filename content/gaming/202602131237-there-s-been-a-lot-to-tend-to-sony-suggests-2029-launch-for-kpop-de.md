[KPop Demon Hunters](https://www.ign.com/movies/kpop-demon-hunters) fans may have even longer to wait for the smash-hit movie's sequel.

According to [The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/sony-kpop-demon-hunters-2-spider-verse-pressure-3-goat-1236503016/), Sony Pictures Animation co-president Kristine Belson has indicated that [recent reports of a Netflix deal to launch KPop Demon Hunters 2 in 2029](https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-to-see-kpop-demon-hunters-2-until-2029), carried by [Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/news/kpop-demon-hunters-2-2029-release-1236570536/) and [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/kpop-demon-hunters-toys-will-arrive-in-2026-long-after-christmas), may be a little too ambitious.

When questioned over the supposed 2029 date being too far-fetched considering the amount of work a sequel will entail, Belson reportedly responded with a tap of her nose "to indicate that's correct thinking."

While that silent affirmation isn't much, Belson continued verbally to suggest that work on the sequel was yet to really begin, as the first film's huge success on Netflix in late 2025 was still being processed by its creative team.

"There's been a lot to tend to in terms of the award campaign," Belson suggested, before saying that directors Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans would be reconvening soon to look at the franchise's future. "After all the noise and awards and big parties with big people — yes," she continued. "It'll be back to the two of them in a room."

When asked how KPop Demon Hunters 2 would top the first movie, Belson's fellow co-president Damien de Froberville said the studio could look at its popular Spider-Verse franchise for inspiration on broadening its scope and scale.

"On Spider-Verse, I was like, 'How are they going to top Across the Spider-Verse? And then we're looking at art and design \[for 2027's Beyond the Spider-Verse\], and it's really blowing my mind. We look at a lot of art, but what we saw at the last presentation, I'm like, 'Wow.'

"KPop will be the same thing," de Froberville continued. "It's just like Spider-Verse. The world is so rich — the world of the demons and the pop star \[element\], what happened to Jinu. There's so much we could expand into."

Of course, a KPop Demon Hunters sequel is no surprise considering the franchise's first movie is [literally the most popular thing Netflix has ever released](https://www.ign.com/articles/kpop-demon-hunters-is-the-most-popular-netflix-movie-ever), beating even Squid Game, Wednesday and Stranger Things.

If you somehow haven't watched it yet, KPop Demon Hunters is a Sony Pictures Animation film following Korean pop band Huntrix, a trio who are also demon hunters battling against an evil demon king. In our [8/10 review](https://www.ign.com/articles/kpop-demon-hunters-review-netflix), we called it "a stunning animated action musical with terrific fight sequences, catchy musical numbers, and an ample amount of harmony and heart."

Though past reporting has suggested a live-action remake might be in the works, creator Maggie Kang has since [said that the series is best-suited to animation](https://www.ign.com/articles/kpop-demon-hunters-is-one-of-the-biggest-animated-films-ever-but-dont-expect-a-live-action-movie), saying that it's "really hard to imagine these characters in a live action world."
