summary: "18 of the best Nioh 3 skills for the Samurai, Ninja, and Common categories, what those skills do, their locations, and how to increase skill capacity."
---
The **best skills** in _[Nioh 3](https://www.polygon.com/nioh-3/)_ are split into three categories: Samurai, Ninja, and Common. Samurai and Ninja skills can only be used by their respective combat styles, but Common skills can be used by both. Skills are also entirely passive in _Nioh 3_, as opposed to martial arts and ninjutsu, which are active abilities. However, some of these passive skills are also considered to be "Mastery" type, of which you can only equip one at a time.

There are _loads_ to choose from though and most of them require finding the respective Secret Skills Texts in the first place, so you can't just equip them all right from the start. You'll also need to increase your skill capacity to maximize your potential, which we have the details for below. Here are the **best skills in** **_Nioh 3_** that you can find within the first two regions of the game.

## How to increase skill capacity in Nioh 3

    ![The menu with the Sudama merchant in Nioh 3 to buy memorandums.](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/nioh-3-skills-best-memorandums.jpg?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2)Image: Team Ninja/Koei Tecmo via Polygon

Skills in _Nioh 3_ can only be equipped within the constraints of your current skill capacity, unfortunately. This means you have to be _very_ choosy about which skills you use, because you can unlock far more than you can ever equip simultaneously.

You can increase your skill capacity though, and there are a few different ways to do so. Firstly, any "Warrior's Texts," "Samurai's Texts," or "Ninja's Texts" items will increase their respective categories by one (with "Warrior's" referring to the Common category). These can be found all throughout _Nioh 3_, often as rewards from defeating bosses, looting corpses, and opening chests.

Memorandums are also available via the Sudama merchants and for completing all of the exploration goals in each region. However, you'll need four of each respective memorandum to unlock one skill capacity upgrade. These cost two [Yokai Teardrops](https://www.polygon.com/nioh-3-yokai-teardrops-how-to-use-get/) apiece if you buy them from a merchant.
