summary: "We're only partway through February, but it has already given us a year's worth of excellent games. Here's what's worth checking out."

If you haven’t noticed, it’s been a ridiculously busy February for new games. The month started off strong out the gate with _Nioh 3_ and _Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined_, but things really spiraled out of control in the second week of the month. We got new Yakuza, Mario, God of War, Rayman, and High on Life games all within a five-day span — and that was barely scratching the surface. Breakout indies like _Mewgenics_ and _Relooted_ competed for players attention, while niche games like _Tokyo Scramble_ and _Crisol: Theater of Idols_ tried to nab a bit of attention in the cracks.

It’s too much for any backlog to handle. Even if you plan to spend a full weekend doing nothing but gaming, you’d still only get through a fraction of the games released this month. So let us help. Here’s a roundup of what our critics had to say about February’s standout games, organized not by genre or release date, but by incredibly niche categories. May it help you determine what to play this weekend.

## If you love to parry: Nioh 3

Team Ninja’s latest Soulslike is arguably the first truly great AAA game of 2026 so far. It’s a brutal take on _Elden Ring_, applying the bloody basics of the Nioh series to a more open-world game with an emphasis on freeform exploration. In his [review for Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/nioh-3-review/), Ford James praised Team Ninja for its ability to put its own spin on the Soulslike formula: “Team Ninja's third entry to the series is a more accessible open-world Souls game that, at least combat-wise, has more in common with _Sekiro_ than anything else, and is simultaneously a great entry point to the series.”

## If you hate to parry: Romeo is a Dead Man

It doesn’t really matter if a Suda51 game is good or bad: You have to check it out either way. The eccentric developer behind No More Heroes always tends to serve up some kind of genre-pushing action game whenever he steps up to bat, and _Romeo is a Dead Man_ is certainly no different. It’s a balls-to-the-walls blitz of blood and creativity that’s hard to sum up in a blurb. (There’s hack-and-slash action, zombie farming, comic book interludes, and more.) I’ll let [Marloes Valentina Stella’s review](https://www.polygon.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-review/) do the talking: “When this game gets weird, it really gets weird — by the end, you'll consider it perfectly normal to chat with your own bomber jacket while fondling creepy puppets in an abandoned asylum.”

## If you’re young or young-at-heart: Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined

_Dragon Quest 7 Reimagained_ is a remake that will catch you off guard if you’re not paying attention to its title. It’s not a 1:1 remaster of Square Enix’s classic RPG; it completely transforms it into something new. This more kid-friendly take on the notoriously long _Dragon Quest 7_ tones down the length and difficulty while making it look like an animated movie. “That effort makes _Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined_ a call to action,” Mike McWhertor wrote in [his review](https://www.polygon.com/dragon-quest-7-reimagined-review/). “With an infectious enthusiasm, the game beckons a new generation of players to find their inner hero, to save the world through the eyes of those who long for adventure and aspire to make their own destiny.”

## If you miss Newgrounds: Mewgenics

Passion projects don’t get much more unhinged than this. A roguelike over a decade in the making, _Mewgenics_ finds Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel applying the crude humor and deep secrets of _The Binding of Isaac_ into a cat-breeding tactics game that’s hard to put down. “It’s a true feat for a game to walk the line between juvenile and complex, and _Mewgenics_ does it deftly,” Deven McClure writes in [her review](https://www.polygon.com/mewgenics-review-pc/), praising the gonzo project for its seemingly bottomless depth.

## If you just want to play ball: Mario Tennis Fever

The Mario sports series has been in a bit of a lull over the last decade, but _Mario Tennis Fever_ serves up something worthwhile. While its Adventure Mode is a major letdown, rallying has never felt more satisfying thanks to more strategic play and the addition of game-changing Fever Rackets. “_Mario Tennis Fever_ is just a superb tennis game,” Oli Welsh wrote in [his review](https://www.polygon.com/mario-tennis-fever-review/). “It’s riotous without being out of control, easy to pick up without being shallow, devious without being unfair.” So long as you don’t go into it expecting a deep story mode, you’ll find a solid sports game that gets surprisingly competitive.

## If you’re a Tim Robinson stan: High on Life 2

The first High on Life game was a bit of an acquired taste. It was very much a product of _Rick and Morty_ co-creator Justin Roiland, bringing his brand of bumbling humor to a Metroid Prime-like shooter. Roiland is no longer associated with developer Squanch Games, and _High on Life 2_ is ultimately better for it. “_High on Life 2_ is at its best when it's moving away from Rick and Morty and moving towards Ratchet and Clank,” I wrote in [my review](https://www.polygon.com/high-on-life-2-review/), praising its flurry of wildly creative setpieces and fast-paced action. Plus, Tim Robinson reprises his role as Creature for the sequel. _Don’t ya love it?_

## If you love orphans: Yakuza Kiwami 3 & Dark Ties

For my money, _Yakuza 3_ is one of the best games in the Yakuza series. What other game has you spending hours taking care of kids at an orphanage before you can start pummeling bad guys? Developer Ryu Ga Gotoku brings us back to Kiryu’s most earnest adventure with _Yakuza Kiwami 3_, a polarizing remake that makes a lot of changes to the original. “That awkward revision project keeps _Yakuza Kiwami 3_ from matching the series' highs,” Jen Glennon writes in [her review](https://www.polygon.com/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-review/), “but it’s still an enjoyable romp, in no small part thanks to its truly heinous group of villains.”

## If you hate orphans: Reanimal

For _Reanimal_, developer Tarsier Studios took everything it learned about creating small-scale horror with _Little Nightmares_ and turned it up a notch. The atmospheric game about a group of orphans navigating a creepy world is terrifying, even in its quietest moments. “I'm not sure how grateful I am to have been inflicted with claustrophobia, acrophobia, thalassophobia, automatonophobia, and a few other phobias,” writes Marloes Valentina Stella in [her review](https://www.polygon.com/reanimal-review), “but the profound mixture of horror, awe, and sadness I felt by the end of this cinematographic masterpiece makes it worth the struggle.”

## If you want to stick it to the man, man: Hermit and Pig

_Hermit and Pig_ has the kind of one-line pitch that immediately makes you want to play it: It’s an RPG about an old man and his truffle-sniffing pig. Inspired by Earthbound, the indie gem from Heavy Lunch Studio mixes wacky combat with surprisingly brainy writing, as the duo embark on a quest to save a town from an evil corporation. “_Hermit and Pig_ stands out for not making the easy target its focus,” Josh Broadwell writes in [his review](https://www.polygon.com/hermit-and-pig-impressions-earthbound/). “‘Corpo bad,’ yes, but the real standout message is the quiet one about how everyone, even the strange anxious man in the woods, has something to give and can help in small ways. Maybe it won't fix the problem. Maybe it won't even work. But it's something.”

## If you crave justice: Relooted

If you only play one game this month, make it _Relooted_. The stylish heist game doesn’t just offer thoughtful puzzle design and satisfying 2D parkour; it’s also a great history lesson. The game centers around a group of righteous rebels who are out to reclaim stolen African artifacts from rich collectors, museums, and other Western institutions. It’s a sci-fi story, but one rooted in a very real world crisis. “In some ways, _Relooted_ serves as a power fantasy for those who want to liberate the British Museum’s archives, but can’t,” Austin Manchester writes in [his review](https://www.polygon.com/relooted-impressions-xbox-game-pass-recommendation/). With over 60 real-world artifacts to heist, _Relooted_ offers a special kind of digital catharsis that we’ve never seen in a game before.
