How to complete the project

The **Weather Monitor System project in** **_Arc Raiders_** is another permanent project in the game, introduced with the Shrouded Sky update in Feb. 2026. This whole update is about the weather, with the hurricane map condition joining the fray, so this project is focused on keeping track of what's going on with the weather above Speranza.

Completing the Weather Monitor System project has plenty of great rewards, but you need to know what resources to commit each step of the way, and what you'll earn for doing so. Here's a complete guide to all five steps of the _[Arc Raiders](https://www.polygon.com/game/arc-raiders/443837/)_ **Weather Monitor System project**.

## Weather Monitor System resources and rewards in Arc Raiders

As mentioned above, this project is in five stages, each with a different name, and all require different resources. Here's the full list:

### Atmospheric Pressure (Stage 1 of 5)

The first step, as is the case with most projects, is pretty simple.

**Required resources**

**Rewards**

25 Plastic Parts

5 Durable Cloths

15 Metal Parts

5 Great Mullein

5 Arc Alloys

5 Antiseptic

3 Oil

3 Vita Shots

### Sunlight (Stage 2 of 5)

Next up, you'll need to kill one of the new Arc threats to complete this stage.

**Required resources**

**Rewards**

1 Snitch Scanner

10 Processors

3 Wires

5 Advanced Electrical Components

3 Sensors

3 Ziplines

1 Comet Igniter

1 Raider Hatch Key

### Precipitation (Stage 3 of 5)

This one's slightly easier again, although you'll need to hunt for a fair few canisters.

**Required resources**

**Rewards**

5 Arc Powercells

3 Medium Gun Parts

12 Canisters

2 Complex Gun Parts

3 Steel Springs

3 Advanced Mechanical Components

1 Fine Wristwatch

1 Renegade III

### Humidity (Stage 4 of 5)

Again, nothing too painstaking here, just a lot of duct tape.

**Required resources**

**Rewards**

10 Duct Tape

10 Explosive Compounds

3 Rusted Bolts

3 Showstoppers

1 Water Pump

3 Trailblazers

3 Wasp Drivers

1 Extended Barrel

### Temperature (Stage 5 of 5)

Finally, you've gotta take down the other new Arc threat for this one: a Firefly.

**Required resources**

**Rewards**

3 Camera Lenses

1 Medium Shield

1 Damaged Heatsink

5 Surge Shield Rechargers

1 Firefly Burner

3 Sterilized Bandages

3 Voltage Converters

1 Tactical Mk.3 Revival

Completing the whole project will also reward you with 250 raider tokens and a backpack charm in the form of an anemometer. All in all, a little underwhelming compared to the Trophy Display project, but at least you don't need to take down a Queen or Matriarch again.
