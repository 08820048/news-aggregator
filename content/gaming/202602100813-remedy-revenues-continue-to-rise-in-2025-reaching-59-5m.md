Remedy has published its latest financial results, reporting a significant spike in revenue for Q4 driven by increases in royalties and game sales from Alan Wake 2 and Control.

The report also included results for its full fiscal year, experiencing a 17% rise in revenue alongside a €14.9 million operating loss following the underperformance of its multiplayer title FBC: Firebreak.

Here's what you need to know:

## **The numbers**

**Q4 2025**

-   **Revenue:** €17 million (up 46.3%)
-   **Operating profit:** €0.7 million (compared to operating loss of €1.4 million in 2024)

**FY 2025**

-   **Revenue:** €59.5 million (up 17%)
-   **Operating loss:** €14.9 million (compared to €4.3 million in 2024)

## **The highlights**

Remedy reported that rising game sales and royalties formed almost half of its overall revenue for Q4. Major contributors to this increase were royalties from Alan Wake 2 and game sales of Control.

The Finnish developer noted that its improved profitability (compared to a loss during the same period last year) was "driven by the higher revenue level."

2019's Control sold an additional million copies for the full year. Sales were boosted by the announcement of Control: Resonant (previously known as Control 2), which was [unveiled during The Game Awards in December 2025](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/everything-you-need-to-know-from-the-game-awards-2025). The sequel is set to launch this year.

Interim CEO Markus Mäki said early reception to Resonant "has been excellent," with positive player and community sentiment resulting in "positive wishlist numbers."

As for Alan Wake 2, Remedy highlighted that its October feature on PlayStation Plus generated platform-deal royalties during its fourth quarter.

For the full year, the survival horror also continued to accrue "steady royalty generation through unit sales," alongside "steady sales" of other games in the Alan Wake franchise.

Last October, [Tera Virtala stepped down as CEO after nine years](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/remedy-ceo-tero-virtala-steps-down-after-nine-years) with Mäki appointed interim CEO. Yesterday, [Remedy appointed former Electronic Arts VP Jean-Charles Gaudechon as its new CEO](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/remedy-appoints-former-ea-vp-jean-charles-gaudechon-as-new-ceo). He will assume the role on March 1, 2026.

"After a few challenging quarters, Q4 was both positive and profitable. Our single-player games in the market performed well, and the announcement of Control: Resonant was met with a great reception," said Mäki.

Looking at the full year, Remedy attributed the revenue increase to development fees of its Max Payne 1 & 2 remakes and Control: Resonant, royalties from Alan Wake 2, and sales revenue from FBC: Firebreak including subscription service agreements.

Remedy reported overall development fees of €32.9 million, while game sales and revenue amounted to €26.6 million.

In June 2025, the developer launched its first self-published title FBC: Firebreak. The three-player co-op is a spin off from Control.

The title underperformed and did not meet Remedy's expectations, with the developer later saying it had "[hoped for a better launch](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/remedy-says-it-hoped-for-a-better-launch-with-fbc-firebreak)."

Later in the year, [Remedy issued a profit warning](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/remedy-adjusts-fy25-outlook-following-weak-sales-of-fbc-firebreak) due to "weak sales" of Firebreak and recognised a non-cash impairment of €14.9 million. This represented the majority of Firebreak's "capitalised development costs, allocated purchased publishing, and distribution rights."

Remedy adjusted its 2025 outlook as a result, having previously expected both its operating profit to increase from the previous year. Instead it recorded a loss with the non-cash impairment.
