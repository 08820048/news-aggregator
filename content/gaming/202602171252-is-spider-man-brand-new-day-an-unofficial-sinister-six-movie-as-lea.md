Leaked product artwork showcasing several Spider-Man villains has prompted speculation about their involvement in Tom Holland's upcoming Brand New Day.

A banner with designs of Spider-Man, an angry-looking Hulk, plus Spidey villains Tarantula, Boomerang and Scorpion was recently spotted atop the Spider-Man merchandise page of Brazilian retailer [Piticas](https://www.piticas.com.br/homem-aranha). As of today, however, that banner is no longer visible — suggesting it has been removed after sparking a wave of online speculation across reddit and social media.

While not a direct confirmation that these characters will definitely appear in this year's [Spider-Man: Brand New Day](https://www.ign.com/movies/spider-man-brand-new-day), each of the faces on the banner has variously been rumored at certain points as being featured in the film to some degree (and Hulk has essentially been confirmed by actor Mark Ruffalo himself).

Previous reports have also [confirmed the return of Michael Mando as Scorpion](https://www.ign.com/articles/mark-ruffalos-hulk-set-to-return-to-the-mcu-for-spider-man-brand-new-day) (previously seen back in Spider-Man: Homecoming), and [a live-action appearance for Marvin Jones III as Tombstone](https://www.ign.com/articles/marvin-jones-iii-who-voices-tombstone-in-spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-will-play-the-supervillain-in-live-action-form-in-spider-man-brand-new-day) (after previously voicing the character for the animated Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse).

With such a vast array of villains in the movie (without even mentioning [Sadie Sink's mysterious character](https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-4-casts-stranger-things-sadie-sink-to-star-alongside-tom-holland-reportedly-as-either-x-men-favorite-jean-grey-or-mary-jane-watson)), fans are now wondering — is Brand New Day intended to be something of an unofficial Sinister Six movie? The supervillain team has featured a changing line-up over the years, often with more prominent characters. Still, each of the above villains has allied with or been within the team at one point or another.

Discussing the idea of Brand New Day being a Sinister Six movie, fans have suggested the line-up will be reason why Peter Parker needs aid from Punisher in the movie, and why they're having to soothe Savage Hulk to get his help, too. Alternatively, others have wondered if some of these villains will just be cameos, shown during an opening montage recapping Spidey's adventures over the past few years since the events of 2021's No Way Home.

"Thing is the Spidey vs Sinister Six story has become pretty overused and saturated by now," wrote Marvel fan SmaugRancor on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/comments/1r5l4ad/brazilian_official_clothes_site_shows_tarantula/). "We already kinda had that in NWH + Insomniac's Spider-Man + Into the Spider-Verse and now it looks like we'll get something similar here too."

"The Sinister Six for Spidey 6 would be perfect," countered another fan, Jokerfaces2, suggesting that the idea should be used to bring back every major villain from Tom Holland's era in time for his sixth solo outing. "And by then he’ll have a pretty solid lineup of returning villains to form the group. Vulture, Shocker, Mysterio, Scorpion, maybe Kraven for Spidey 5? Then in Spidey 6 someone like Mr Negative or Kingpin assembles them."

Last month, [Cretton described Tom Holland's return in Spider-Man: Brand New Day as a "tonal shift" from the actors' first trilogy](https://www.ign.com/articles/this-is-a-new-chapter-spider-man-brand-new-day-features-a-tonal-shift-from-tom-hollands-first-trilogy), and a "new chapter" of Peter Parker's story. The movie is expected to show the consequences of Spider-Man's real identity being forgotten by the wider world — separating him from ex-girlfriend MJ and best friend Ned. At the same time, Holland will have to deal with several new threats, including whoever Sadie Sink is portraying.

Fans are still waiting for the film's first full trailer, though [what appeared to be grainy footage of an upcoming Spider-Man: Brand New Day teaser hit the internet](https://www.ign.com/articles/apparent-spider-man-brand-new-day-trailer-leak-seemingly-drops-strong-hint-at-sadie-sinks-character) just before Christmas, featuring dialogue that positioned Sink as portraying a villain — initially, at least. "You're a mess, Spider-Man," Sink's character can be heard to say. "Don't get in my way. Otherwise, it won't just be your friends who don't remember who Peter Parker is."

Spider-Man: Brand New Day arrives in theaters on July 31.
