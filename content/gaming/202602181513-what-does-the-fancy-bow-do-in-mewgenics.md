The **Fancy Bow** is the greatest mystery in [_Mewgenics_](https://www.polygon.com/game/mew-genics/3325/). Whereas most items tell you exactly what they do when you click on them, the Fancy Bow will just tell you "it's fancy," and nothing more. Still, as a beautiful pink headpiece, it looks great on your cats.

If you'd like to obtain this fashionable item, here's where to find the Fancy Bow and how to (potentially) use it in _Mewgenics_.

## How to get the Fancy Bow in Mewgenics

You'll be given the Fancy Bow when you **donate a kitten to Tink** for the first time. This should happen shortly after you've completed The Alley and unlocked The Sewers. While your neighbors Frank and Butch will ask for retired and battle-hardened cats, respectively, Tink only accepts kittens, which includes all newly born cats (under the age of two).

To find Tink, open the map and click on his icon in the bottom right corner. To donate a kitten, select one and click the small pipe icon in their profile. If the cat is suitable for donation to Tink, you'll see his head next to the pipe icon.

## How to use the Fancy Bow in Mewgenics

At the time of writing, the true purpose of the Fancy Bow (if there is one) has not been discovered. Though we equipped the Fancy Bow on various cats throughout many battles, it didn't create any effects. The Fancy Bow may, of course, be a purely cosmetic item, but as Tink hints, "It may seem useless now, but in the right light, the color is just to die for." Perhaps it won't always be useless, then.

[As the developers said](https://www.polygon.com/mewgenics-dlc-secret-unlock-arg-binding-of-issac/), it will take months or even years to discover every secret in _Mewgenics_, so there's a good chance the Fancy Bow has a secret use. Our best guesses are that it may be part of a secret item combo or larger "fancy armor" set, or perhaps a character may ask for it in a future update. It's therefore highly recommended to hold on to it; dump your cats if you must, but never your Fancy Bow!
