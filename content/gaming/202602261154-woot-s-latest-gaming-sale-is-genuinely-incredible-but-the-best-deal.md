Amazon’s Woot store has been known to offer a bunch of deals in the past, but it might just have outdone itself this time around with its [brand new "Video Games For All!" sale](https://zdcs.link/ak1K2w?object_uuid=a944803f-fa31-4c6b-a3d8-11fa60396c86&t=article).

Not only is the retailer offering discounts on games like 2025 hits Monster Hunter Wilds and Pokémon Legends Z-A, but it’s got a handy "LEVEL20" discount code that makes them _even_ cheaper. But, there's a limited time left to take advantage, as the promo code will expire by 11:59 PM CT on February 27.

That LEVEL20 promo code makes games like [Monster Hunter Wilds just $13.59](https://zdcs.link/QW6w3A?object_uuid=a944803f-fa31-4c6b-a3d8-11fa60396c86&t=article) (just wow!). Perfect for testing out the latest performance enhancements on all platforms and taking on the latest endgame content.

Legends Z-A, on the other hand, [is just $35.92 on Switch 1](https://zdcs.link/QrJXRm?object_uuid=a944803f-fa31-4c6b-a3d8-11fa60396c86&t=article). IGN's Rebekah Valentine gave the game an 8 out of 10 [in her review last year](https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-review), saying “Pokémon Legends: Z-A finally feels like Game Freak hitting its stride in Pokémon’s 3D era, with a fun setting to explore, a well-written story, and a total battle system overhaul that works surprisingly well.”

You can upgrade to the Switch 2 version digitally as well for just $10 after making your purchase, making this a certified bargain.

It’s not just newer titles, either. Elden Ring, heralded as one of the greatest games of all time ([IGN awarded it a 10 out of 10 in our review](https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-review)), is just [$15.99 on PS5 with the discount code](https://zdcs.link/a07n5E?object_uuid=a944803f-fa31-4c6b-a3d8-11fa60396c86&t=article) as well.

Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which is getting Switch 2 features next month, [got a 9 out of 10 review score from IGN](https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-bros-wonder), is [down to $37.59 with the promo code](https://zdcs.link/aoJXw0?object_uuid=a944803f-fa31-4c6b-a3d8-11fa60396c86&t=article).

[Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 are just $47.19](https://zdcs.link/QLp810?object_uuid=a944803f-fa31-4c6b-a3d8-11fa60396c86&t=article) for the pair, while if you’ve not played Breath of the Wild yet, [it’s $35.19](https://zdcs.link/QqJwPD?object_uuid=a944803f-fa31-4c6b-a3d8-11fa60396c86&t=article). That's just the tip of the iceberg as well, as there's some unbelievable discounts all round.
