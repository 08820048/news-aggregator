While [_The Mandalorian & Grogu_'s Super Bowl trailer](https://www.polygon.com/star-wars-the-mandalorian-and-grogu-superbowl-trailer-disappointment/) didn't quite deliver what [Star Wars](https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/) fans were looking for, Lego is here to save the galaxy. Several new _The_ _Mandalorian & Grogu_ builds have been revealed, offering hints at what's to come in the movie. That said, the best one is clearly the Grogu-sized starship that's built for Anzellans ([Babu Frick](https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2020/3/20/21187241/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-babu-frik-maz-kantata-behind-the-scenes-interview-neal-scanlan/)'s species). It's tiny and only fits either an extra-small Anzellan or Grogu minifigure. No Mandos allowed.

Lego revealed a total of seven sets tied to [_The Mandalorian & Grogu_](https://www.polygon.com/mandalorian-jon-favreau-difference-star-wars-tv-movies/) that include a variety of vehicles and characters we'll be seeing in the movie. And yes, that means there are so many more Grogu minifigures about to invade the world, as they're included in four of the seven builds.

A synopsis for _The Mandalorian & Grogu_ reads, "The evil Empire has fallen, and Imperial warlords remain scattered throughout the galaxy. As the fledgling New Republic works to protect everything the Rebellion fought for, they have enlisted the help of legendary Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) and his young apprentice Grogu."

The biggest takeaway is the Razor Crest, Mando's ship that we saw destroyed in season 2 of [_The Mandalorian_](https://www.polygon.com/the-mandalorian/) by Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito). It looks as though it's been rebuilt with those bright yellow accents, and we have an idea of how that was done. You might remember that Din Djarin and Grogu replaced the Razor Crest with a modified N-1 Starfighter — the Royal Naboo Security Service's fighters in _The Phantom Menace_. Mando teamed with Peli Motto (Amy Sedaris) to rebuild it.

While Mando's N-1 was silver, the bright yellow details on the resurrected Razor Crest look as if they were pulled directly off an old Naboo fighter, making us wonder if Motto has some other old N-1s lying around that she and her team of droids can make use of.

While the speeder sets might seem to be teasing the return of Cobb Vanth (Timothy Olyphant), both of these sets look to be pulled from previous seasons of the show. Grogu is wearing his old outfit, while Cad Bane is included in the Vanth set — and he's very dead.

All seven of the new sets go up for preorder Feb. 14 through [Lego's website](https://www.lego.com/en-us/categories/coming-soon). They will be released on April 26. The Mandalorian and Grogu hits theaters on May 22.
