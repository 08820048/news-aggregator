Vendetta's still a monster, too

## Every new Overwatch hero just got nerfed (except one)

A few days after dropping [five new heroes](https://www.polygon.com/overwatch-2026-new-heroes/) into [_Overwatch_](https://www.polygon.com/overwatch/), Blizzard pushed a small patch live with balance adjustments for everyone. Everyone gets nerfed, except Emre, and Anran gets some welcome buffs for her general damage output _and_ a slight adjustment to how her Fan the Flame damage interacts with armor (it's more important than it might sound).

At the top of the list is Domina, though Blizzard is, for now, leaving her primary fire's exceptional range untouched _and_ keeping the perk that extends that range. It'll just be easier to take down panels from her barrier shield now. Some folks noted that a Blizzard developer left a comment in one of _Overwatch_ streamer Emongg's videos that they made another change to Domina, one that isn't in the patch notes. The change stops her crystal charge from restoring shields if it damages a deployable object, like another Domina's shield, and it doesn't count self-healing toward Domina's ultimate charge. Polygon was unable to find that comment, but after testing it in-game, those changes do seem to be present.

Other important updates include increased explosion range for [Emre's excellent grenades](https://www.polygon.com/overwatch-season-1-best-new-hero-emre/) and further fall-off damage distance when he's aiming down sights. That should make eliminating flying characters like Jetpack Cat a bit easier. Anran's primary fire deals more damage now, and _Overwatch_ treats her Fan the Flames damage like a beam attack. That means armor only reduces damage from it by 30%, which should make wearing down sturdier opponents a bit easier.

Speaking of Jetpack Cat, [her (counter-able) ultimate](https://www.polygon.com/overwatch-jetpack-cat-ultimate-cancel-counter/) remains untouched. She just has less fuel now. And Vendetta's lifesteal perk was bumped down to 30% instead of 40%.
