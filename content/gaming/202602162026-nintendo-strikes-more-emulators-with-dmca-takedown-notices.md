Nintendo has issued a fresh batch of Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) notices to several emulators using repositories on GitHub.

As spotted by [PC Gamer,](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/they-can-never-kill-emulation-players-vexed-as-nintendo-continues-its-siege-on-switch-emulation-handing-dmcas-to-various-emulators-on-github/) emulators like Citron, Eden, Kenji-NX, MelonNX, Pine, Pomelo, Ryubing, Ryujinx, Skyline, Sudachi, Sumi, Suyu, and Yuza were all [notified](https://www.reddit.com/r/EmulationOnAndroid/comments/1r32zz6/comment/o51du26/) by GitHub that they'd been hit with a DMCA takedown notice.

An [email](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fswitch-emulators-got-hit-with-dmca-notice-v0-u70xjiizb4jg1.png%3Fwidth%3D1435%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D6e3dcda2e5304d39be9a96eb7701e558393d1f35) from GitHub Trust & Safety said it is "never \[its\] desire or goal to take down open-source projects, but instead to help developers address DMCA concerns with their projects," and outlined some options.

The recipient was then given one business day to respond; failure to do so would result in the repository being disabled.

"It is true, but nothing major," wrote Eden developer maufeat on Discord, addressing users. "Our release repo got the notice, so you will probably have to download future releases and nightlies directly from us.

"Most of them are forks which was just a matter of time to get a DMCA notice on GitHub. But this is why we (and other emulators) don't host the source on GitHub."

It follows legal action by Nintendo against similar sites like [Yuzu](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-files-lawsuit-against-yuzu-emulator-creators) and [Tropic Haze](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-files-lawsuit-against-yuzu-emulator-creators), and last year, [Nintendo banned Switch 2 players from using its online services after using the MIG Switch](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-reportedly-bans-players-using-mig-cartridges-for-pirated-games-on-switch-2), a flash cartridge that can store pirated game files.

[Nintendo has also recently revised its Account Agreement and Account Privacy Policy to tighten the rules on emulation and piracy](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/switch-consoles-can-be-made-permanently-unusable-if-nintendo-thinks-a-player-has-broken-new-user-agreement).
