As part of the **"[Pokémon Go](https://www.polygon.com/game/pokemon-go/38713/) Tour: Kalos"** event, players who pay $9.99 for the event pass will get a Special Research task that forces them to pick between X or Y. You'll get a Xerneas or Yveltal as a reward for completing the steps, depending on which you pick, with one option being better than the other, depending on what kind of gameplay you like.

Below, we explain **whether you should pick the X or Y path in the "An X-ceptional Yarn" Special Research**, as well as the steps for the research.

* * *

## Should you pick X or Y in the 'An X-ceptional Yarn' Special Research?

Note that in this research, you'll get a **Xerneas or Yveltal with a Special Background**, as well as an **X- or Y-themed medal**, based on your choice. That being said, you can (and should, in my opinion) **pick the Pokémon you like the most**. Whichever one you don't get from this research, you can totally get from raids during the "Go Tour: Kalos" event anyway.

If you don't have much time to play during the "Go Tour: Kalos" event, and you want to know what the **PvE meta pick is, it's Yveltal**. Yveltal is a very strong flying-type attacker for raids and gyms, and though Xerneas is also a strong fairy-type attacker, Yveltal trumps it in damage-per-second overall. That being said, if you _need_ a flying-type attacker, you should pick Yveltal, and if you _need_ a fairy-type attacker, you should pick Xerneas.

**If you love PvP, on the other hand, Xerneas is the better pick**, as it's [currently #4 on the Master League rankings](https://pvpoke.com/rankings/all/10000/overall/xerneas/). Yveltal is also a decent pick for PvP ([sitting at #17 in the Master League](https://pvpoke.com/rankings/all/10000/overall/yveltal/)), but Xerneas is just better. Thems the facts.

**Rewards**: Unown X/Y encounter, 12 Unown Candy

If you picked X, you'll need to power up a fairy-type, and you'll get Swirlix, Clauncher, and Unown X. If you picked Y, you'll need to power up a dark-type, and you'll get Spritzee, Skrelp, and Unown Y.

## 'An X-ceptional Yarn' step 5 of 5
