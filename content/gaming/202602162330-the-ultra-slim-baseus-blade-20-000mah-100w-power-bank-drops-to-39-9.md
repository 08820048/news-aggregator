## Baseus Blade 20,000mAh 100W Slim Power Bank for $39.99

[![Baseus Blade 20,000mAh 100W Slim Power Bank](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/baseusbladepowerbank-1754512128752.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/91wgdx?object_uuid=8917d819-2677-4775-a243-32856fb6a7c2&t=article "Baseus Blade 20,000mAh 100W Slim Power Bank")

### Baseus Blade 20,000mAh 100W Slim Power Bank

The Baseus Blade measures only 0.7 inches thick. Most high-capacity power banks are well over 1" in thickness. The Blade achieves this slim depth by going with a wider body design. The form factor allows it to fit perfectly in a laptop bag or backpack sleeve. It still weighs in at about one pound which is comparable to other power banks, so no give or take there.

The wide body allows it to squeeze in four ports: two USB Type-C ports each with 100W of Power Delivery and two USB Type-A ports each with 30W output. Note that the maximum charging output is 100W. That means although all three ports add up to a total of 160W, only a maximum of 100W will be delivered across all three ports if they are used simultaneously.

### The 20,000mAh capacity can fully recharge your gaming handhelds

This Baseus Blade boasts a generous 20,000mAh, or 74Whr battery capacity. If you factor in 80% power efficiency, here are the approximate number of times you can fully recharge each gaming handheld or iPhone model:

-   Nintendo Switch 2 (18Whr) about 3.3 times
-   Steam Deck (40-50Whr) about 1.2-1.5 times
-   ROG Xbox Ally (60Whr) about 1 times
-   ROG Xbox Ally X (80Whr) about 0.7 times
-   Lenovo Legion Go S (55Whr) about 1 time
-   Apple iPhone 17 (14Whr) about 4.2 times
-   Apple iPhone 17 Pro Max (20Whr) about 3 times

### The 100W output can fast charge nearly all phones and gaming handhelds

The Baseus Blade has USB Type-C ports that provides up to 100W of power output but it will automatically throttle down to whatever maximum rate the plugged-in device accepts. The Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 can only accept a maximum of 18W-30W of power output. The Steam Deck can accept up to 45W. The Legion Go S accepts up to 55W. The Xbox ROG Ally X can actually accept charging rates of up to 100W.

### This power bank can be brought onto airplanes

You don't need to worry about being stopped at airports. The 20,000mAh 74Whr capacity is well below TSA's 27,000mAh/100Whr carry-on limit, so you are safely in the clear.
