Tonight's PlayStation State of Play broadcast has featured a full reveal for [Project Windless](https://www.ign.com/games/the-bird-that-drinks-tears), a single-player action RPG [long in development at the Montreal studio set up by PUBG publisher Krafton](https://www.ign.com/articles/pubg-publisher-krafton-acquires-the-ascent-developer-prepares-new-studio-launch-in-canada).

Krafton Montreal Studio, as the developer is simply called, is led by Patrik Méthé — a former Ubisoft veteran who served as a game director on Far Cry 3, Far Cry 4, Far Cry 5, Far Cry: New Dawn and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Extraction.

Since late 2022, Méthé has been Head of Studio at Krafton Montreal and creative director on Project Windless, an open-world action RPG take on Korean fantasy novel series The Bird That Drinks Tears.

Designed for players new to its storytelling world and built in Unreal Engine 5, today's trailer clearly seeks to position the game as an entry point for a fresh audience, and impress with AAA production values.

One notable feature is its large-scale battles, powered by the game's so-called Mass Technology, which allows for war-like scenarios with thousands of participants.

"From the start, we asked ourselves what it really means to play a legendary figure in a fantasy world," Méthé said. "For us, that meant giving players real agency, not just in combat, but in how wars unfold, how alliances are formed, and how history is written. Project Windless is built around the idea that legend is not something you observe, it is something you actively create through play."

Krafton is best known for publishing PUBG: Battlegrounds, as well as the Dead Space spiritual successor The Callisto Protocol, and the Sims-like InZOI.
