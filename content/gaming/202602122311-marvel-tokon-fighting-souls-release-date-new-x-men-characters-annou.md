Arc System Works announced new characters and a release date for their upcoming fighting game, Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls. The Unbreakable X-Men join the character roster, and the final game will be released for PS5 and PC on August 6.

Wolverine, Storm, Magik, and Danger join the roster as the Unbreakable X-Men, including Wolverine's tank-like moves in which his claws can have armor on them. The fighter will also include an Episode Mode that, according to producer Takeshi Yamanaka, "blends American comics and Japanese manga into a new form of storytelling adapted for a modern video game format" in a story presented via motion comics.
