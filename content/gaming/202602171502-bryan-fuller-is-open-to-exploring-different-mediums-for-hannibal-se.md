Hannibal season 4 is too delicious to pass up

## 'I’m not giving up': Bryan Fuller is exploring a Hannibal revival — just not in TV

[_Hannibal_](https://www.polygon.com/best-hannibal-episode-sakizuke/), the grimdark psychological horror from _Pushing Daisies_ and [_Dead Like Me_](https://www.polygon.com/deadllikemebryanfullerstreamingfree/) creator Bryan Fuller, enraptured fans from the moment it debuted on NBC in 2013. The series follows the empathetic but troubled FBI profiler Will Graham (Hugh Dancy) and the cunning forensic psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter (Mads Mikkelsen), who is also a cannibalistic serial killer. The unlikely bond between the two men kickstarts a journey of murder and love, which was cut short when the series was canceled after season 3 due to [low viewership](https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/a/kristen-kim/nbc-hannibal-canceled). But like an all-you-can-eat buffet, Hannibal’s fandom is still hungry for more story, and Fuller, who has never given up trying to get a [season 4](https://www.polygon.com/hannibal-season-4-bryan-fuller-hugh-dancy-mads-mikkelsen/) off the ground, is eager to provide.

In his latest interview with Polygon, he made it clear he was considering other media beyond TV to explore _Hannibal_ season 4.

It’s been 11 years since the shocking finale, which featured Will embracing Hannibal to pull him off a cliff to their presumed deaths after the pair finished murdering brutal family-killer [Francis Dolarhyde](https://www.polygon.com/bryan-fuller-interview-dust-bunny-hannibal/) (Richard Armitage). That should have been it for Will and Hannibal, but fans [haven’t given](https://www.reddit.com/r/HannibalTV/comments/1p490cd/possibility_of_season_4/) [up](https://www.reddit.com/r/HannibalTV/comments/1mntb1r/seriously_just_make_an_animated_season_4/) on a [potential _Hannibal_ season 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/HannibalTV/comments/1o8fup4/what_would_season_4_have_looked_like/). And they aren’t the only ones: [The cast](https://www.gaytimes.com/television/hannibal-creator-says-everybodys-in-for-season-4-heres-the-holdup/?st_source=ai_mode#:~:text=here's%20the%20holdup-,Hannibal%20creator%20says%20%E2%80%9Ceverybody's%20in%E2%80%9D%20for%20season%204%20%E2%80%93%20here's,\)%2C%20Caroline%20Dhavernas%20\(Dr.) of _Hannibal_ is raring to go, too, though Dancy has expressed concern about the [cast's aging and the time limits](https://collider.com/hannibal-season-4-hugh-dancy-comments/) on when the revival could happen.

_Hannibal_’s [murky rights issues](https://www.polygon.com/hannibal-season-4-bryan-fuller-hugh-dancy-mads-mikkelsen/) have been the major barrier to _Hannibal_ season 4, but Fuller has never been shy about wanting to find a way to continue Hannibal and Will’s story, even as he works on other projects, like his feature-film directorial debut, [_Dust Bunny_](https://www.polygon.com/dust-bunny-brings-best-of-hannibal-and-bryan-fuller-to-the-silver-screen/). Speaking to Polygon via Zoom, he considered alternative ways to get _Hannibal_ season 4 out there.

One alternative: an audio drama. “There’s something appealing about an audio story, because we could bring the actors back, and even if they were sitting in a recording studio with headphones, it would still be those actors,” Fuller says. “It would still be Lawrence Fishburne. It would still be Gillian Anderson, Hugh, and Mads.”

That might not be the way some _Hannibal_ fans would like to envision the continuation of a TV series where the blood-soaked visuals are so key to its identity. But the audio route would directly address Dancy’s concerns that he and Mikkelsen [might age out of the roles](https://collider.com/hannibal-season-4-hugh-dancy-comments/).

Fuller acknowledges that the rights to some _Hannibal_ characters, in particular, are still in flux following the death of Martha De Laurentiis in 2021. But if _Hannibal_ continues, he’s adamant that his vision includes the full cast returning, including ragebait journalist Freddy Lounds (Lara Jean Chorostecki), burnt-to-a-crisp Dr. Frederick Chilton (Raúl Esparza), and the infamous “Murder Wives,” Margot Verger (Katherine Isabelle) and Alana Bloom (Caroline Dhavernas).

“There is a regathering and a reordering of where those rights will land,” Fuller says. “And it may be easier to do a _Silence of the Lambs_ story that weaves in those characters and the story in a way that actually sets them up for a bigger story that can be organic, and might not have to navigate all of the rights.” Fuller didn’t clarify how that would be possible, but it isn’t the first time he has mentioned adapting material related to Thomas Harris’ novel _The Silence of the Lambs._ Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, he previously said he wanted to [cast Zendaya](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/hannibal-creator-zendaya-silence-of-the-lambs-tv-show-1236367635/) as Clarice Starling, the no-nonsense FBI trainee who gets entangled in Hannibal’s web.

Fuller acknowledges that his Hannibal actors are aging, but he doesn’t see that as a barrier to his plans yet. “There’s something about the nature of the next step of Will and Hannibal's relationship that could happen now, that could happen five years from now, and we would still be able to tell the same story, because of the nature of what the season 4 story is in my mind,” he says. “So yes, a time limit, but it's not any time soon. I’m not giving up.”
