Instead of paying for expensive sports tickets and fighting the crowds, why not put that money into a big, gorgeous TV set so you can watch from the comfort of your home. Woot - which is owned by Amazon - just kicked off the best high-end big-screen TV deal I've seen for Presidents Day.

Woot is currently offering the massive [77" Samsung S90D 4K OLED Smart TV](https://zdcs.link/aN3MJV?object_uuid=17c670c4-a82d-40ec-9a43-43ec9512f385&t=article) for just $1,497.99. Shipping costs just $5, although if you're a Amazon Prime member then the fee is waived. This matches a similar deal I saw during Black Friday. Note that this is a **brand new** TV with a 1 year Samsung warranty.

### 77" Samsung S90D 4K OLED Smart TV

OLED TVs feature best-in-class image quality thanks to their near-infinite black level, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response time. For most use cases, there isn't a better TV that you can get for the same price.

The S90D is Samsung's 2024 S90 series TV. This is a higher end model that's equipped with a quantum dot (QD) OLED panel, which is brighter and boasts a wider color gamut than traditional W-OLED panels like Samsung's lower end S85 series. It is a slightly older model than the current generation [Samsung S90F](https://zdcs.link/ak13dg?object_uuid=17c670c4-a82d-40ec-9a43-43ec9512f385&t=article) that was released in 2025, but that TV currently costs $500 more and image quality is practically identical. It's comparable to LG's C-series OLED TVs.

OLED qualities aside, the Samsung S90D also has all the features you'd want in a [gaming TV](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tv-for-gaming). It has a native 120Hz panel that can be pushed to as high as 144Hz as well as four total HDMI 2.1 ports for [running 4K](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-high-end-4k-tv) at 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X gaming console. The S90D also supports variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode

## Is this a good TV for the Nintendo Switch 2?

Despite being a current generation console, the [Nintendo Switch 2 has lax TV requirements](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tv-for-nintendo-switch-2) compared to the PS5 or Xbox Series X. When the Switch is connected to its dock and a television, it is only capable of outputting a 4K resolution signal at up to 60 frames per second. It can go up to 120fps if the resolution drops to 1080p, but the data rate required for both these options is pretty much the same. Oddly, it doesn’t even get VRR when docked – that’s [reserved for handheld mode](https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-the-switch-2-will-only-support-vrr-in-handheld-mode) only. The Switch 2 console, however, will still benefit greatly from the Samsung's gorgeous OLED panel.
