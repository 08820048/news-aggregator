Amazon's latest attempt to gain a foothold in games, 2025's multiplayer co-op game show [_King of Meat_](https://www.polygon.com/game/king-of-meat/443280/), has failed. Developer Glowmade and publisher Amazon Game Studios confirmed Monday that _King of Meat_ will shut down in April, and that players who purchased the game will receive full refunds.

"Despite the creativity and innovation Glowmade brought to _King of Meat_, the game has unfortunately not found the audience we hoped for," Amazon Game Studios said in a statement on the [_King of Meat_ website](https://www.kingofmeat.com/en-us). "As a result, we have made the difficult decision to conclude our investment in the game, and _King of Meat_'s servers will close on April 9, 2026. Players will be able to access and play all existing content until then, so we encourage you to enjoy your remaining time in the game with your fellow Contenders."

_King of Meat_'s closure likely won't come as a surprise to players, or anyone who's paid attention to Amazon's game output over the past decade. While the game received mostly positive reviews on Steam — critics were more harsh, based on aggregate review data from [OpenCritic](https://opencritic.com/game/19197/king-of-meat) — _King of Meat_ peaked at 320 concurrent players there. Based on our hands-on experience with the game at launch, console players didn't show up either.

"I dove in on PlayStation 5 across its maiden weekend and was very rarely able to matchmake with enough players to get a full four-player team going," Polygon's Giovanni Colantonio wrote in our [early impressions of _King of Meat_](https://www.polygon.com/king-of-meat-launch-day-impressions/). "I came back on launch day proper and had an even tougher time finding even one teammate. Things don’t seem too promising on Steam either, where the game currently has 58 reviews at the time of writing, pulled from the game’s five days of early access."

_King of Meat_ is the latest casualty at Amazon, which last month confirmed that its once-hot MMO [_New World: Aeternum_ would shut down for good in 2027](https://www.polygon.com/new-world-aeternum-shutting-down-delisted-offline/). Before that, Amazon Game Studios tried and failed with games like [MOBA-inspired shooter _Crucible_](https://www.polygon.com/2020/5/19/21262721/crucible-moba-free-to-play-steam-impressions-amazon-new-game-shooter/) (which [unlaunched](https://www.polygon.com/windows/2020/6/30/21308665/crucible-closed-beta-release-amazon/) weeks after its release) and [sports-fantasy brawler _Breakaway_](https://www.polygon.com/2016/12/16/13986442/breakaway-amazon-game-studios-playable-alpha-test-pc/) (which lasted a little longer). Amazon also [canceled an in-development Lord of the Rings MMO](https://www.polygon.com/22391970/lord-of-the-rings-mmo-amazon-game-studios-canceled/), and has mostly found success in publishing other companies' MMOs, like Smilegate's _Lost Ark_ and NCSoft's _Throne and Liberty_. Amazon still has a different Lord of the Rings MMORPG in the works, as well as other untitled projects and a pair of Tomb Raider games.

Glowmade and Amazon unveiled _King of Meat_ in 2024 at [Gamescom Opening Night Live](https://www.polygon.com/gamescom/442015/gamescom-announcements-trailers-onl-2024/) and released it the following year on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X.
