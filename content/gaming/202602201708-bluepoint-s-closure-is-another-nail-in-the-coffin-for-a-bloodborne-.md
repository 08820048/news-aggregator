Maybe we're out of luck

## Sony just put another nail in the coffin of a Bloodborne remake

One of the most requested video game remakes in history is undoubtedly _Bloodborne_, FromSoftware's 2015 PlayStation 4 hit. Adjacent to the renowned Dark Souls series, it focused almost exclusively on offensive playstyles, allowing the player to dual-wield weapons, but largely forgoing the option of shields. _Bloodborne_ was so good, we considered it to be "some of the best work FromSoftware's ever done" in our [review](https://www.polygon.com/2015/3/27/8209199/bloodborne-review-PS4-playstation-4-exclusive/).

That was 11 years ago, and an entire console generation later, fans of the gothic horror game have been clamoring for a remake. A remake — or remaster, for that matter — would improve the locked 30fps performance, add native 4K support, and speed up loading times considerably, among other quality of life and visual enhancements. Lance McDonald, a renowned video game modder, released a third-party [60 fps mod for _Bloodborne_](https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/9/22274434/bloodborne-60-fps-patch-mod-ps4/) on modded PS4s, proving it's possible. Emulation software like [ShadPS4](https://shadps4.net/), which lets PS4 games run on PC, has given some FromSoftware fans the modern visuals a remake would deliver.

However, anyone still clinging to the idea of a _Bloodborne_ remake coming soon may be out of luck. Sony is closing developer Bluepoint Games, the studio responsible for a number of remakes and remasters, including the PlayStation 5 launch title _Demon's Souls_, plus _Shadow of the Colossus_ and _Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection_ on PS4. Roughly 70 Bluepoint employees will lose their jobs as a result.

Bluepoint Games, given its track record and how impressive _Demon's Souls_ on PS5 was (seriously, we called it "a classic reborn" in our [review](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/11/13/21564203/demons-souls-ps5-review-remake-bluepoint-games-playstation-5/)), was the logical choice to lead development on a _Bloodborne_ remake. That studio understands what goes into modernizing a Souls game, especially how crucial it is to nail the finer details and retain both the spirit and feel of the original.

However, following its co-development work on _God of War Ragnarok_, Bluepoint was allegedly working on a live-service God of War game that eventually got canceled in 2025. According to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-19/sony-is-shutting-down-the-playstation-studio-bluepoint) reporter Jason Schreier, the studio "spent the last year pitching and trying to determine what it would do next." Unfortunately, the answer didn't end up being a _Bloodborne_ remake, and it looks like it never will.

Is there another studio out there that could handle such a prestigious project? Sure, but it wouldn't come with quite the same pedigree that one would with Bluepoint behind it, because Bluepoint was the [gold standard](https://www.polygon.com/interviews/2020/10/29/21539158/demons-souls-ps5-remake-changes-sixth-archstone-world-tendency/) when it comes to remakes. Virtuos and QLOC are both credited on _Dark Souls Remastered_, so they could be contenders. Bloober Team did a great job with the _Silent Hill 2_ remake, while Toys For Bob handled the _Spyro Reignited Trilogy_. Then there's Aspyr, which has a long track record, but one that also has plenty of ups and downs.

Neither Sony nor FromSoftware has ever made public comment about a potential _Bloodborne_ remake, and one definitely isn't entirely off the cards, despite Bluepoint's shuttering. FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki has acknowledged the demand, though. In a 2024 interview with IGN, he said he has "a lot of great memories for that game," and when speaking with Eurogamer, he elaborated by saying "it does make me very happy to see that there are still so many people passionate about it." However, a _Bloodborne_ remake seems considerably less likely now in the wake of Bluepoint’s closure, which is a crying shame.
