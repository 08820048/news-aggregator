Bethesda boss Todd Howard has confirmed that [Starfield](https://www.ign.com/games/starfield) is _not_ getting a huge 2.0-type update.

At the end of last year, [a cluster of Starfield fans said they'd gained an early glimpse at improvements coming to Bethesda's sci-fi role-player](https://www.ign.com/articles/temper-expectations-bethesda-reportedly-prepping-starfield-improvements-though-suggestion-is-this-isnt-a-cyberpunk-20-scale-update). One saying they were "stoked" by what they saw, while another suggested they were "excited for the future of Starfield."

However, another fan tempered expectation by stressing that the changes are relatively modest in scope, adding that this "probably isn't a [Cyberpunk 2.0-scale update](https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077)," referencing the major additions that helped improved CD Projekt's RPG.

And now Howard, too, is dampening anticipation by similarly stressing this is "not Starfield 2.0."

“Obviously, we’ve been working on a lot of Starfield content. I can tell everybody we are going to be talking about \[the new content\] really soon,” Howard told [Kinda Funny](https://youtu.be/sX4rKpB97L4), as transcribed by [Kotaku](https://kotaku.com/starfields-next-big-update-isnt-a-2-0-reboot-its-for-people-who-already-love-the-game-2000670749). “We’re moving into a phase where we’re ready to talk about Starfield. And really show that in the right way, and what’s coming to the game. We’ve been doing a lot of work that we like a lot.”

Howard added: "You know, I’ve seen some of that, so for expectation-setting, I think it’s the kind of thing where if you love Starfield, we think you’re going to love this. It’s updates and things that change the game, not in an isolated way, but sort of meta. Using outer space and things in ways that we haven’t."

Interestingly, he also candidly stressed that ​​"if Starfield is something that didn’t connect with you right away, or you bounced off it, or found it boring in places, I don’t think this is going to change that fundamentally."

Though Howard was coy about timelines, he did say we may find out more "soonish."

In August it was [reported that Bethesda had delayed Starfield's second expansion](https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-reportedly-set-for-ps5-release-during-spring-2026-alongside-new-expansion) due to "weak sales" of its first, Shattered Space, which launched in September 2024 to a 'Mostly Negative' Steam user rating. Todd Howard had [previously talked of Starfield expansions releasing annually](https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared). Another reported reason for the delay was Bethesda's plans to launch Starfield on PS5, with both the second expansion and the game's multiplatform rollout potentially happening simultaneously.

Fast-forward to earlier this month, and a new Microsoft report suggested [Starfield was getting new content soon, and it looks like we’ll shortly hear about that heavily rumored PlayStation 5 version, too](https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-3-remaster-reportedly-still-in-active-development-new-starfield-content-out-soon).
