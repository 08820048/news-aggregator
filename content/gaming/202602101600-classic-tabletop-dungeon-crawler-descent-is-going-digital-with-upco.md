Fantasy Flight’s 2005 board game _Descent_ helped establish the [dungeon crawler](https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/482201/maladum-dungeons-enveron-heroquest-dungeon-crawler/) board game genre, replicating the tactical experience of playing [_Dungeons & Dragons_](https://www.polygon.com/dnd-dungeons-dragons/) but with less roleplaying and more focus on immersion through detailed maps and miniatures. While the first two versions of _Descent_ required one person to run the game as the Overlord, Fantasy Flight removed that job in 2021 with [_Descent: Legends of the Dark_](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22617353/descent-legends-of-the-dark-review-app-driven-board-game-rpg/), which used a companion app to manage the monsters, traps, and narrative events. Now Artefacts Studio is going a step further, turning _Descent_ into a video game.

Releasing sometime this spring, _Terinoth: Heroes of Descent_ will feature an original story set a year before the events of _Legends of the Dark_. Up to four players can control a party of four heroes as they explore dungeons and fight in turn-based battles. Just like in the board game, you’ll have to carefully consider where your characters are positioned, take advantage of the terrain, and make the most of each hero’s powers to be victorious.

_Terinoth: Heroes of Descent_ has a full campaign spread across 20 dungeons, though groups can also opt to play standalone quests. The game even allows new players to drop in mid-crawl. There are eight adventurers to choose from, each with their own combat style, and your party composition also changes how NPCs react and how you can interact with the environment. Between delves, you’ll upgrade your equipment and level up your abilities.

Playing the _Descent_ board game can be a lot of fun, but it also requires an enormous gaming table and significant setup time. _Heroes of Descent_ trades the tactile satisfaction of moving around monsters on 3D terrain for voice acting and slick animation for spells and attacks. Artefacts Studio has plenty of experience with faithful tabletop adaptations, having created the digital version of [_Terraforming Mars_](https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/22751449/best-board-games/) and worked with Cyanide on [_Space Hulk: Tactics_](https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/9/17956100/space-hulk-tactics-preview-pc-ps4-xbox-one/). Their latest game looks perfect for players who want to share the fun of dungeon crawling together, but don’t necessarily have the time or room for a regular in-person game night.

The first demo of _Terinoth: Heroes of Descent_ is available to play now on Steam. The game will be released this spring on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X.
