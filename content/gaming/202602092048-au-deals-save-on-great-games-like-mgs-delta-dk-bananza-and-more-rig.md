If there is a theme running through my game deals of today, it's confidence without chaos. Games that know exactly what they are, respect your time, and quietly reward commitment rather than demanding obsession. I've played almost all of these, and in every case the discounts meaningfully shift the value conversation. So get amongst 'em before they're gone.ContentsRetroNintendoXboxPlayStationPCLEGOThis Day in Gaming 🎂In crusty gamer news, I’m summoning sweary imps to bake a 14-shaped cake for The Darkness II. Though I didn't adore this as much as the non-cel-shaded, Starbreeze Studios original at launch, how could I not greedily devour any game starring Jackie Estacado, the best “dark hero” this side of Spawn. Basically, this was a power fantasy of an FPS where akimbo pistoles held as much importance as your heart-eating demon tentacles and black hole conjurations. Also, the idea of having Jackie tell us gruesome mobster factoids during loading screens? Absolute chef’s kiss.Aussie birthdays for notable games.- Psychonauts (PC,XB) 2006. Get- Rugby 06 (PC,PS2,XB) 2006. eBay- The Darkness II (PC,PS3,X360) 2012. GetNice Savings for Nintendo SwitchPokemon Pokopia (-23%) - A$85 Similar to Animal Crossing, Pokopia looks set to offer a chill experience where you gradually learn and utilise Pokémon abilities to create a Xanadu for yourself and your fellow Pokemans.Donkey Kong Bananza (-19%) - A$89 Classic platforming confidence with just enough modern polish. Still built around timing and momentum, and still happiest when you stop overthinking jumps.Dragon Quest Treasures (-53%) - A$40.20 A lighter, loop driven take on the series that trades epic scale for constant forward motion. Charming, repetitive, and best enjoyed in short, deliberate sessions.Celeste (-75%) - A$7.50 Still the gold standard for fair difficulty. Every death teaches something, every retry feels earned, and the emotional beats land without ever slowing the climb.Crysis Rem. Trilogy (-60%) - A$30 A technical flex turned historical artefact. The ideas still hold up, even if the shooting occasionally reminds you how far design has moved on.Or gift a Nintendo eShop Card.Back to topExciting Bargains for XboxCrash Bandicoot 4 It’s About Time (-45%) - A$55 Tighter and more demanding than nostalgia suggests. Brilliant level design, but it expects precision and will happily punish sloppy muscle memory.Like a Dragon Ishin! (-69%) - A$30.80 Familiar systems in historical dress, delivered with confidence. The combat is serviceable, but the real joy is watching the studio indulge itself without apology.Borderlands Leg. Col. (-80%) - A$17.90 An absurd amount of shooting for the money. The humour is uneven, but the loot loop remains dangerously effective if you enjoy numbers going up.Atomic Heart (-70%) - A$32.30 Visually striking and mechanically inconsistent. Worth seeing for the world alone, even if the moment to moment play never fully settles.Streets of Rage 4 (-65%) - A$13.10 Still one of the cleanest modern beat em ups. Tight inputs, readable chaos, and a soundtrack that does more work than it needs to.Xbox OneDigimon Survive (-72%) - A$20.60 More visual novel than tactics game. Slow, wordy, and occasionally brilliant if you are here for tone rather than constant interaction.Shovel Knight Treasure Trove (-60%) - A$22.90 A masterclass in restraint. Tight controls, smart callbacks, and expansions that respect the original without diluting it.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater I + II (-56%) - A$30.80 Muscle memory comes roaring back. The remake understands exactly what to modernise and what to leave untouched.Or just invest in an Xbox Card.Back to topPure Scores for PlayStationGran Turismo 7 (-41%) - A$73.30 Still meticulous to a fault. The experience on PS VR2 is peerless, but progression systems remain oddly hostile to anyone without endless patience.Tekken 8 (-48%) - A$44 Aggressive, readable, and finally welcoming without dumbing down. A rare fighter that rewards newcomers without losing its edge.No Man’s Sky (-29%) - A$49.30 The redemption arc is real. Systems now stack cleanly, exploration feels purposeful, and the sense of scale still quietly impresses.Visions of Mana (-45%) - A$54.40 Colourful and earnest, sometimes to a fault. Combat shines when it flows, but the pacing assumes you are happy to linger.Death’s Door (-75%) - A$7.40 A compact action adventure with real bite. Simple on the surface, quietly emotional underneath, and respectful of your time.PS4Two Point Hospital Jumbo Ed. (-48%) - A$28.40 Management chaos with a dry sense of humour. Systems stack fast, and it shines once you stop trying to play efficiently.Trials of Mana (-44%) - A$43.20 A faithful remake that values vibe over reinvention. Combat is breezy, story is earnest, and expectations should be calibrated accordingly.Sonic Superstars (-70%) - A$28.40 Fast when it works, frustrating when it does not. Momentum is king, and patience is required when physics disagree with intent.Or purchase a PS Store Card.Back to topPurchase Cheap for PCMetal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater (-50%) - A$58.40 A respectful rework of a classic that still feels wonderfully strange. The pacing is deliberate, and that is part of the appeal.Stellar Blade (-45%) - A$76.90 Slick combat and immaculate animation carry it far. The challenge curve is honest, but the tone will not be for everyone.Doom The Dark Ages (-71%) - A$35.30 Familiar aggression with heavier armour. It rewards confidence, punishes hesitation, and never pretends subtlety is the goal.Death Stranding Dir. Cut (-75%) - A$13.70 Finally feels complete. Meditative, occasionally obtuse, and deeply committed to its own rhythm.Dredge (-65%) - A$12.70 Cozy fishing with a creeping sense of dread. The loop is simple, the atmosphere does the heavy lifting, and it lingers longer than expected.Or just get a Steam Wallet CardBack to top Adam Mathew is a passionate connoisseur, a lifelong game critic, and an Aussie deals wrangler who genuinely wants to hook you up with stuff that's worth playing (but also cheap).
