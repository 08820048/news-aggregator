The **_Arc Raiders_** **"Stable Housing" quest** was added to the game with the Shrouded Sky update, and requires you to visit everyone's favorite underground facility, Stella Montis, on behalf of Tian Wen. This _[Arc Raiders](https://www.polygon.com/game/arc-raiders/443837/)_ quest needs to be completed in one round and all you know when you enter is that you need to go to the Security Bridge, however you'll quickly hit a hurdle when you need to find an alternate way into the safe.

Here's a **complete walkthrough for "Stable Housing" in _Arc Raiders_**, including where to find the safe and everything you need to know to get inside it.

## 'Stable Housing' quest steps in Arc Raiders

Here are all seven quest steps for "Stable Housing" in _Arc Raiders_ (don't forget everything must be completed in one round):

1.  Go to the Security Bridge.
2.  Search for the safe in the side room by the third-floor staircases.
3.  Head upstairs to the fourth-floor control room.
4.  Use the Access Card Printer to print a key to the safe.
5.  Search for alternate ways into the safe.
6.  Retrieve the contents of the safe.
7.  Deliver the Project Heartwood Blueprints to Tian Wen.

Here's how to complete all of the above and get your hands on the Project Heartwood Blueprints.

## Where to find the safe in the side room by the third-floor staircases

    ![The left-hand side of the image shows the player character in front of the Stable Housing safe in Arc Raiders while the right-hand side of the image shows the location on the in-game map.](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/arc-raiders-stable-housing-safe-location.jpg?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2)Graphic: Ford James/Polygon | Source images: Embark Studios via Polygon

First up, head to the Security Bridge. This location is marked on your map so it's easy to locate, and if you're familiar with Stella Montis, you'll know Security Bridge to be the four-story tower where each room requires breaching before you can enter.

Go to the third floor — indicated by the enormous number three on the wall by the staircase — and enter the side room behind the stairs' banisters. In the back-right corner of the room, you'll find the safe.

## Where to find the fourth-floor control room

Next up, you need to head to the fourth-floor control room and use the Access Card Printer, which is located directly above you. Head up the stairs and into the same room on the fourth floor, then use the printer.

## How to find an alternate way into the safe

    ![The player standing in front of the notice board which holds the alternate way into the safe for the Stable Housing quest in Arc Raiders.](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/arc-raiders-stable-housing-notes.jpg?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2)Image: Embark Studios via Polygon

Unfortunately, the printer breaks when you try to use it, so you need to find a different way into the safe. Head back down to the third-floor room, where the safe is, and as soon as you enter, look to your right. You'll be able to inspect the notice board, which has an alphanumeric code written down (because of course it does). Your character will learn the code, so turn around, interact with the safe again, and Bob's your uncle: the safe is open and you can pick up the Project Heartwood Blueprints.

You need to get these safely to Tian Wen, so if you have a safe pocket, these should be placed inside. If not, hightail it to the nearest extraction point as quickly and safely as you can.
