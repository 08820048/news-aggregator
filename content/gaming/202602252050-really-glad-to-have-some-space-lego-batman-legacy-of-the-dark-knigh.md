Rockstar's most recent [GTA 6](https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi) delay might mean a longer wait for the year's biggest launch, but it also brought relief to other developers previously set to release games in the same timeframe.

That includes TT Games, the storied British studio behind numerous LEGO titles such as LEGO Star Wars, LEGO Harry Potter, and the promising-looking [LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight](https://www.ign.com/games/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight).

Due to launch for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on May 29 (with a Nintendo Switch 2 edition to follow on later), the open-world Gotham action adventure is now set to launch within days of Rockstar's previous GTA 6 date — May 26.

TT Games made its [Legacy of the Dark Knight release date announcement](https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-release-date-announced-the-game-awards-2025) last December at The Game Awards, a month after Rockstar's latest GTA 6 delay was made public. (GTA 6 now looks to have a seemingly-final launch date, with marketing set to ramp up this summer ahead of its long-awaited arrival on November 19.)

"We knew we wanted to come out in spring of this year," TT Games Head of Production and Strategic Director Jonathan Smith told IGN in a recent interview, discussing the "space" now opened up by GTA 6's delay to this holiday.

"Look, I want to play that game \[GTA 6\], but we're also really glad to have some space for people to play Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight. We're giving you an open city and a fantastic experience for all players. Which I thoroughly recommend."

Going hands-on with the game last year, [IGN came away impressed](https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-is-the-arkham-game-youve-been-waiting-for-gamescom-2025), saying that "LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight was the Arkham Game you've been waiting for."
