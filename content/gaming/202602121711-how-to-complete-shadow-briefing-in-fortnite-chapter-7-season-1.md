**Shadow Briefings** are mini-challenges that are scattered all over the map in _[Fortnite](https://www.polygon.com/game/fortnite/2417/)_.

There are two different types of Shadow Briefings in Chapter 7 Season 1 — **Supply Drop** and **Plunder**. Both briefings give you gold bars as a reward, but only if you can complete their challenges within the five-minute time limit.In Chapter 7 Season 1, Shadow Briefings have received a new look, and there are a _ton_ of Shadow Briefing spawn locations on the map, but they're not guaranteed to spawn every game. You've definitely come across a few in your games, but you may not have noticed because they've reverted to their old Chapter 4 look.Here's **how to complete Shadow Briefings in _Fortnite_ Chapter 7 Season 1** and where you can find them.

## Shadow Briefing locations in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1

Shadow Briefings are just about everywhere on the _Fortnite_ Chapter 7 Season 1 map, but, as they've reverted to their original look, there's a good chance that you walked by them without realizing. Rather than their secretive briefcase appearance in previous chapters, Shadow Briefings have gone back to looking like **job boards**.

We recommend **landing on the bottom half of the map** as there are a lot more possible spawn locations. Here are some of the best locations to land:

-   Vineyards south of Lethal Labs
-   Cosmic Durr (restaurant northwest of Classified Canyon)
-   Ripped Tides
-   Bumpy Bay

Additionally, every gas station has a possible spawn location, so if you'd like to take your time with the quest, you can land near them or pick up a challenge when you're refilling your car.

## How to complete Shadow Briefings in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1

After you've found a Shadow Briefing, you'll notice that the job board will say either **Supply Drop** or **Plunder**. This dictates what kind of challenge you need to complete.

    ![A Supply Drop marked on the map in Fortnite.](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/supply-drop_fn.jpg?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2)Graphic: Johnny Yu/Polygon | Source images: Epic Games via Polygon

For **Supply Drops**, you'll need to, well, find and interact with the Supply Drop within the time limit. After you interact with the Shadow Briefing, a **Supply Drop icon appears on your map**, which notes where the crate will eventually land. It does take a little bit of time to touch down, but we recommend getting a car and speeding over. Once you find and interact with the Supply Drop, you'll receive your gold bars and complete the Shadow Briefing.

For **Plunder**, you'll need to find buried chests and dig them up within the time limit. Rather than a pinpointed location, two circular areas will appear on your map. When you make it to one of the circles, you need to look for a sparkling pile of dirt and hit it with your pickaxe to reveal a chest. Search the chest and repeat the entire process in the second area to complete the Plunder Shadow Briefing.
