Todd Howard promises more Skyrim, less Fallout 76 and Starfield

## The Elder Scrolls 6 will return to classic Bethesda style

In an [interview with Kinda Funny Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX4rKpB97L4), Todd Howard gave a long-awaited update on [_The Elder Scrolls 6_](https://www.polygon.com/game/the-elder-scrolls-6/40514/)'s development progress. No, he didn't mention a release date (besides "not this week"), but Bethesda's studio head and creative director promised a return to the classic style that shaped [_The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim_](https://www.polygon.com/game/the-elder-scrolls-5-skyrim/1789/).

"If you look at our games, we've sort of always evolved. We do have a certain style that we like, and our fans like, that we want to get better and better at," said Howard. "In some ways, in many ways, [_Fallout 76_](https://www.polygon.com/game/fallout-76/40362/) and [_Starfield_](https://www.polygon.com/starfield/) are a little bit of a creative detour from that kind of classic Elder Scrolls or Fallout \[game\]."

As examples of Bethesda's classic games, where players explore the world in a similar way, Howard names _Skyrim_, [_Fallout 3_](https://www.polygon.com/game/fallout-3/3795/), [_Fallout 4_](https://www.polygon.com/game/fallout-4/38395/), and [_Oblivion_](https://www.polygon.com/game/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion/4597/). "As we come back to _The Elder Scrolls 6_, that we're doing now, we're coming back to that kind of classic style that we've missed and that we know really, really well," he said.

Howard currently spends most of his time on _The Elder Scrolls 6_, as do most of the studio's developers. That includes more than 250 people, some of whom aren't new to working on The Elder Scrolls games. "The majority of the folks who made _Skyrim_ are actually still here," said Howard.

Howard mysteriously announced that the team is about to hit a "big milestone" in _The Elder Scrolls 6_'s development, though he doesn't disclose its nature. He also said that the team has "spent the last several years bringing Creation Engine 2, which powers _Starfield_, up to Creation Engine 3, that's going to power _The Elder Scrolls 6_ and beyond."

Although it's been seven years since [_The Elder Scrolls 6_ was announced](https://www.polygon.com/e3/2018/6/10/17447854/elder-scrolls-6-announcement-e3-2018-launch-date-ps4-xbox-one-pc/), development updates have been scarce. So far, we know that [it will arrive before _Fallout 5_](https://www.polygon.com/23167994/fallout-5-todd-howard-elder-scrolls-6/), and that [Bethesda did a big play test](https://www.polygon.com/elder-scrolls-6-tes6-update-todd-howard/) in late 2025. Todd Howard says this early announcement wasn't his choice, as he would much prefer that "You hear nothing, and then one day, the game is out."

The only other development update Howard can give at this time is that it's going well, but "It's going to be a while yet."
