summary: "Here's the correct order to watch the Spider-Man movies, chronologically and by release date."
---
Spider-Man is one of the most iconic superheroes of all time, but he didn’t swing onto the big screen until director Sam Raimi helped bring 2002’s Spider-Man to life. Since then, Spider-Man has become one of the most profitable superheroes, with pretty much every film adaptation taking the box office by storm.

While it may be easy to watch the films in release order, there are those of us who love watching stories in chronological order to experience these stories in a whole new way. Luckily, the release order and chronological order of the Spider-Man movies and spin-offs are the exact same, so it really just comes down to how you want to watch all the films that tell the complete story of the Spider-Verse (pun intended!).

Below, you can find a mostly spoiler-free look at **how to watch all the Spider-Man movies and their spin-offs in chronological order.** You'll also see a few lists on Spider-Man movies in release order or with a particular actor. And if you want to just find out how to watch the Spider-Man spin-offs like Venom and Kraven and the like, check out [Sony's Spider-Man Universe in Chronological Order](https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-spider-man-universe-in-order).

## **How Many Spider-Man Movies Are There?**

While the wider Spider-Man Universe includes over a dozen movies, there are **ten total films** led by Spider-Man himself. Eight of those movies are live-action — three led by Tobey Maguire, two by Andrew Garfield, and three by Tom Holland — and two are animated, featuring a variety of Spideys.

For a full list of how to stream all of the films, take a look at our guide on [where to watch the Spider-Man movies in 2026](https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-stream-spider-man-movies-online).

## **Spider-Man Movies in Chronological Order**

### 1\. Spider-Man (2002)

[

2002’s Spider-Man is the one that brought Peter Parker into the world of live-action on the big screen. Starring Tobey Maguire as everyone’s friendly neighborhood Spider-Man and Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane, this film gave us many memorable moments, including the upside-down kiss that may still be one of the most iconic kisses of all time.

Oh, and it features Willem Dafoe and his fantastic first performance as Harry Osborne/Green Goblin and J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, roles they would both reprise in future films beyond the Maguire-era.

### 2\. Spider-Man 2 (2004)

[

Tobey Maguire’s journey as Spider-Man continues in 2004’s Spider-Man 2, and this time he must face off against Alfred Molina’s Doctor Otto Octavius when a tragic lab accident turns the Doctor into a supervillain. This second film in the Maguire era took place two years after the first and gave us the legendary scene featuring Spider-Man saving a runaway train with nothing but his spider-strength and web-slinging prowess.

### 3\. Spider-Man 3 (2007)

[

](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/06/23/spider-man-3-1280jpg-7f75a8-1655920834910-1655994176942.jpg)

Spider-Man 3 is the last film of Sam Raimi’s trilogy and the final entry starring Tobey Maguire as the titular hero. Whereas the first two films focused on one main villain, this third entry packed three baddies into its runtime, including Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), Venom (Topher Grace), and a new Green Goblin (James Franco). This movie, which takes place about a year after Spider-Man 2, is probably the most polarizing of the first three films, but it did give us Spider-Man’s Black Suit and that must give it some points, right?!

### 4\. The Amazing Spider-Man (2012)

[

](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/06/23/amazin-spider-man-1655920834910-1655994176941.jpg)

2012’s The Amazing Spider-Man saw Marc Webb swing into the director’s chair, and was the first to star Andrew Garfield as the web-slinging hero opposite Emma Stone’s Gwen Stacy. The Amazing Spider-Man is another take on Spidey’s origin story and features some history about Peter’s parents. The big bad in this movie is Rhys Ifans’ Lizard, a mutated scientist who once worked with Peter’s father.

### 5\. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014)

[

](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/06/23/amazing-spider-man-2-1655920834909-1655994176941.jpg)

The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was the second and last film in the Garfield era and, much like the last film in the original Spider-Man trilogy, it featured a trio of villains. like. Taking place two years after the original, this sequel introduced Jamie Foxx’s Electro, Paul Giamatti’s Rhino, and Dane DeHaan’s Green Goblin, and was supposed to set up future entries in the franchise featuring Venom and the Sinister Six. Unfortunately, the film’s mixed review and lower box office performance contributed to all of those plans being scrapped.

### 6\. Captain America: Civil War (2016)

[

](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/06/23/civil-war-1655920834909-1655994176941.jpg)

While Captain America: Civil War is obviously not a Spider-Man movie, it did introduce the world to Tom Holland’s version of Spider-Man. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) recruits Holland’s Peter Parker after he has already become Spider-Man, and we get to see him facing off against or teaming up with many of the MCU’s greatest heroes.

### 7\. Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)

[

](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/06/23/homecoming-1655920834909-1655994176940.jpg)

Spider-Man: Homecoming, Tom Holland’s first solo film as Spider-Man, arrived in 2017 with Jon Watts at the helm. It takes place after the events of Captain America: Civil War, and tells the story of Peter Parker handling the twin challenges of high school and proving to Tony Stark that he’s ready to join the Avengers. Despite that, he still takes it upon himself to improve his skills and stop crimes as Spider-Man alongside hanging out with his friends MJ (Zendaya) and Ned (Jacob Batalon). Homecoming also introduces us to Michael Keaton’s Adrian Toomes/Vulture, a villain who will appear again down the line.

### 8\. Venom (2018)

[

](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/06/23/venom-1655920834908-1655994176939.jpg)

While there is no Spider-Man in 2018’s Venom, Tom Hardy’s version of the iconic Spidey villain does have a role to play in Holland’s Spider-Man story as future films will see their paths almost cross. It remains to be seen if Holland’s Spider-Man will ever actually run into Hardy’s Venom, but this character will undoubtedly have an important part to play in the future of the web-slinger, one way or another.

### 9\. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018)

[

](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/06/23/spider-verse-1655920834908-1655994176939.jpg)

Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is another Spider-Man story separate from the mainline films, but it is one well worth a watch. The story centers around Shameik Moore’s Miles Morales, but Spider-People from many different multiverses quickly enter the picture and build a cast of characters, including Hailee Steinfeld’s Spider-Gwen, Jake Johnson’s Peter B. Parker, John Mulaney’s Spider-Ham, Nicolas Cage’s Spider-Man Noir, and more.

### 10\. Avengers: Infinity War (2018)

[

](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/06/23/infinity-war-1655920834908-1655994176939.jpg)

Avengers: Infinity War features a large cast of the MCU’s greatest heroes, and Tom Holland’s Spider-Man is one of them. He plays an important role in Infinity War and his growing friendship with Tony Stark is one of the highlights.

### 11\. Avengers: Endgame (2019)

[

](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/06/23/endgame-1655920834907-1655994176938.jpg)

While certain plot reasons keep Tom Holland’s Spider-Man out of Avengers: Endgame for much of the movie, he still makes his presence felt in key moments of this film’s story. Also, it is the culmination of 21 MCU films before it and deserves a spot on the watch list.

### 12\. Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019)

[

](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/06/23/far-from-home-1655920834909-1655994176938.jpg)

Taking place after the events of Avengers: Endgame and dealing with much of what happened in that film, Spider-Man: Far From Home begins in New York City before taking Holland’s Peter Parker to Europe for a school trip. He wants to take a trip undisturbed from the world of superheroes, but the universe has other plans for him. Throughout Far From Home, Holland crosses paths with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), and Quentin Beck (Jake Gyllenhaal), who claims to be a hero from a different universe. Make sure to stick around for the post-credits scene here!

### 13\. Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021)

[

](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/06/23/venom-let-there-be-carnage-blogroll-1632947813148-1655920834907-1655994176937.jpg)

Much like the first Venom film, Venom: Let There Be Carnage is very much adjacent to the Spider-Man films rather than directly tied in. However, this film builds up the world of Tom Hardy’s Venom, and includes a post-credits scene that brings these two worlds closer together than ever.

### 14\. Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)

[

](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/06/23/no-way-home-1655920834906-1655994176936.jpg)

Spider-Man: No Way Home picks up right after the post-credits of Spider-Man: Far From Home and is the most recent mainline Spider-Man film to be released. After Peter and his friends’ lives are turned upside down, he goes to Doctor Strange and asks him to make things right by making everyone forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.

However, things go awry and the multiverse opens up, bringing many familiar faces from previous films into the MCU. No Way Home is as much the next chapter in Holland’s story as it is a continuation of the Maguire and Garfield eras, and the fan service is just so wonderful, especially if you have seen the previous films.

### 15\. Morbius (2022)

[

](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/06/23/morbius-1655920834906-1655994176934.jpg)

Morbius, much like Venom, has very little in the way of Spider-Man specifically, but it helps build out the wider universe. We know Morbius takes place in the same universe as Venom as there are certain nods like a reference to the events “in San Francisco,” but the connection to Spider-Man is a bit more unknown. Morbius is a Spider-Man villain, and the film also sees the return of Michael Keaton’s Vulture, who looks to have a bigger role to play in the future of Spider-Man, hinting that Morbius could take place in the MCU or Sony or even a bit of both.

### 16\. Spider-Man: Across the Spiderverse (2023)

[

](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/10/17/spidermanacrossthespiderversereview-blogroll-1685535068711-1697563405199.jpg)

Across the Spider-Verse is another animated film that seemingly sits outside of the MCU. That being said, it dives deep into the multiverse and could eventually be pulled into the rest of the Spider-Man universe similar to how the other films were brought into the fold with No-Way Home. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a direct sequel to Into the Spider-Verse, taking place about a year after the last film ended.

The film is largely centered around Miles Morales getting pulled further into the multiverse to join Gwen Stacy and a team of Spider-People to take on a powerful new threat.

### 17\. Madame Web (2024)

[

](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/21/madamewebending-blogroll-1707956740146-1716313167409.jpg)

While the Spider-Man spin-off Madame Web is connected to our favorite web-slinging hero, the events of the film don't feature him. Sure, [there may be some spoilery links we won't ruin here,](https://www.ign.com/articles/madame-web-ending-explained-post-credits-tom-holland-spider-man-connection) but this is a mostly standalone story in the Spidey-verse that you can watch at any time.

This film stars Dakota Johnson as Cassandra Webb and tells her origin story. We follow her as a paramedic in Manhattan who begins to develop powers to see the future and and tries to come to grips with trying to change what's to come. She is joined by Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, and Celeste O'Connor, who are all "bound for powerful destinies... if they can all survive a deadly present."

### 18\. Venom: The Last Dance (2024)

Tom Hardy had his last go-round as Eddie Brock, as well as Venom, in 2024's Venom: The Last Dance. Our review said "Venom: The Last Dance trips over its own tendrils and lets a boring, generic plot, and bad action distract from the surprisingly resilient central relationship between Eddie Brock and his symbiote bestie."

### 19\. Kraven the Hunter

The Aaron Taylor-Johnson-starring Kraven the Hunter didn't fare well with critics, and appears to be the last live-action movie for now in the Sony/Marvel universe. And just think, none of these guys ever even got to meet Spider-Man!

## Upcoming Spider-Man Movies

Following the release of Kraven the Hunter, [Sony's Spider-Man Universe appears to be on hold](https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-spider-man-universe-reportedly-done-as-kraven-the-hunter-targets-opening-worse-than-madame-web), at least in terms of live-action movies not starring Tom Holland as Spidey. In fact, I think most folks assumed the Sony Spider-verse was dead. However, Sony has recently confirmed they're planning [a full reboot](https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-plans-to-reboot-wider-spider-man-universe-after-kraven-madame-web-and-morbius-failures) of "their side" of the Spidey franchise. No word on what exactly that will entail, but thankfully we have some confirmed Spider-Man movies coming our way.

### Beyond the Spider-Verse

The third Spider-Verse movie, Beyond the Spiderverse, is [in development](https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-beyond-the-spider-verse-gets-june-2027-release-date-first-photos-revealed). While originally slated to release in 2024, we got official confirmation at CinemaCon that the new release date is June 4, 2027.

Nic Cage will also be continuing in his Spider-Verse role as Spider Man Noir for a [live action Amazon series](https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-noir-live-action-series-is-coming-to-amazon) from producers Phil Lord, Chris Miller, and Orien Uziel.

### MCU Spider-Man

Tom Holland's Spider-Man will continue in the MCU with [Spider-Man: Brand New Day](https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-brand-new-day-release-date). It's scheduled to release on July 31, 2026, with Destin Daniel Cretton (Shang-Chi) on board as director. Sadie Sink (Stranger Things) recently joined the cast; [she'll reportedly play](https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-4-casts-stranger-things-sadie-sink-to-star-alongside-tom-holland-reportedly-as-either-x-men-favorite-jean-grey-or-mary-jane-watson) either X-Men character Jean Grey or Mary Jane Watson. Jon Bernthal will also be [reprising his role](https://www.ign.com/articles/jon-bernthals-punisher-will-be-in-spider-man-brand-new-day) as the Punisher.

Outside of those two movies, other updates include Kevin Feige confirming [Miles Morales won't appear in live-action](https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-has-told-marvel-to-stay-away-from-a-live-action-miles-morales-spider-man-kevin-feige-says) in the MCU.
