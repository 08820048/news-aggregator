LEGO is one of the most beloved toy brands. While these tiny plastic bricks have built their way into our hearts over the years, they've also made their way on to our screens. There have been a [ton of LEGO movies and TV shows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Lego_films_and_TV_series) released as far back as the early 2000s, but the biggest and most notable films all stem from 2014's The LEGO Movie.

Since The LEGO Movie had its debut in theaters, there have been two spin-offs and a direct sequel that have received a theatrical release. If you're wondering where exactly you can watch those movies in 2026, we've gathered all of the up-to-date streaming details right here.

Unfortunately, there is not singular location where you can stream all of the LEGO movies. The two spin-off films, The LEGO Batman Movie and The LEGO Ninjago Movie, are both currently available to stream with an [HBO Max subscription](https://www.ign.com/wikis/hbo-max/Plans_and_Pricing). However, if you want to watch The LEGO Movie or its sequel, you'll need to buy or rent them digitally from a VOD platform.

All four of the films are available to buy or rent digitally from [Prime Video](https://www.ign.com/wikis/prime-video) or [Apple TV](https://www.ign.com/wikis/apple-tv). You can rent each movie for $3.99, with the exception of The LEGO Ninjago Movie, which is $5.99 for some reason.

## Where to Buy the Movies in 4K

If you'd prefer to own the films rather than pay to rent or buy them digitally, you can currently find 4K Blu-ray editions of all four films on Amazon. There are also standard Blu-ray and DVD versions of each film available. Amazon is overall the [best place to buy 4K movies](https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-4k-uhd-blu-rays-online) in general, but you can also find all of the LEGO movies available on Gruv, which is the official storefront for physical movies from Warner Bros. and Universal.

## Upcoming LEGO Movies

Although we have don't any set release dates or titles just yet, it was revealed back in 2024 that there are [four live-action LEGO movies in the works](https://deadline.com/2024/10/lego-movies-patty-jenkins-jake-kasdan-joe-cornish-1236163597/) for Universal. Of the four films coming down the pipeline, the only one we really have any concrete details about is the untitled live-action Ninjago film. There isn't any sort of director attached, but we do know that Kevin and Dan Hageman are [reportedly writing the script](https://deadline.com/2024/10/lego-ninjago-movie-kevin-hageman-dan-hageman-in-works-universal-1236163709/). The two brothers are well-known for their work on the popular animated Ninjago TV series.

Outside of movies, there's also a [number of LEGO games in the works](https://www.ign.com/articles/all-lego-games-on-nintendo-switch-in-order#upcoming-games). The biggest upcoming game is [LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight](https://www.ign.com/games/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight), which is set to release on May 29 this year.
