[Harry Potter](https://www.ign.com/games/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-part-2) movie star Daniel Radcliffe has revealed he was once pitched a bizarre [Wizard of Oz](https://www.ign.com/movies/the-wizard-of-oz-1939) adaptation that also featured his fellow Hogwarts co-stars Emma Watson and Rupert Grint.

Describing it as "one of the worst ideas I've ever heard," the plan had apparently been for the Harry Potter trio to reunite in a fresh version of the classic story, for which Emma Watson would have played Kansas girl Dorothy.

Speaking via the [Hot Ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyw8CUE3LX4&t=3s) show, Radcliffe said the offer came in while the trio were still making the Harry Potter movies, when he was aged either 14 or 15. Even then, though, Radcliffe said he was instantly aware that this was "a bad idea."

"One of the worst ideas I've ever heard, during Potter, somebody came to us and I think asked... like they wanted to cast all three of us, me, Emma and Rupert, in a remake of Wizard of Oz," Radcliffe revealed. "Emma was Dorothy, I can't remember what Rupert was, and I just remember that I was going to be the lion, but also he knew karate?

"I was like a karate kicking cowardly lion," he continued. "And I remember I was like 14 or 15, and I was like, 'I don't know a lot about the world, but this is a bad idea, this should not be made."

For context, the timeline here would place Radcliffe and his co-stars as filming the fourth Harry Potter book, Goblet of Fire. So, had the Wizard of Oz remake progressed, the trio would still have been fairly young — though not too dissimilar to the age of 16-year-old Judy Garland in the story's classic 1939 adaptation.

Numerous Wizard of Oz adaptations have surfaced over the years, including various spin-offs, prequels and sequels. These include the 2013 Sam Raimi-directed Oz the Great and Powerful, which starred James Franco, Michelle Williams and Mila Kunis, and of course the two-part Wicked, starring Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande.

Earlier this week, Radcliffe discussed HBO's upcoming new adaptation of Harry Potter, and [issued a plea for the series' new young cast to be allowed to get on with their work](https://www.ign.com/articles/id-like-to-not-be-weird-spectral-phantoms-in-these-childrens-lives-daniel-radcliffe-says-dont-ask-the-new-harry-potter-tv-show-kids-about-him) without the original movies' cast becoming "spectral phantoms" in their lives. Maybe hold off from offering them a new Wizard of Oz adaptation, too?
