Arthur Morgan actor Roger Clark has revealed a Cameo apology request from a man who deleted his fiancé's Red Dead Redemption 2 save file.

Clark said that while he really enjoys sending messages to fans on Cameo, he sometimes encounters particularly special ones. Posting a screenshot of one such recent request to X / Twitter, Clark wrote: "I really am blown away by the support you guys show me on Cameo. Thank you for liking my shoutouts. I enjoy them all, but it's ones like these below that I live for. Let us all send this poor girl positive vibes. At least her man knows what he did."

For the 'occasion,' the Cameo requester wrote: "apology for deleting Red Dead saved game." In the instructions for Roger Clark, they added: "I just deleted my fiancé's saved game in Red Dead Redemption 2 by accident. She was having so much fun and made every ethical decision, had about \[two-thirds\] completed. Can you say some words of support for this devastating loss and let her know I am sorry?"

Understandably, Clark didn't show us his Cameo video response itself, although I'll admit that I wish he had!

The replies to Clark's tweet are a mix of disbelief and empathy. Some are wondering how the save file was deleted in the first place. Others are saying a Cameo from Arthur Morgan himself will surely ease the pain. "I think if someone deleted my 100% save file with everything unlocked and every piece of clothing bought, camp completed, map and journal drawings all there, dreamcatchers murals bones exotics and cards, a shout out from Roger Clark might heal the pain," said one fan.

Be sure to check out [IGN's big interview with Roger Clark on Arthur Morgan and Red Dead Redemption 2](https://www.ign.com/articles/before-rockstar-i-was-just-a-jobbing-actor-off-broadway-arthur-morgan-actor-roger-clark-on-the-red-dead-redemption-2-effect) to find out just how life-changing the iconic role was.

Meanwhile, Red Dead Redemption 2 fans recently made progress towards solving the game's newly-discovered spiderweb mystery, and now believe they've reached its final clue following a [major new discovery within Rockstar's epic cowboy sequel, dubbed the biggest uncovering of hidden content in years](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-discovery-in-red-dead-redemption-2-in-years-rockstar-fans-uncover-spiderweb-mystery-unnoticed-since-release-and-now-the-hunt-is-on-for-answers).

An intricately-placed breadcrumb trail of spiderwebs was found and plotted, leading to a further set of marked telegraph poles. These then pointed to a collection of guitars within the game's Fort Wallace location, where the trail temporarily went cold. Now, however, fans have pushed forwards — to what seems like a final clue beyond the edge of Red Dead Redemption 2's map.
