Upper Deck launched Neopets Battledome in 2024, a trading card game geared towards seasoned Neopets fans and newcomers alike. Its fast-paced, dice-based battles make Battledome unique from any other TCG on the market, and it just got a whole lot bigger thanks to the release of its latest expansion - **The Void Within**.

The Void Within brings with it a significant first for the still-young TCG, and something we’ve not seen from Neopets for over a decade - a brand-new plot. A mysterious void has opened up in Neopia, posing the biggest threat yet to the world Neopets call home, and it’s up to Battledome TCG players to fight back against the dark forces spilling out of it.

## The Neopets Battledome TCG’s Latest Expansion Includes 232 Original Cards To Collect

Neopets Battledome’s The Void Within expansion **adds a whopping 232 new cards to the TCG**. Among those new additions are the highly collectible Void Rarity cards. Both heroes and villains from the set are featured on the unique new cards, which have a black textured foil finish to truly set them apart from the TCG’s other card types.
