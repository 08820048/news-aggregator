Paramount+ subscribers have a lot to look forward this month, with a little bit of something for everyone. There are a ton of movies coming to the service starting on March 1, including the Angelina Jolie Tomb Raider movies, Spy Kids (1, 2, and 3-D), and almost [all of the Friday the 13th movies](https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-stream-friday-the-13th-movies) that were previously not available to stream. The first of the month is also the series premiere of Marshalls, a Yellowstone spin-off following Kayce Dutton roughly one year after the events of the Yellowstone finale.

March is also a big month for Paramount+ Originals as both School Spirits and [Star Trek: Starfleet Academy](https://www.ign.com/tv/star-trek-starfleet-academy) will be wrapping up with season finales. There's also the premiere yet another highly-anticipated Taylor Sheridan series called The Madison, which stars Michelle Pfeifer and Kurt Russel. It takes place in Montanna of course.

## Paramount+ Plans and Prices

[![Paramount+ US Membership](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/08/61ip-bx-rtl-1744113461830.png?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/QK8XEn?object_uuid=c3af55cf-753b-4d83-a8dd-cc8ccfbf3671&t=article "Paramount+ US Membership")

### Paramount+ US Membership

See all pricing options.

Paramount+ is currently available as a [monthly or annual subscription](https://www.ign.com/wikis/paramount-plus/Plans_and_Pricing), with the latter saving you a bit if you lock-in for a year at a time. There's also a discount available for students, which is the overall most reliable [Paramount+ deal](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-paramount-plus-deals) out there.

Since Paramount+ doesn't have a [free trial](https://www.ign.com/wikis/paramount-plus/Free_Trial) anymore, the only way to get access to a Paramount+ Essentials subscription without paying anything is via Walmart+, which [actually does offer a free trial](https://www.ign.com/wikis/walmart-plus/Free_Trial) for new subscribers.
