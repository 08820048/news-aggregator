Riot Games has announced it is reducing the size of its 2XKO development team, resulting in layoffs impacting approximately 80 workers.

In a [blog post](https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/an-update-on-2xko) written by 2XKO executive producer Tom Cannon, the downsizing came as a result of the game not reaching "the level needed to support a team of this size in the long term."

A spokesperson for Riot told [Game Developer](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/riot-games-lays-off-roughly-80-employees-from-2xko-team) that almost half the game's global development team have been affected by this decision.

"As we expanded from PC to console, we saw consistent trends in how players were engaging with 2XKO," wrote Cannon. "The game has resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn't reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term."

Cannon continued: "Ultimately, this decision reflects a shift in how we operate. This isn't a judgment on individual \[employees\] or a signal that the journey is over. We're reshaping the team to give 2XKO a more sustainable path forward."

Riot will help affected workers "explore opportunities" within the developer where possible, and provide a minimum of six months of notice and severance pay.

The free-to-play fighting title launched in early access for PC in October 2025, with a console release on January 20, 2026.

2XKO has been in development since 2019, [having initially been announced with the codename Project L](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/riot-expands-beyond-league-of-legends-with-rivals-to-overwatch-hearthstone-and-street-fighter).
