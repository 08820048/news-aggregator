The [best-selling isekai series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_light_novels) of all time, _That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime_, is ready to take over the spring anime season. The adventures of Rimuru and the other inhabitants of the Tempest Kingdom continue with a fourth season, [premiering on April 3 on Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/announcements/2026/2/25/that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime-season-4-stream-april-3-crunchyroll).

Strangely, the streaming giant did not use a new trailer to share the news, but merely re-uploaded [the same one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXKlTwGMUQQ) from two years ago that revealed season four and the second movie in the franchise were in production. Still, that did not spoil fans' excitement much. Back in December 2025, it was already revealed that the anime would come back this April, and that [it would be split into four cours](https://www.polygon.com/that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime-season-4-release-date-update/). Crunchyroll also announced that the movie [_That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime the Movie: Tears of the Azure Sea_](https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/announcements/2026/2/25/that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime-tears-of-the-azure-sea-movie-global-release-dates) will start airing internationally on April 26, and it's coming to North America on May 1.

_Reincarnated as a Slime_, also known as _TenSura_, has conquered the hearts of millions of fans worldwide thanks to its unconventional approach to the isekai genre. While some common elements are still present, such as an overpowered protagonist and the gamification of the world, this series focuses on politics and worldbuilding, keeping a lighter tone and mostly avoiding fan service and other controversial elements. (But you'll still get the odd beach episode or visit to the _onsen._) The protagonist is Rimuru Tempest, a former office worker from Japan who, after being stabbed in the street, awakens in a fantasy world as a slime, quickly rising from the weakest monster to the ruler of a powerful kingdom where all races can live in harmony.

Rimuru's power doesn't mean that he doesn't have enemies. His vision for the prosperity of the Tempest Kingdom and the surrounding nations will clash with the hidden powers of the world in this new season. Between four cours and a new movie, 2026 will truly be the Year of the Slime.
