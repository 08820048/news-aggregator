The [Secretlab Presidents Sale](https://zdcs.link/QqJ72D?object_uuid=ba24a8d5-2b80-4ea6-b5a4-ff6451792eaf&t=article) has officially commenced and with it are a couple of different promotions that are running concurrently (some are stackable). For starters, you can save up to $139 off across Secretlab's lineup of Titan Evo gaming chairs and Magnus gaming desks, including themed editions from One Piece, Jujutsu Kaisen, Star Wars, Demon Slayer, and more. Secretlab's highest-end gaming chair, the Titan Evo Nanogen, has also ben discounted.

In addition to these instant discounts, you can get extra tiered savings by hitting a certain order amount for each category. These should be stackable with the instant discounts, although some themes are excluded.

Finally, Secretlab's Genshin Impact themed gaming chairs gets some love of its own. The Ninguang and and Xiao inspired gaming chairs are on sale as well, to coincide with the Lantern Rite event that's going on right now in-game.

## Save $50 off Secretlab Titan Evo gaming chairs

The Titan Evo is Secretlab's most iconic and best selling chair. Over 70 different styles are currently on sale, with prices ranging from $529 to $634 after a $50 off instant discount across the entire lineup. It's available in small, medium, and large sizes, which is great for smaller people because most gaming chairs sold here in the United States are huge. Discounted upholstery optioins include Neo Hybrid leatherette and SoftWeave Plus fabric.

Signature features include a solid steel frame with aluminum wheelbase, firm and supportive cold-cure foam upholstery, adjustable four-way lumbar system, full length backrest with 165 degrees of recline, full metal 4D armrests with magnetically attached PU cushions, and a memory foam headrest pillow.

### Secretlab Titan Evo Genshin Edition (Xiao)

Genshin Impact's annual [Lantern Rite in-game event](https://www.hoyoverse.com/en-us/news/162178) is going on right now, coinciding with the actual Chinese New Year, which lands on February 17. In celebration of the event, Secretlab has discounted two Genshin themed chairs inspired by Liyue characters: Xiao, an anemo adeptus, and Ningguang, the geo-wielding Tianquan of the Liyue Qixing (she's basically a royal). This is the first time a Genshin chair has gone on sale, so if you're a Hoyoverse superfan, don't miss it.

## Secretlab's flagship Titan Evo Nanogen is also on sale

New Release

### Secretlab Titan Evo Nanogen Edition

The [Titan Evo Nanogen Edition](https://zdcs.link/zjGqGP?object_uuid=ba24a8d5-2b80-4ea6-b5a4-ff6451792eaf&t=article) is Secretlab's highest end chair and is rarely discounted. It normally sells for $799 at Secretlab direct, but both the white and black colors have been discounted by $50 during the Presidents Day Sale. If your budget can accomodate it, this is [the best gaming chair](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-gaming-chairs). In our recent [Titan Evo Nanogen Edition review](https://www.ign.com/articles/secretlab-titan-evo-nanogen-edition-review), Chris Coke wrote that "the Secretlab Titan Evo Nanogen Edition deserves every bit of the overwhelming praise I’ve given... The Titan Evo Nanogen Edition is class-leading, and is hands-down the most comfortable gaming chair I’ve ever used."

## Sadly, Titan Evo Pokemon Edition preorders aren't discounted

[![Titan Evo Pokemon Eevee Edition](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/secretlabeevee-1769122757965.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/z7RWMP?object_uuid=ba24a8d5-2b80-4ea6-b5a4-ff6451792eaf&t=article "Titan Evo Pokemon Eevee Edition")

### Titan Evo Pokemon Eevee Edition

[![Titan Evo Pokemon Gengar Edition](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/secretlabgengar-1769122440632.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/922j1Y?object_uuid=ba24a8d5-2b80-4ea6-b5a4-ff6451792eaf&t=article "Titan Evo Pokemon Gengar Edition")

### Titan Evo Pokemon Gengar Edition

[![Titan Evo Pokemon Pikachu Edition](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/secretlabpikachu-1769122643860.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/z64wDl?object_uuid=ba24a8d5-2b80-4ea6-b5a4-ff6451792eaf&t=article "Titan Evo Pokemon Pikachu Edition")

### Titan Evo Pokemon Pikachu Edition

Secretlab's recently announced [lineup of Pokémon gaming chairs](https://www.ign.com/articles/now-you-can-show-off-your-favorite-pokmon-on-a-secretlab-titan-evo-gaming-chair) is, not surprisingly, still listed at full price. Even so, these chairs are so cool that they're worth a mention. These chairs showcase one of three iconic Pokémon - Gengar, Pikachu, and Eevee - with ostentatious use of color, patterns, and figures. My personal favorite is the Eevee edition, with its detailed embossing of Eevee's myriad evolutions; it also seems to be the top seller, since it's already on its third wave of preorders.

Unusual for a collab, Secretlab opted to go with its Softweave Plus fabric instead of leatherette, and I for one am happy with that decision. Fabric ages more gracefully, feels softer, and doesn't stick to your sweaty skin on hot days.

## Save $30 off the Titan Evo recliner add-on (it's worth it)

[![Secretlab Titan Recliner Add-On](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/12/secretlabrecliner-1731444678694.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/Qxx5XP?object_uuid=ba24a8d5-2b80-4ea6-b5a4-ff6451792eaf&t=article "Secretlab Titan Recliner Add-On")

### Secretlab Titan Recliner Add-On

Also on sale for the first time, Secretlab's [new recliner add-on](https://zdcs.link/QGVkVV?object_uuid=ba24a8d5-2b80-4ea6-b5a4-ff6451792eaf&t=article) is $30 off for Christmas. This is a nice upgrade for anyone who already owns the Titan Evo chair. In our [recliner add-on review](https://www.ign.com/articles/secretlab-ergonomic-recliner-add-on-review), Chris Coke wrote that "while both comfort and value are subjective things, the recliner is able to take the Titan Evo and transform it from one of the best racing style gaming chairs to standing head and shoulders above the competition at its price point."

## Secretlab Magnus deals are also on sale, including Genshin

[![Secretlab Magnus](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/12/secretlabmagnusdesk-1731444077208.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/QGrJGV?object_uuid=ba24a8d5-2b80-4ea6-b5a4-ff6451792eaf&t=article "Secretlab Magnus")

The Magnus is a traditional fixed-frame gaming desk while the Magnus Pro ups the ante with practical electric sit-stand functionality.

## Secretlab has the best "racing-style" gaming chairs

It's no secret that we love our Secretlab gaming chairs. Three of the eight chairs in our [best gaming chair](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-gaming-chairs) roundup are Secretlab models. Of all the gaming chairs we covered in our "[Budget to Best](https://www.ign.com/videos/the-best-gaming-chairs-early-2023-budget-to-best)" roundup video earlier this year, my colleague Akeem Lawanson considered the Secretlab Titan Evo to be the most comfortable. No good chair comes cheap and Secretlab chairs definitely cost a premium, but we think the craftsmanship, materials, and customizability are worth it.
