Considering what it offers, Disney+ is one of the best streaming services on the block. From classic Disney animated films to the latest from the MCU (currently [Wonder Man](https://www.ign.com/tv/wonder-man)), [Star Wars](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-movies), and so much more, Disney+ puts an incredible range of high-quality viewing options at your fingertips. There's tons to watch, but after [another round of price hikes](https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/disney-plus-hulu-price-increases-october-2025-1236527241/), you might want to revisit your streaming subscriptions. We're here to help.

At the moment, one of the best Disney Plus bundle deals available is the massive Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max streaming bundle. This starts at [**$19.99/month**](https://zdcs.link/QpXAKZ?object_uuid=45310abb-e2ad-4541-9a0a-5da4cfe0d7f6&t=article) to get you all three streaming services with ads. Bundles are definitely worth considering, especially following the news of [Hulu eventually fully integrating into the Disney+ app.](https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/hulu-app-phased-out-disney-plus-fully-integrating-1236480450/)

3-Day Free Trial

### Hulu + Live TV (Free Trial)

Includes Disney+ (With Ads) and ESPN Unlimited

Starting from the top, if you haven't gotten a Disney+ subscription yet, you might be interested in any free trials. While Disney+ [doesn't offer it's own free trial directly](https://www.ign.com/wikis/disney-plus/Free_Trial), it is technically included in a [Hulu + Live TV subscription](https://www.ign.com/articles/hulu-plus-live-tv-prices-and-plans) (alongside Hulu and ESPN Unlimited), which does happen to offer a [three-day free trial](https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-get-hulu-plus-live-tv-free-trial). Just remember that plan will auto-renew at the full live TV cost of $89.99 after the trial period.

### Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max

$19.99/month with ads, $32.99/month ad-free

Want a way to save on your Disney+ membership sooner rather than later? [Bundles](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-streaming-bundle-packages) are a great, affordable way to go. Our top recommendation is the [Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max streaming bundle](https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-get-disney-hulu-max-bundle) can be purchased through any of the three streaming services and starts at **$19.99/month for the ad-supported tier** or **$32.99/month for ad-free access** across the three platforms. If you currently own all three and want to cut down on costs, this is a great way to bundle them together and save big on what you'd pay for them separately per month – 42% on the ad-supported plan and 43% on the ad-free plan.

### Every Other Disney+ Bundle Option

Beyond HBO Max, you can also choose to bundle Disney+ with just Hulu or the [all-new ESPN Unlimited service](https://www.ign.com/articles/espn-unlimited-subscription-plans-and-prices). Here's the breakdown of all your bundle options:

-   [**Disney+, Hulu Bundle**](https://zdcs.link/z7EjpP?object_uuid=45310abb-e2ad-4541-9a0a-5da4cfe0d7f6&t=article) is **$12.99/month** and comes with subscriptions to Disney+ and Hulu. This plan lets you stream on multiple devices at once and comes with ad-supported versions of both services.

## What About Standalone Disney+ Subscriptions?

[![Sign Up for Disney+](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2020/10/20/disney-plus-1603224040037.png?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/z3RljM?object_uuid=45310abb-e2ad-4541-9a0a-5da4cfe0d7f6&t=article "Sign Up for Disney+")

### Sign Up for Disney+

Disney+ is available in a couple of different tiers. You can get the least expensive option (simply called Disney+) for **$11.99/month**, which gives you access to everything except the ability to download select shows to watch on the go. This tier is ad supported. If you want to get rid of ads and be able to download certain shows, you can spring for the **$18.99/month** or **$189.99/year** Disney+ Premium package.

### What Is the Paid Sharing Plan on Disney Plus?

In an effort to crack down on password sharing, [Disney has added a paid sharing plan for individuals outside of your household](https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-plus-password-sharing-crackdown-launches-with-a-paid-sharing-program). Basically, anyone using your account that's not within your household will have to be added as an "Extra Member" to your account. This costs an additional **$6.99/month for the ad-supported subscription** and **$9.99/month for the Premium ad-free plan**, and only one Extra Member slot is available per account. You can learn more from [Disney's paid sharing explainer here](https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/paid-sharing-disney-explainer/).

## Disney+ Gift Cards

If you want to help someone out and give them a gift that will keep on giving, [gifting a one-year Disney+ card](https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-gift-a-disney-streaming-subscription-to-someone) is a great option. It provides all the great things Disney+ offers and it costs a fraction of what it would take to buy even a small sampling of those movies physically.

### Disney+

Give one of the best subscription services around as a gift. With Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and National Geographic access, it's a great place to watch.

## What Can You Watch on Disney+?

There is a bonkers array of shows and movies you can watch on Disney+. Highlights [coming to Disney+ in February](https://www.ign.com/articles/whats-new-on-disney-plus-february-2026) include the return of The Muppet Show, a new season of The Artful Dodger, and a 24/7 Hannah Montana stream. For new and potential subscribers, here's a deeper dive into what's available on the service:

### Disney

On the Disney front, you have awesome classic movies like The Sword In The Stone, Robin Hood, 101 Dalmations, Hercules, and Sleeping Beauty, modern classics like The Princess & The Frog, Tangled, and Frozen, and a wide range of animated shows, including Phineas & Ferb.

You also gain access to a ton of vintage content like Escape to Witch Mountain, The Apple Dumpling Gang, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes, The Love Bug, and a whole lot more. The Disney Junior section is home to absolutely top tier animated shows like Bluey (which, for my money, is worth the price of admission on its own).

There's way more on offer, too, including a ton of Muppet movies, new live-action films and adaptions (including the new [Snow White](https://www.ign.com/movies/snow-white-2025)), nature programs, documentaries, Pirates of the Caribbean, and musical programs featuring Taylor Swift (like her wildly popular [The Eras Tour](https://www.ign.com/movies/taylor-swift-the-eras-tour)), Elton John, Ed Sheeran, and more.

### Pixar

When it comes to computer generated films, Pixar stands alone. Kicking off the revolution with Toy Story, Pixar has consistently put out fantastic films, and they are all here. From the Toy Story series to Finding Nemo, Cars, and more recent hits like [Inside Out 2](https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-watch-inside-out-2), there is a ton to love.

Beyond even that, there are incredible shorts like Bao and Party Central, as well as a wide range of originals and series based on major films, such as Dory's Reef Cam, Forky Asks A Question, Cars On The Road, and more.

### Marvel

The MCU has become a true juggernaut, and there are many viewers who subscribe to Disney+ purely for access to nearly the entire MCU lineup of films and shows.

Whether you are a fan of the blockbuster action films, you are an appreciator of the classic 90s runs of "Saturday morning" cartoons like X-Men, or you are currently vibing to the funky theme of the 1981 Spider-Man series, there is a ton of Marvel to enjoy on Disney+. And with new movies and shows being added to the MCU all the time, including most recently [the series Wonder Man](https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-watch-thunderbolts-streaming), there is always more coming.

### Star Wars

A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, there was a film that changed everything. The original Star Wars is a seminal sci-fi fantasy work that inspired generations of creators, but there is still nothing quite like that far away galaxy. Disney+ grants access to [all things Star Wars](https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-movies-tv-shows-chronological-order), including the remastered versions of the original trilogy (hopefully some day they'll add the theatrical cuts, too), as well as the prequels and sequels.

You can also stay up-to-date on all the latest shows, including [The Mandalorian](https://www.ign.com/tv/star-wars-the-mandalorian) and the critically-lauded [Andor](https://www.ign.com/tv/star-wars-andor), which recently wrapped up its [second and final season](https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-watch-andor-season-2). There are also fantastic short series like Star Wars Visions, and longer-form series like [The Clone Wars](https://www.ign.com/tv/star-wars-the-clone-wars), [The Bad Batch](https://www.ign.com/tv/star-wars-the-bad-batch), [Young Jedi Adventures](https://www.ign.com/tv/star-wars-young-jedi-adventures), and a whole lot more.
