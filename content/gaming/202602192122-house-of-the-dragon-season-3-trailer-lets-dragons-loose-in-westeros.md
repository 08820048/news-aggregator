The fire-breathing dragons of the Game of Thrones universe are heading to the sea as war breaks out in the first teaser trailer for [House of the Dragon](https://www.ign.com/tv/game-of-thrones-house-of-the-dragon) Season 3.

Regardless of the tense conversations had in the Season 2 finale, Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma D’Arcy) and Queen Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke) are heading to war. Today’s trailer gives viewers just a glimpse of the battle ahead, showing fights filled with fire and blood as the factions in Dragonstone and the Red Keep fight for the Iron Throne.

House of the Dragon Season 3 picks up where the show left off in 2024, and that means all of the story’s major players are back, too. Highlights from the footage (above) show Jacaerys (Harry Collett) warning against his mother’s decision to trust Alicent, while faces like Daemon (Matt Smith) and Corlys (Steve Toussaint) head to the front lines.

Meanwhile, as an injured Aegon II (Tom Glynn-Carney) leaves the Red Keep, it seems his brother, Aemond (Ewan Mitchell), is starting to get quite comfy on the Iron Throne. As the trailer reaches its conclusion, audiences are warned that Rhaenyra’s true reign as Queen of Westeros is almost here.

HBO has yet to announce a release date for House of the Dragon Season 3. However, as revealed [with teaser art yesterday](https://www.ign.com/articles/house-of-the-dragon-season-3-sets-june-premiere-with-first-look-at-a-menacing-rhaenyra), we do at least know that the Game of Thrones spinoff show’s latest batch of episodes is set to premiere sometime in June. It means we have a few more months of waiting to do, and maybe even a few more trailers, before we see how its adaptation of the events of George R.R. Martin’s Fire & Blood will continue.

House of the Dragon originally launched in 2022 and has taken a two-year break between season premieres. Season 4 will [be its last](https://www.ign.com/articles/hbo-makes-it-official-house-of-the-dragon-ends-with-season-4), and as revealed in [a roadmap published by HBO](https://www.ign.com/articles/hbo-issues-marvel-style-roadmap-for-game-of-thrones-confirms-a-knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-season-2-and-house-of-the-dragon-season-4) last year, we can expect it to tie a bow on the story in 2028.
