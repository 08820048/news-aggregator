Not all pocket monsters live inside a Poké Ball

Pokémon was officially born three decades ago on Feb. 27, 1996 with the release of _Pokémon Red and Green_, but plenty of fans wouldn’t discover the franchise until its television debut a year later in Japan (and two years later in the United States). With the release of the Pokémon anime, we all fell in love with Pikachu and his adorable antics. The world would never be the same again.

Today, Pokémon is a sprawling multimedia empire that includes innumerable [video games](https://www.polygon.com/best-pokemon-spinoffs-ranch-duel-magikarp-jump/), animated titles, [trading card games](https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-tcg/), and highly coveted merchandise. But for many, the nostalgic pull of Pokémon is forever tied to [_Pokémon the Series_](https://www.polygon.com/anime/600076/pokemon-xy-kalos-quest-netflix-release/), which aired over 1,300 episodes between 1997 and 2023. There’s a timeless element to the television series that also feels like it belongs to a simpler era.

The first season of the _Pokémon_ anime, titled “Pokémon: Indigo League,” introduced Ash Ketchum (Satoshi in Japanese), a spirited kid from Pallet Town who receives Pikachu from the eccentric (and kind-hearted) Professor Oak. What starts as a humble attempt to compete in the Kanto League shapes up into an epic adventure with trusted friends who commit to Ash’s mantra of “gotta catch ‘em all.” These arcs aren’t rehashes of the games either, as we’re immersed in the nitty-gritties of bonding with these pocket monsters and [unleashing them during battles](https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-30th-anniversary-battle-for-mew/). No matter how long Ash spends in [a floating timeline](https://screenrant.com/pokemon-anime-timeskip-why-now-ash-ketchum-theory/), we’re inclined to hope that such a beautiful journey never ends.

The enduring popularity of _Pokémon the Series_ inspired countless clones, also-rans, and look-alikes. Some stick close to the premise of capturing and rearing pocket monsters, while others heavily incorporate the show’s trading card game elements to branch into distinct battle mechanics. With this spectrum in mind, here are 10 anime worth checking out if you adore Pokémon.

## 1 Digimon Adventure

    ![A small child clutches his cheek and a pink monster looks sad in Digimon Adventure](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-w1280-4.jpg?q=70&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=1)Image: Toei Animation

[The beloved Digimon franchise](https://www.polygon.com/609770/digimon-story-time-stranger-vs-pokemon/) didn’t begin with 1999’s [_Digimon Adventure_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B0CV8PWXSR?&linkCode=ll2&tag=polyus-20&linkId=77ecaf6a0ba4bb26814adc77e8171bf2&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl), but with WiZ and Bandai’s virtual pet, The Digital Monster. This toy wasn’t unlike a battle Tamagotchi, becoming popular enough to sell [24 million units](https://web.archive.org/web/20170513065731/http://www.animenewsservice.com/archives-nov30/) worldwide by 2005. The original _Digimon Adventure_ might’ve been created to bolster sales at the time, but it’s a breathtaking introduction to the franchise’s vibrant world. The anime opens with seven children from Odaiba (who later learn that they are “DigiDestined,” or the chosen ones) being transported into the Digital World, where digital monsters named Digimon can be evolved and deployed for combat. This is obviously similar to the concept of Pokémon trainers working in tandem to evolve creatures for tournaments, but the _Digimon Adventure_ saga switches things up in sequel entries like the six-part _Digimon Adventure tri_. While the 1999 series champions a simplistic good-versus-evil ethos, it’s fascinating to watch the DigiDestined fight alongside the likes of Gomamon or Agumon throughout the arcs.

## 2 Beyblade

    ![A blue haired girl with red jacket points at the camera in Beyblade season 1](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/c98b398c55d061a4d2faa7eeff10b38952ca5fd42234f1cf9932df056f71cc57-1.jpg?q=70&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=1)Image: Madhouse

Yet another Japanese toyline that became a multimedia franchise, [Beyblade](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B00FGKVUIK?&linkCode=ll2&tag=polyus-20&linkId=1e05b96df3fbf4cd1e5d523b46a7c9ce&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) feels close to Pokémon despite operating on a distinct combat mechanic. These spinning top toys are based on traditional Japanese tops named beigoma, which are launched on a flat surface with long cords (Beigoma Academy in _Beyblade Burst_ is a direct reference). Takao Aoki’s _Beyblade_ manga was adapted into a popular anime of the same name by Madhouse in 2001, introducing millions of kids to Tyson Granger (Takao Kinomiya in Japanese) and his exciting adventures. After Tyson defeats a local gang leader in a Beybattle, the involvement of Kai Hiwatari, the leader of the Blade Sharks, leads to a tense rivalry between the two. Once Tyson discovers his Bit-Beast, Dragoon, he sets his sights on winning the Japanese Regional Qualifying Tournament, befriending fellow blades like Ray Kon and Max Tate along the way. While _Beyblade_ isn’t perfect by any stretch of the imagination, its fantastical extremes are served with a side of endearing charm.

## 3 Yu-Gi-Oh!

    ![Yami Yugi stares ahead with a third eye etched on his forehead in Yu-Gi-Oh! Season 0](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/yami-yugi-from-yu-gi-oh.jpg?q=70&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=1)Image: Toei Animation

Kazuki Takahashi’s [_Yu-Gi-Oh!_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B00F3I55OU?&linkCode=ll2&tag=polyus-20&linkId=fbc7701e67791753749eb6d03d75141a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) manga begins with Yugi Mutou inheriting the ancient Egyptian Millennium Puzzle from his grandfather, which he is able to solve after dedicating eight years to the endeavor. This prompts Yugi to become host to a gambling alter-ego/spirit named Yami Yugi (who is the reincarnation of the Pharaoh, Atem), who steers the narrative towards the card game, Duel Monsters. Today, [_Yu-Gi-Oh!_ is a massive franchise](https://www.polygon.com/22949449/yu-gi-oh-master-duel-card-game/), but the 1988 Toei Animation series kick-started its well-earned popularity by embracing a darker undertone than subsequent titles like _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_. The artstyle is also significantly different from the trademark aesthetic of the series, with vivid, saturated characters contrasting against muted backdrops. This early adaptation, referred to as _Yu-Gi-Oh! Season 0,_ follows a villain-of-the-week format to keep things interesting enough, while indulging in slice-of-life elements through the bonds forged by our protagonist.

## 4 Dinosaur King

    ![A child happily hugs his pet dinosaur in Dinosaur King](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/maxresdefault-1-2.jpg?q=70&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=1)Image: Sunrise

In 2005, Sega released a card-based arcade game named [_Dinosaur King_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B0B8J2B29M?&linkCode=ll2&tag=polyus-20&linkId=a676a4df2de80082b9c743a4e7818b7b&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl), which shared gameplay mechanics with their mega-popular collectible card arcade title, _Mushiking: The King of Beetles_. A TCG followed soon after, along with the eponymous anime series produced by Sunrise. The _Dinosaur King_ anime riffs on the core premise of Pokémon in a fun way, but it is somewhat niche (and overlooked) compared to successful Pokémon clones like Digimon. In this story, Max Taylor, the son of a paleontologist, sets out on an adventure with his pals Rex and Zoe after witnessing a meteor fall from the sky. After finding elemental stones and a card with the depiction of a Triceratops, Max accidentally activates the dinosaur (named Chomp) by rubbing the card against the stones. This gives way to conflict with various villains, and the tale takes a predictable turn over the course of two seasons. A rather middling entry that is decently enjoyable if you like the idea of summoning dinosaurs for battle.

## 5 Bakugan Battle Brawlers

    ![Three children look amazed after walking out of a portal in Bakugan Battle Brawlers](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/84f5f0cc4562f885c61028c6769eb98862c22bddd4f8842d7b6440574b32dab2-_sx1080_fmjpg_-1.jpg?q=70&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=1)Image: TMS Entertainment

[_Bakugan Battle Brawlers_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B00C0YDM7M?&linkCode=ll2&tag=polyus-20&linkId=c1ecdb62e7464f2416e647fe836734f6&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) was a joint venture between Sega Toys and Spin Master, with the anime contextualizing the toys and merchandise released for international markets. _Bakugan’_s first season centers on Dan, who happens to catch a card that falls out of the sky and invents a ranked competitive game called Battle Brawlers with his friends. The kids are gradually made aware of the alternate world of Vestroia, which is being attacked by Doom Beings like Naga (a rogue Bakugan) and Marduk (a human brawler). As with most stories with a fantastical premise, _Bakugan Battle Brawlers_ stretches the limits of suspending disbelief and even introduces plotpoints devoid of real-world logic (for instance, Dan and fellow Brawler Shun Kazami claim to have invented the rules for Bakugan, but seem perpetually unaware of basic concepts, and even misidentify some of the monsters they summon). The show’s exaggerated nature might have something to do with the urge to cash in on the Pokémon craze without having a story to back it up. That said, the second season, _New Vestroia_, is much more streamlined and intricate.

## 6 Shadow Star

    ![A young girl walks home while carrying a starfish spirit on her back in Shadow Star](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/14115606dc94360ffe8ecacff98b527f-1.jpg?q=70&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=1)Image: Planet

Perhaps the most underrated Pokémon look-alike, _Shadow Star_ elevates its monster-rearing roots with great thematic complexity. The 13-episode anime based on Mohiro Kitoh’s manga aired in 2003, featuring Shiina Tamao, who bonds with a starfish-shaped shadow dragon named Hoshimaru. Their interactions take on a dreamy, laidback quality at first, but [_Shadow Star_ takes a pretty dark turn](https://www.cbr.com/shadowstar-narutaru-manga-dark-pokemon-deconstruction/) when Shiina realizes that other star dragons aren’t as well-intentioned as Hoshimaru. This sudden burst of violence goes hand in hand with the trauma experienced by impressionable kids, who icy-hearted adults fail to protect. There’s a direct link between the emotional states of humans and their shadow dragons, lending _Shadow Star_ a psychologically dense bent. This beautiful, haunting title is on the obscure side of things, as its licensed DVD boxset (English dub) has been out-of-print since 2009.

## 7 Battle Doll: Angelic Layer

    ![A young girl with pink hair dons battle armor and takes a defensive stance in Battle Doll: Angelic Layer](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/b4867e467065ad69f2c535269c92cc6ade518b820f2153e2942e042887da8751-1.jpg?q=70&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=1)Image: Bones

Clamp’s _Angelic Layer_ manga didn’t come with any toy or merch tie-ins, but it helms a unique genre-blending premise. After moving to Tokyo, seventh-grader Misaki Suzuhara gets acquainted with a competitive game called Angelic Layer, in which players wield custom-designed dolls known as Angels to battle against opponents. This highly televised sports sensation piques Misaki’s interest, after which she creates an Angel called Hikaru and gradually becomes well-versed in the rules of the game. The concept of a predominantly female cast engaging in a battle [shonen](https://www.polygon.com/anime-genres-meaning-list-explained-shonen-shojo-seinin-isekai/)\-coded sports tournament was rare in 1999, even when the Bones-produced anime, _Battle Doll: Angelic Laye_r, aired in 2001. The near-future backdrop aesthetics are also surprisingly grounded, which works in favor of an outlandish battle-royale like Angelic Layer and its incorporation of theatrical martial arts.

## 8 Yo-kai Watch

    ![A redheaded kid holds up an elemental stone and laughs in Yo-Kai Watch](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/yokai-watch-042314.jpg?q=70&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=1)Image: OLM

[_Yo-kai Watch_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B07JJ98KWZ?&linkCode=ll2&tag=polyus-20&linkId=a5cb5d9d0adf6e8203147d7bd2821eda&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) started as [a console RPG series](https://www.polygon.com/2015/11/4/9671722/yo-kai-watch-review-nintendo-3ds/) in 2013, whose popularity launched an associated toy line by Bandai (Japan) and Hasbro (Americas and Europe). The _Yo-kai Watch_ anime, which aired in 2014, capitalized on the solid narrative foundation of children being able to befriend and summon yo-kai, or spirits. If you’ve played any of the _Yo-kai Watch_ games, the spectacular worldbuilding and pleasantly bizarre monster design stand out right off the bat. The interactivity between humans and yo-kai is the most fun aspect of these game narratives — an aspect that is lost in the anime. Nonetheless, 2014’s _Yo-kai Watch_ is thoroughly charming due to its comedic tone, where 11-year-old overachiever Nate indulges in all kinds of wacky shenanigans involving troublemaking yo-kai. This one is geared towards children, but that shouldn’t stop anyone from immersing themselves in such a whimsical world.

## 9 Zatch Bell!

    ![A group of kids play around while a two-legged created looks on in Zatch Bell!](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/aaaabzhudtkgqo2tp9cgwurunwdmqkbb_sowhyefakmk2_nueqxod4a6ysmxfji_n6pdjligrtg4t1dsypllak5l9vodxg_j3extowy5.jpg?q=70&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=1)Image: Toei Animation

Toei Animation adapted Makoto Raiku’s award-winning [_Zatch Bell!_](https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GRE5104P6/zatch-bell?srsltid=AfmBOooQ6Qymg0AEx7PQYxCSr7Qmm2g6OydWv3590oVf5s1tSi0oLAOg) manga in 2003, but its merits remain overlooked to this day. The anime’s interpretation of the manga is extremely exaggerated, and it is enthusiastic enough to keep you thoroughly hooked with its stylistic exuberance. The themes of overcoming adversity and forging identity feel par for the course here, but _Zatch Bell!_ throws in a good measure of graphic violence to reinvigorate its stale inspirations. In the anime, the titular Zatch is found unconscious inside a forest by Professor Takamine, who sends Zatch to live with his son Kiyo in the city of Mochinoki. Zatch and Kiyo team up to participate in an elimination tournament held for the Mamodo, a species of mystical creatures who live in a parallel world. The duo forges alliances with several Mamodo, like Kanchomé, introducing good old power scaling employed remarkably well in this context.

## 10 Monster Rancher

    ![The primary cast of the Monster Rancher anime pose happily in a meadow](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/9a173210da94fcbe07937b1b034310525f586ddb4c099c60e4483fa1db91dbd3-_sx1080_fmjpg_-1.jpg?q=70&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=1)Image: TMS Entertainment

Tecmo’s (now Koei Tecmo) [_Monster Rancher_ games](https://www.polygon.com/22642718/monster-rancher-1-2-dx-switch-pc-ios/) are heavily comparable to Pokémon, as they function on the same principle of rearing virtual pets to fight in tournaments. The aim is to keep these monsters healthy while influencing their morale, which directly impacts their playstyle and performance during battle. The [_Monster Rancher_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B0DNDM6VKN?&linkCode=ll2&tag=polyus-20&linkId=42a9247a80086f44503296a6cddaad5e&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) games, and by extension, the anime, carry a kernel of nostalgia. It’s the kind of franchise you thoroughly enjoy as a kid but inevitably outgrow as you grow up. Even so, the _Monster Rancher_ anime makes effective use of the [isekai](https://www.polygon.com/anime-genres-meaning-list-explained-shonen-shojo-seinin-isekai/) trope, where monster-enthusiast Genki Sakura is transported to a monster world after inserting a video game disk into his console. After meeting Holly and her monster pal Suezo, Genki ends up summoning the duck-like monster, Mocchi. The subsequent whirlwind of monster attacks, power-ups, and new friendships makes _Monster Rancher_ thoroughly entertaining.
