[Resident Evil Requiem](https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem) has landed on Steam, and is now the series' biggest launch to date on Valve's PC platform.

At the time of writing, 230,210 people are playing Capcom's latest chapter of survival horror on Steam — though shortly after launch, a [peak](https://steamdb.info/app/3764200/charts/#48h) of 267,509 users were in-game concurrently.

That figure marks Resident Evil's best ever numbers on Steam, up from the 168,191 peak for Resident Evil 4 Remake in March 2023, and the 106,631 who turned up for Resident Evil 7 back in 2021. It also paints a pretty positive picture for the game's sales performance overall.

Of course, these numbers reflect just a fraction of the overall number of players now getting started in and around Raccoon City. Requiem is also available on PC via Epic Games Store, and of course has launched on consoles for Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, where many more will be playing.
