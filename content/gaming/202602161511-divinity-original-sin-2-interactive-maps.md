When you first look at a [_Divinity: Original Sin 2_](http://www.polygon.com/game/divinity-original-sin-2/38639/) map, you might think it's a bit small. Surely, there can't be _that_ much to deal with in such a tiny area, right? Wrong. _Original Sin 2_ stuffs every map, even the prologue map, with quests, secrets, lore, optional fights, allies, and essential equipment, and as you progress further in the game, things get even more open-ended. You could go off and explore the woods around Reaper's Coast, for example, or you could take the safe route and clear every quest in the port first to make sure you've leveled up enough.

Our set of **_Divinity: Original Sin 2_ maps** below lays out several areas across Larian's vast RPG, from boss battles and enemy encounters to side quests, missable gear, and more.

## The Hold interactive map

Nothing says you're on your own like taking a first look at The Hold map. It might be the game's tutorial area, but it's still surprisingly easy to get lost on its several levels or miss important interactions with allies and other characters. Or wind up in a fight you're not ready for.

There's a lot to see in the prologue, and our **interactive map of The Hold** is here to make sure you can do it all. It shows you main quest and side quest locations, alongside spots where enemy encounters take place, friendly NPC locations, loot, lore, and a whole lot more.

## Fort Joy interactive map

If you thought The Hold was dense with things to do, Fort Joy is on a whole other level. The Magisters' prison island is absolutely _crammed_ with quests, secrets, and optional bosses, most of which all have multiple ways you can approach them. There's also nothing to stop you from tackling challenges at a much higher level than you should be, so make sure you wander responsibly (and save often).

The **Fort Joy interactive map** below points out all the important things for you, so you can plan a safer, more informed escape. We've got enemies and quests, treasure and lore, vendors, non-dangerous NPCs, and bosses.

## The Lady Vengeance interactive map

Your first experience on a ship might not have ended so well, but The Lady Vengeance in _Divinity: Original Sin 2_ promises to be a different story. Hopefully. With Fort Joy in the past, this ship is now your base of sorts, with a handful of NPCs and some hidden treasure, if you know where to look. It's also where you can respec, if you decide it's time for a change.

Our **Lady Vengeance interactive map** shows you where all the important people and places are onboard. Just make sure to check back after you complete major quests, as folks may have more things to share, and you may even end up with a prisoner on board depending on how you handle certain quests.

## Reaper's Coast interactive map

You've reached land and arrived at Reaper's Coast. Buckle up, 'cause this next part of your journey is one heck of a ride. The coast is even more densely packed with quests and secrets than Fort Joy was — and the same goes for dangers, too. Safely exploring the region means taking each chunk of the map one step at a time, first the village and its many quests to help you gain XP before you branch out further, toward the cemetery and west toward the coast. The further you get from the village, the more dangerous your journey becomes. Leave the far northern forest and island, and the barren land to the southeast, until later.

This **Reaper's Coast map** helps you keep everything in order, with all the treasure and lore you can find in the region, plus quest locations, where to find important characters, and much more.

## Nameless Isle interactive map

The Nameless Isle in _Divinity Original Sin 2_ might be smaller than everywhere else you've explored before, but it's the most dangerous location yet. Magisters and Black Ring forces collide, frequently, and they don't mind getting you caught up in their war (but they do mind when you choose sides). There are fewer quests to tackle here, but you'll want to track them all done. Some of them, like The Academy, have dramatic consequences for the rest of your adventure.

Our **Nameless Isle interactive map** shows you where to find all those quests, along with where to expect trouble so you can prepare before the fighting breaks out.

* * *

## Arx interactive map

It's the end of the line when you reach Arx. The main quest is drawing to a close, and the map is smaller than most, like the Nameless Isle before it. But there's still a lot to take care of outside the story quest before the credits roll. It's worth tracking down every side quest and bit of loot you can, so you're fully prepared before challenging _Original Sin 2_'s most formidable foes.

This **Arx interactive map** shows you where to find everything there is to see in the city, including side quests to help wrap up any lingering threads, spots where you can expect hostilities to ensue, and the last bits and pieces of lore to scoop up.
