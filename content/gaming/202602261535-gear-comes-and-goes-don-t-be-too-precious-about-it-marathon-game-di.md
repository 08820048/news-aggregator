The game director of extraction shooter [Marathon](https://www.ign.com/games/marathon) has offered a number of top tips for players jumping into the server slam event this weekend.

Bungie’s Joe Ziegler took to [social media](https://x.com/Ziegler_Dev/status/2026971692896338372) to offer last-minute tips. I’m hoping to carve out some time this weekend to give Marathon a shot myself, so I found these tips interesting. Hopefully they will also prove useful!

-   gear comes and goes, don’t be too precious about it, but learn to use what you got and it will serve you.
-   remember to bring enough ammo and consumables to survive a couple fights, if you don’t have much then use a sponsored kit or play as rook and focus your runs on getting gear and creds or stocking up on resources.
-   if you’re learning don’t rush your contract objectives, playing slow can help you avoid getting overwhelmed.
-   keep your ears open. You will often hear threats before you see them.
-   try to take the fights you think you can win, you don’t need to fight everything. Greed and ambition can lead to a quick downfall.
-   don’t sleep on the battery weapons, in the right hands they are strong, but remember if you reload with them before they’re empty, you lose the battery.
-   a friend who plays Triage is a keeper. Be kind to them.
-   if you want to win a fight, use what your opponent wants against them. Patience and cunning are powerful allies.
-   stray rooks are unpredictable and can either be a blessing or a curse depending on how you treat them.
-   don’t tilt, cooler heads make smarter decisions.
-   if all else fails beg for mercy in prox chat and hope someone listens :)

It all sounds pretty intense, but that’s what you’d expect from an extraction shooter. I expect I’ll be leaning on that last tip over the weekend.

The Marathon server slam runs from today, February 26, to March 2. We’ve got a [quick guide to the exact launch times across the globe](https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-server-slam-release-times-and-details-confirmed), as well as the associated rewards, so you know when you can get that download going and jump in. Marathon's full launch is scheduled for March 5 across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S. PlayStation Plus subscribers can nab bonus weapon charms themed around Ghost of Yōtei, Death Stranding 2, and Helldivers 2 at launch. Marathon players on Steam automatically receive the exclusive Crowbar Weapon Charm (don't say Half-Life 3 confirmed!) when Marathon releases on March 5. Marathon players on Xbox Series X and S, meanwhile, get the exclusive Emerald Clutch Weapon Charm and Emerald Catch Weapon Charm.
