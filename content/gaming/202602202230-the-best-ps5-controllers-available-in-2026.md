When Sony launched the PlayStation 5 in late 2020, it came with an all-new controller, the [DualSense](https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-5-dualsense-controller), that completely redesigned the look and feel of its iconic controller. While it still retained the signature parallel thumbsticks and button layout, it added new features like Haptic Feedback and Adaptive Triggers to provide a deeper sense of immersion while playing. For a while, the DualSense was your only option if you wanted to game on [PS5](https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-review).

Five years later, there are plenty of third-party controllers to choose from, as well as a new console in the [PS5 Pro](https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-ps5-pro). These DualSense alternatives provide options for players looking for a different button layout, more customization, or pro-level features. Check out our full rundown of the best PS5 controllers available in 2026.

## TL;DR: These Are the Best PS5 Controllers

Whether you're interested in additional back buttons to enhance your gameplay or want a more customizable pro-style controller, there are plenty of options available now for PS5 controllers. My colleagues and I have tested and reviewed most of the controllers below and handpicked the best options for most players.

## **1\. PlayStation DualSense**

Suboptimal battery life

For most players, the best PS5 controller is the one that comes in the box. [PlayStation’s DualSense, as we noted in its review](https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-dualsense-controller-review) a few years ago, is unbeatable for a reason. It's packed with features that enhance your experience and immerse you into your gameplay. The adaptive triggers add tension to simulate actions like firing a gun or slowly drawing a bow, while the haptic feedback delivers subtle vibrations that let you feel things like raindrops in [Returnal](https://www.ign.com/articles/returnal-review) or the crunch of snow under your feet in [Astro Bot](https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review).

The DualSense is also built with social gaming in mind. The updated Create button makes it easy to capture screenshots and gameplay clips to share with friends or post online. There’s a built-in microphone for quick multiplayer sessions, and while it’s no match for a dedicated headset, it works well enough. The controller also includes an integrated speaker for in-game audio and a standard headphone jack for wired headsets.

While the DualSense is Sony’s most advanced controller to date, it does have a few drawbacks. Battery life typically ranges from six to 12 hours, and games that fully use the controller’s features can drain it even faster. Like many modern controllers, it is also prone to [stick drift](https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-dualsense-controller-drift-everything-you-need-to-know), which unfortunately does not have a simple fix and often requires purchasing a new controller entirely.

Still, the DualSense is my pick for the best PS5 controller overall. If you're in the market for a second one or want something more stylish than the standard white, Sony has released a [variety of DualSense colors and special editions](https://www.ign.com/articles/all-ps5-dualsense-colors-in-order) over the years to suit just about any taste. There's even a [Marathon-themed DualSense edition](https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-marathon-ps5-dualshock-controller-pulse-elite-headset) coming out in March 2026 you can preorder now.

## 2\. Sony DualSense Edge

### Best Pro-Style PS5 Controller

[![DualSense Edge](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/01/24/screen-shot-2023-01-24-at-9-28-01-am-1674581377051.png?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/mbrO5?object_uuid=21bfe445-588d-473d-b584-640da07b1ca2&t=article "DualSense Edge")

### PlayStation DualSense Edge

Take customizations to another level with this controller, offering interchangeable back buttons and sticks along with tons of other handy features.

Product Specifications

Connectivity

Bluetooth, USB-C

Battery Life

5-6 hours

Weight

325g

PROS

Very customizable

Function button integration

Comfortable back buttons

CONS

Underwhelming battery life

I [reviewed the DualSense Edge](https://www.ign.com/articles/dualsense-edge-review), Sony’s answer to the [Xbox Elite Controller](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/15/xbox-elite-wireless-series-2-controller-review) that offers pro-level features and a wide range of customization options. It retains all of the standard DualSense's core features like adaptive triggers and haptic feedback, but adds a deeper level of control for players looking to elevate their game.

For starters, it includes three types of interchangeable thumbstick caps that can be swapped out depending on your preference or the game you’re playing. Two rear buttons can be easily mapped to any input on the controller, giving you quick access to frequent actions. The thumbstick modules are also user-replaceable, so if you run into [stick drift](https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-dualsense-controller-drift-everything-you-need-to-know), you can [replace just the module](https://zdcs.link/a03xb5?object_uuid=21bfe445-588d-473d-b584-640da07b1ca2&t=article) instead of buying an entirely new controller.

The new Function buttons located beneath each thumbstick allow for intuitive, on-the-fly customization. You can quickly remap controls through a slick user interface and save up to four profiles that can be easily swapped depending on the game you're playing.

While the [DualSense Edge is a strict upgrade over the standard DualSense](https://www.ign.com/articles/dualsense-vs-dualsense-edge-which-controller-should-you-buy) in just about every way, its battery life leaves much to be desired. On average, it lasts about five to six hours on a single charge, which is even shorter than the regular DualSense.

## 3\. Razer Raiju V3 Pro Wireless

### PS5 Controller With the Best Battery Life

[![Raiju V3 Pro](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/13/raiju-square-1770978090801.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/z7RXZ8?object_uuid=21bfe445-588d-473d-b584-640da07b1ca2&t=article "Raiju V3 Pro")

### Razer Raiju V3 Pro

Razer's latest PS5 controller offers long battery life, TMR sticks and competition-focused features.

Product Specifications

Connectivity

2.4GHz wireless, USB-C

Battery Life

36 hours

Weight

258g

PROS

Impressive battery life

Tactile buttons and TMR sticks

Six customizable buttons

CONS

No adaptive triggers

Expensive

If battery life is your biggest concern, the Razer Raiju V3 Pro might be the answer. With nearly 40 hours on a single charge, it ensures you won’t run out of juice at a crucial moment.

Battery life isn't its only standout feature. The Raiju V3 Pro Wireless also features Mecha-Tactile Action Buttons, which feel significantly different than standard membrane buttons. The face buttons and D-pad are incredibly snappy and responsive, requiring less actuation than most controllers. That means faster, more accurate inputs, which could give you an edge in competitive games. You also benefit from TMR sticks, which are much less likely to suffer stick drift after years of use, and Hall Effect triggers which have similar longevity benefits. In my [Raiju V3 Pro review](https://www.ign.com/articles/razer-raiju-v3-pro-controller-review), I found the controls incredibly responsive in timing-sensitive games like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, F1 23, and Battlefield 6.

Six customizable buttons are built into the controller, two on top and four on the back. These work with a satisfying click and provide some much-needed flexibility that helps justify this controller's high price of $220/£199.

Unfortunately, like other third-party wireless PS5 controllers, the Raiju V3 Pro is limited to 250Hz polling rates on PS5, versus up to 2000Hz wired or 1000Hz wireless on PC. It also can't wake the PS5 from deep sleep. These are minor annoyances in the grand scheme of things, but worth mentioning nonetheless.

## 4\. Scuf Reflex Pro

### Best Grips on a PS5 Controller

[![Reflex Pro](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/05/11/screen-shot-2022-05-11-at-1-06-00-pm-1652289954159.png?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/Oyxp2?object_uuid=21bfe445-588d-473d-b584-640da07b1ca2&t=article "Reflex Pro")

### Scuf Reflex Pro

Gamepad offering adaptive triggers and accurate rumble like the DualSense alongside extra features like four manually programmable paddles on the back.

Product Specifications

Connectivity

Bluetooth, USB-C

Battery Life

8 hours

Weight

PROS

Four rear paddles

Variety of colors and faceplates

Comfortable grip

CONS

No haptic feedback

Expensive

Announced just [a year after the PS5 launched](https://www.ign.com/articles/scuf-reflex-pro-fps-ps5-controller), the Scuf Reflex Pro was the first major third-party alternative to the DualSense. Like many Scuf products, it's geared toward competitive players and offers several pro-level features that Sony didn’t include (at the time).

Since then, the DualSense Edge has hit the market and knocked some of the wind out of the Reflex Pro's sails. Still, it remains a solid choice for players looking to elevate their game. One key feature that sets it apart is its four customizable back paddles. They're well-placed and easy to use, providing convenient access to key actions without needing to take your thumbs off the sticks. The controller also has an incredibly comfortable non-slip grip around both stems, keeping you and your hands locked in while gaming.

The Reflex Pro is one of the only third-party controllers to include Sony’s proprietary Adaptive Triggers, but it skips the DualSense’s haptic feedback in favor of traditional rumble. Battery life lands around eight hours, putting it slightly ahead of the DualSense Edge but behind the standard DualSense.

If customization is your thing, Scuf offers a range of vibrant colors and unique faceplates to help your Reflex Pro stand out. It also includes interchangeable thumbsticks you can swap based on your playstyle or comfort preference.

## **5\. Nacon Revolution 5 Pro**

### Best Thumbsticks on a PS5 Controller

[![Revolution 5 Pro](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/12/01/nacon-revolution-5-pro-1701462158887.jpg?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/42p6y?object_uuid=21bfe445-588d-473d-b584-640da07b1ca2&t=article "Revolution 5 Pro")

CONS

No haptic feedback or adaptive triggers

If you've ever experienced [stick drift](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-real-science-behind-controller-drift) on any of your controllers, you know how frustrating it can be. It often leaves your controller nearly unusable, and in many cases, the only solution is to buy a replacement. That can get expensive quickly, especially if it happens more than once. Thankfully, the [Nacon Revolution 5 Pro that I reviewed](https://www.ign.com/articles/nacon-revolution-5-pro-review) uses Hall effect sensors in its thumbstick modules, which virtually eliminates the risk of stick drift.

The Revolution 5 Pro is also highly customizable, making it a great fit for anyone who likes to tinker with their tech. Inside the included carrying case, you'll find a mini tool box containing extra interesting components, including three sets of interchangeable thumbstick toppers that change the shape and height as well as thumbstick guards that reduce travel distance for more responsive movement.

One of the most unique additions is a set of controller weights. These can be added into the controller stems to provide a bit more heft and help distribute the weight more evenly. While the default setup is comfortable, this extra level of customization adds a premium feel that sets it apart from most other controllers.

One of the Revolution 5 Pro's killer features is built-in Bluetooth 5.2, allowing you to effectively bypass the PS5's Bluetooth headphone restriction and pair your headphones directly to the controller. You can even adjust the headphone's volume right from the controller!

## 6\. Victrix Pro BFG

### Best Customizable PS5 Controller

[![Pro BFG](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/16/screenshot-2024-07-16-at-7-37-43-am-1721140676958.png?width=220&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80)](https://zdcs.link/aXddKB?object_uuid=21bfe445-588d-473d-b584-640da07b1ca2&t=article "Pro BFG")

The Victrix Pro BFG is a highly-customizable controller with a modular design, allowing you to tailor it to your exact needs. A reversible left module allows you to swap between the standard PS5 parallel thumbstick layout and offset Xbox layout, providing a solution that will appeal to everyone.

On the right side of the controller, you can remove the standard thumbstick and button module and replace it with a fightpad-style set of controls, adding a dedicated R1 and R2 button that can be customized for fighting games.

It also features interchangeable thumbsticks and gates as well as three different D-pads for added personalization. The four back buttons can be mapped on the fly and a dedicated profile button on the rear of the controller allows you to create and swap between three unique profiles as needed. While it lacks adaptive triggers and haptic feedback, this is a very capable controller aimed at competitive players across genres.

## 7\. Hori Fighting Commander OCTA

Not ideal for non-fighting games

If you're a fan of [fighting games](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-fighting-games) and don't necessarily want a bulky [arcade fight stick](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-fight-stick), then the [Hori Fighting Commander OCTA that I reviewed](https://www.ign.com/articles/hori-fighting-commander-octa-for-ps5-review) might be a great fit for you. It delivers the core features of a traditional fight stick in a more compact, gamepad-style design that fits comfortably in your hands.

The Fighting Commander OCTA is officially licensed by Sony and works with PS5, as well as PS4 and PC through a wired USB connection to ensure minimal input delay.

What makes it ideal for fighting games is its short-throw analog stick with an octagonal gate, which helps you execute combos more easily. It also includes an adjustable circular D-pad for those who prefer 2D-style fighters. On the right side, you'll find six tactile face buttons and two shoulder buttons, all designed for quick access and responsiveness during intense matches.

PlayStation might have its [first official fight stick coming in 2026](https://www.ign.com/articles/sonys-new-wireless-fight-stick-is-named-flexstrike-and-its-coming-in-2026), but right now, the top fight stick goes to the [Pro Arcade FS.](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/12/06/victrix-pro-fs-arcade-stick-review) Victrix hasn’t pulled any punches here; it’s created one of the [best arcade fight sticks](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-fight-stick) available today, featuring lag-free controls that are tournament-ready.  
Each of its eight face buttons uses Sanwa Denshi components, a favorite among fight stick enthusiasts, delivering a responsive feel and a satisfying, audible click. It also features an ergonomically designed wrist rest to reduce fatigue during long sessions, along with a built-in foam pad to keep the fight stick stable and comfortable in your lap.

If you enjoy customizing your gear, you can open the bottom panel to swap in new switches and joysticks. But even right out of the box, the Pro Arcade FS is a premium fight stick that stands above much of the competition. It’s designed specifically for PS5 and includes all the buttons found on a standard DualSense, including the Touchpad, Menu, and Create buttons, so you can access all system features without missing a beat.

Buttons can be hard to press

In 2023, Sony released the [PlayStation Access Controller](https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-access-controller-review) to help players with disabilities enjoy games [more comfortably and for longer periods](https://www.ign.com/articles/my-joy-of-returning-to-playstation-after-a-decade).

It features a fully customizable 360-degree layout that can be tailored through both hardware and software. A wide variety of stick and button caps in different shapes and sizes are included to accommodate diverse physical needs. It also has four expansion ports for connecting additional buttons or specialty trigger switches.

On the software side, users can create up to 30 unique control profiles on the PS5. Three of these can be stored directly on the controller and swapped on the fly with a dedicated button, making it easy to adapt the controller to different games or in-game scenarios.

Sony also took care with the packaging, which is designed to be opened with one hand and minimal effort. Inside, it features loops that can be pulled on either side to reveal organized compartments for all of the controller’s components.

## How to Choose a PS5 Controller

Think about what matters most to you as a player. Are you looking for a feature-rich controller with all the bells and whistles or something more budget-friendly?

Most third-party PS5 controllers include some level of "pro" features aimed at competitive gamers. Customizable back buttons, interchangeable thumbsticks, enhanced grips, and multiple connectivity options are all things to watch for.

Battery life is another key factor. The standard DualSense doesn’t have the longest battery life, so you might want to consider a wired controller or one with a larger battery that can last longer between charges.

If price is a concern, the standard PS5 DualSense is still a great pick. It includes premium features like adaptive triggers, haptic feedback, a built-in microphone and speaker, and more all for under $80 (and often cheaper – it goes on sale fairly often).

Beyond traditional gamepads, you may also want to explore [racing wheels](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-racing-wheels), [fight sticks](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-fight-stick), and [joysticks](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pc-joystick) for a more immersive experience in driving, fighting, and flying games.

## How We Picked the Best PS5 Controllers

After more than five years of testing and reviewing PS5 controllers, I've assembled this list based on several key factors, including design, core features, customization options, battery life, and accessibility. While the standard DualSense will be more than enough for most players, these alternative controllers offer additional features like back buttons, interchangeable thumbsticks, and other pro-level enhancements that can make a real difference in play, competitive and otherwise.

## PlayStation 5 Controller FAQ

### What PlayStation 5 controller doesn’t drift?

Most PS5 controllers are susceptible to [stick drift](https://www.ign.com/wikis/playstation-5/What_To_Do_If_Your_PS5_DualSense_Controller_Drifts), a common issue caused by worn-down potentiometers in the analog sticks. Some high-end gamepads avoid this by using magnetic Hall effect sensors, which are far more durable and resistant to wear. The [Nacon Revolution 5 Pro](https://www.ign.com/articles/nacon-revolution-5-pro-review) is one such controller, virtually eliminating stick drift thanks to its Hall effect sensors.

### How do I fix stick drift on PS5?

If your controller is experiencing stick drift, it may be due to worn-down potentiometers inside the analog sticks, either from regular use or a manufacturing defect. Unfortunately, there is often little you can do to fix the issue yourself. DualSense controllers usually come with a one- or two-year warranty depending on your region, so if yours is still under warranty, it is worth contacting Sony for a repair or replacement. In some cases, the problem may be caused by dirt or debris, so try gently cleaning around the base of the analog stick to see if that resolves it.

### Does the PS5 controller have a headphone jack?

Yes, the DualSense controller has a built-in 3.5mm audio jack at its base that a [PS5 gaming headset](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-headset) or a pair of [headphones](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-over-ear-headphones) can be plugged into. Many other third-party PS5 controllers also feature a headphone jack.

### When do PS5 controllers go on sale?

Although discounts on PlayStation 5 consoles may not happen very often, PS5 controllers do go on sale throughout the year. Overall, the [best time to buy a PS5](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-time-to-buy-a-playstation-5) is also the best time to buy a controller. In terms of sales events, [Amazon Prime Day](https://www.ign.com/events/amazon-prime-day) in July and [Black Friday](https://www.ign.com/events/black-friday) season in November are when you will see the lowest prices on Dualsense controllers. That being said, you can usually also find deals during the [PlayStation Days of Play sale](https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-days-of-play-sale-2025-live) every year.
