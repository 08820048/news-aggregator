Legacy of Kain: Defiance is finally getting the remaster it's long deserved, and in addition to a much nicer looking and playing game, those who purchase the Deluxe Edition will get to play a never-before-seen demo of the canceled sixth Legacy of Kain game, The Dark Prophecy.

Announced today, Legacy of Kain: Defiance Remastered will release on March 3, 2026 for PS5 and PS4, Switch and Switch 2, Xbox, and PC via Steam, GOG, and Epic Games Store. It's developed by Crystal Dynamics and PlayEveryWare, and per franchise general manager Matt McCloskey, is based heavily on "a digitization of this massive archive that we actually found in a closet at Crystal Dynamics San Mateo office."

This is a remaster, not a remake, but there's a lot to it. The graphics, lighting, cinematics, audio, and music player have all gotten a major touch-up, alongside the controls and HUD. New in this version is a third-person "floating" camera view, though you can toggle back to the original camera view if you prefer the old look. There's a new combat tutorial that's a little easier to access for newer players, a photo mode, a cheat menu, and some new localizations the original game didn't have.

The remaster will also feature a line-up of bonus content, including new collectibles, the addition of a number of previously cut lost levels, local level maps, an improved 3D lore map, and a bunch of player character skins. For purchasers of the Deluxe Edition, a comic book reader will also be available containing the Soul Reaver and Defiance comics.

But those who purchase the Deluxe Edition will also get access to something rather astonishing: a demo of a cancelled game. It's long been public knowledge that Crystal Dynamics was working on a sequel to Defiance back in 2003. Internally referred to as Legacy of Kain 6 and rumored to be subtitled "The Dark Prophecy", its existence and some details about it were leaked over time, but the game itself was cancelled before it could be formally announced. Crystal Dynamics has assembled a demo of that game from archived files, and made it available to play in the Deluxe Edition, giving a glimpse at a Legacy of Kain that could have been.

All of this will be available on March 3, leaving plenty of time to prepare for the release later that month of a [brand new Legacy of Kain game](https://www.ign.com/articles/legacy-of-kain-ascendance-the-first-new-legacy-of-kain-game-in-over-two-decades-is-out-next-month), entitled Ascendance, which we also learned about today. This pair of releases marks a major revival for the franchise, as the last "new" game was the original Legacy of Kain: Defiance over two decades ago in 2003 (which [we gave an 8/10 all those years ago!](https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/12/18/legacy-of-kain-defiance-review)), and the only release since has been [Soul Reaver 1 & 2 Remastered in 2024](https://www.ign.com/articles/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-leaked-via-playstation-store-ahead-of-state-of-play-broadcast).
