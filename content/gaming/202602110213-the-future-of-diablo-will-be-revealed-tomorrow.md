Blizzard Entertainment is just one day away from unveiling the future of Diablo with its 30th Anniversary Spotlight.

Just like last week’s [gargantuan Overwatch Spotlight](https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-spotlight-2026-everything-announced-updating-live), the February 11 presentation is said to show an extended look at new announcements and updates for the classic dungeon-crawling franchise. That means reveals for [Diablo 4](https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv), [Diablo 2: Resurrected](https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-ii-resurrected), and [Diablo Immortal](https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-immortal), as all three games seek to keep players scrounging for loot in 2026.

Unlike the presentation for its hero shooter, Blizzard has given fans a taste of what to expect. Diablo 4, which launched in June of 2023 and received its [Vessel of Hatred](https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred) expansion in October 2024, is barreling toward the launch of its next expansion, [Lord of Hatred](https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4-expansion-lord-of-hatred-revealed-adds-not-1-but-2-new-classes-including-the-paladin-the-game-awards-2025), this April. We already know one of its two new classes will be the Paladin, but [Blizzard says](https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24259137/tune-in-to-the-diablo-30th-anniversary-spotlight) the Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight will come with a look at the yet-to-be-revealed class, too. The World of Warcraft company also teased that fans should expect a deep dive into “major updates to skill trees” as well as its new endgame systems.

Diablo 2: Resurrected is an unexpected but welcome addition to the Spotlight. Blizzard has been coy when it comes to what it will show for its Diablo 2 remake, only [teasing](https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24246296/diablo-ii-resurrected-ladder-season-13-coming-soon) that “there’s a lot we want to share with you,” as it prepares for the launch of Ladder Season 13 February 20. Some are hoping for quality-of-life changes while others speculate about a potential Steam release, but with the 2021 remake largely remaining faithful to the original 2000 experience, it’s hard to say what its future holds.

Finally, there’s Diablo Immortal, Blizzard’s 2022 mobile spinoff. A closer look at the 2026 roadmap is locked in, as the company has told players its ongoing story will carry them “deeper into a world shaped by corruption, conflict, and consequences.” Its [blog post](https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24250353/witness-the-diablo-30th-anniversary-spotlight) on the matter promises more information about a new class, a new region, and “the return of a malevolent force.”

The Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight premieres tomorrow, February 11, at 2pm PT/5pm ET, and can be streamed on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/diablo) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnAsWN-6hvw). Keep an eye on IGN for a breakdown of all of the biggest announcements and reveals but, in the meantime, you can check out our reviews for [Diablo 4](https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4-review), [Diablo 2: Resurrected](https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-2-resurrected-review), and [Diablo Immortal](https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-immortal-review).
