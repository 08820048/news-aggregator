[Magic: The Gathering](https://www.ign.com/games/magic-the-gathering-trading-card-game) has kicked off its [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles set](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-where-to-buy-updated-2026) prerelease weekend, but one product has been tougher to find than even Collector Boosters - the Pizza Bundle.

New for this set, it’s a bundle of packs and bonus goodies intended to look like, well, a pizza box, and it includes a Collector Booster - but [is it worth picking up at Amazon right now](https://zdcs.link/aA8ggj?object_uuid=3af2246a-a09e-41e9-a40d-a376b134cfb5&t=article)?

### TMNT Pizza Bundle

## Is MTG’s Pizza Box As Tasty As It Sounds?

Included in the TMNT Pizza Bundle are nine Play Boosters, a Collector Booster, two Promo Cards, full-art basic lands in foil, 25 regular full-art lands, and a spindown life counter exclusive to the bundle.

Taking the lands and life counter out of the equation, you’re getting $92.91 of value in Play Boosters, plus a $37.99 Collector Booster. That takes you to $100.90, for a box that’ll set you back $149.99. Are the box, lands, and spindown worth almost $50? It’s your call, but for less than that, you can get [a Draft Night box at a discount](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-tmnt-draft-night-box-where-to-buy) and get the same number of Collector Boosters but more Play Boosters.

If you’ve been holding out for Magic’s latest set, it’s a good time to pick some up. As we explained yesterday, [Collector Boosters are back in stock](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtle-set-launches-next-week-and-collector-boosters-just-got-a-sizable-discount-at-amazon), and at a discount. Elsewhere, the Turtle Power Commander Deck (which includes all the Turtles, Splinter, and Shredder) is [down to $59](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-next-precon-deck-is-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtle-themed-and-its-already-discounted-just-a-few-weeks-from-launch) and the [non-Pizza box bundle is $63.99](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-set-launches-next-month-and-the-bundle-is-discounted-already).

Draft Night, which includes Play Boosters for drafting and a Collector Booster to use as a prize, [is down to $94.99 from $119.99](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-tmnt-draft-night-box-back-in-stock-and-discounted-at-amazon).
