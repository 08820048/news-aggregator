Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said he "fully understands the legitimate concerns of our teams" after the [firm's restructuring plan](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-reveals-new-creative-house-structure-cancels-games-and-announces-final-round-of-cost-cutting-and-studio-closures-to-drive-200m-savings) and subsequent layoffs.

Speaking to [Variety](https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/), Guillemot noted that "changes of this scale naturally raise questions and create tension, particularly when they impact people's routines."

Following its restructuring announcement, Ubisoft [launched a voluntary redundancy process to cut 200 jobs](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-redundancy-process-to-cut-200-jobs-from-paris-head-office) at its Paris headquarters. Last week, [40 roles were cut from Ubisoft Toronto](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-toronto-impacted-by-layoffs-40-roles-impacted).

"My commitment is to listen, lead responsibly, and keep our teams engaged," he said. "At the same time, we can't ignore that we are part of an industry that is more competitive and demanding than ever.

"Delivering at the level of quality and ambition our players expect requires strong alignment, speed of execution, and close collaboration. The decisions we are making are guided by that reality."

When asked whether there would be further layoffs, Guillemot reiterated that "the €200 million in additional cost reductions will include selective restructuring across the company."

"That said, our primary focus for aligning the organisation with our long-term goals remains disciplined workforce management, meaning prioritising voluntary departures while carefully controlling recruitment for replacements and new roles."

In response to Ubisoft's restructuring announcement, French games industry union Solidaires Informatique said "[anger and despair \[was\] reigning supreme](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/anger-and-despair-reigning-supreme-at-ubisoft-following-restructuring-plan-says-union)" at the developer.

The union called for an end to the cost-cutting plan, maintaining and extending remote work, and pay rises.

Over 1,200 Ubisoft employees [went on strike earlier this month](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/at-least-1200-ubisoft-workers-strike-in-response-to-recent-restructuring), with demonstrations mostly in France and some in Ubisoft Milan. Ubisoft later stated that 538 staff reported themselves as being on strike.

In response, Guillemot said: "I believe more transparency and open dialogue with our teams, in all its forms and especially in times of major change, are essential."

Elsewhere in the interview, Guillemot addressed criticism of the appointment of his son, Charlie Guillemot, [as co-CEO of the Tencent-backed Ubisoft subsidiary Vantage Studios](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-appoints-north-american-md-christophe-derennes-and-charlie-guillemot-as-co-ceos-of-new-tencent-spinoff).

"Ubisoft was created as a family company, and our strong heritage helps us take a long-term view, prioritising sustainable growth, creative ambition, and continuity over short-term cycles," he said.

"I strongly believe that Christophe Derennes and Charlie are the right leaders as co-CEOs of Vantage Studios. They bring complementary strengths and experience that make them well-suited for the role. Their appointment was based on their skills, track record, and fit for the role."

Yesterday, Vantage Studios [announced its new leadership team for Assassin's Creed](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-picks-three-series-veterans-for-new-assassins-creed-leadership-team). It includes three Ubisoft veterans: Martin Schelling, head of the Assassin's Creed brand; Jean Guesdon, head of content; and François de Billy, head of production excellence.
