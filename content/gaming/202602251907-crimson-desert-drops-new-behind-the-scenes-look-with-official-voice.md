Open-world action-adventure game [Crimson Desert](https://www.ign.com/games/crimson-desert) is coming on March 19 and a new IGN Fan Fest 2026 behind-the-scenes look at the game gives the cast of voice actors a chance to add some more fuel to the hype fire.

Crimson Desert stars Rebecca Hanssen as the voice of the fighter Damiane, Stewart Scudamore as the orc with the impressive axe Oongka, and Alec Newman as main character Greymane Kliff Macduff. All three give an insight into working on the project and bringing their particular characters to life.

"Oongka is a nomadic warrior," Scudamore says in the clip. "I think he has a passion for everything that is fighting for the cause, for his people, for his tribe, and for the Greymanes. First impressions, you're thinking, what can I bring to the table that I can connect? What's the in? His DNA was very economical."

"With Oongka, what surprised me was that he was more of a philosophical orc," Scudamore continues. "He had that sort of world-wise nomadic element. And what I found challenging for Oongka is that he often communicated in grunt, but it was finding those levels of grunt that was challenging."

Crimson Desert will be released on March 19 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PC (Steam and Epic Games Store), and the Mac App Store.
