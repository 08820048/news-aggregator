### YUNZII AL71 75% Full Aluminum Mechanical Keyboard

The YUNZII AL71 is a compact 75% (71-key) mechanical keyboard for both Windows and Mac PCs. Both the top and bottom shell are made of a CNC milled silver anodized aluminum, making it feel heavier and more premium than standard plastic keyboards. "Crystal White" silent linear switches and keycaps are included, but they can be swapped out with 3-pin or 5-pin mechanical switches and most aftermarket keycaps of your choosing. The keyboard is gasket mounted, which means the internal components are sandwiched in layers of poron foam for a softer typing experience and pleasant sound profile. The plate is made of polycarbonate, which is a more flexible material used for "thwocky" keyboards.

The AL71 keyboard offers three modes of connectivity: (1) traditional wired over USB Type-C, (2) wireless Bluetooth, or (3) 2.4GHz wireless with the included USB dongle. An internal 4,500mAh lithium battery keeps it topped up for several days before needing a recharge. Nowadays a keyboard is incomplete without some form of RGB, and this keyboard has it in spades with south-facing RGB LEDs under every key and RGB strips along the side of the case.
