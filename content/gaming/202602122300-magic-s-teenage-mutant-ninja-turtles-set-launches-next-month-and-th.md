[Magic: The Gathering](https://www.ign.com/games/magic-the-gathering-trading-card-game) is enjoying a great set in [Lorwyn Eclipsed](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-lorwyn-eclipsed-most-expensive-cards), but the [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-where-to-buy-2026) are about to emerge from the sewers in a few weeks.

Ahead of the launch of the new set on March 6, Magic fans looking for a Universes Beyond product can pick up the [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Bundle at Amazon for just $54.99](https://zdcs.link/z3OvwE?object_uuid=6c475843-1de1-4dc7-8174-c0f761cf792e&t=article).

### TMNT Bundle

## Save Over 20% On This MTG x TMNT Bundle

Amazon’s deal knocks 21% off the list price (which would be $69.99). That means you’re paying $6.11 per pack for the 9 Play Boosters inside, but that doesn’t take into account the promo card inside and 30 Lands you can use to build a deck.

Those lands are split between standard, full-art, and foil ones, and you get a spindown life counter, too.

For context, splitting it between 9 packs without the discount means you’re paying $7.77. The math doesn’t quite match up exactly because of those additive pieces, like a storage box and promo cord, but it’s something to consider if you wanted a series of packs without wanting to splash out on a box of 30 of them.

Do the preorder discounts suggest we should be worried about the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles set? We’re not so sure yet (we are awaiting card previews at the time of writing), but we’re pleased to see discounts across multiple 2026 sets already.

For more deals on Magic’s TMNT set, be sure to check out the [Turtle Power Commander Deck, also discounted at Amazon](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-next-precon-deck-is-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtle-themed-and-its-already-discounted-just-a-few-weeks-from-launch), while [June’s Marvel Super Heroes set](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gatherings-marvel-set-doesnt-launch-until-june-but-its-discounted-already) is also seeing discounts nice and early. The [Lorwyn Eclipsed Commander Decks are still on offer,](https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-lorwyn-eclipsed-commander-decks-are-30-each-with-this-bundle) too.
