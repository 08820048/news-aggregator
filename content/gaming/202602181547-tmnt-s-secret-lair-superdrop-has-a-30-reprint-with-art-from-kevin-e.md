Wizards of the Coast dubbed Feb. 17 “Turtle Tuesday” and used it as an opportunity to debut the upcoming [_Magic: The Gathering – Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_](https://www.polygon.com/mtg-tmnt-spoilers-cards-magic-the-gathering-commander-precon/) crossover set, complete with the surprise announcement of the [Secret Lair](https://www.polygon.com/mtg-dnd-dungeons-and-dragons-secret-lair-superdrop-february-2026/) [Totally TubuLair Superdrop](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/secret-lair-totally-tubulair-superdrop).

As with most Secret Lairs, the flashy art is only half the story. Beneath the neon ooze and VHS-era nostalgia are some genuinely valuable reprints, including one nearly $30 Ninja staple that hasn’t seen meaningful attention in about a decade. For Commander players, that alone may justify the price of admission. For collectors, the fact that [TMNT](https://www.polygon.com/tmnt-toys-2026-playmates-final-line-toy-fair-preview/) co-creator [Kevin Eastman](https://www.polygon.com/mtg-tmnt-doubling-season/) illustrated one of the Drops adds another layer of appeal. And for fans of Stan Sakai’s Usagi Yojimbo, one drop here is a must-buy. Per usual, each Drop comes in non-foil for $29.99 and foil for $39.99, with a few different bundle options available. Let’s take a look at what each has to offer.

_Note: The prices listed next to each card below are a reflection of the current market value for the cheapest versions of that particular card, aggregated from sites like_ [_Scryfall_](https://scryfall.com/) _and_ [_TCG Player_](https://www.tcgplayer.com/)_._

## VHS Villains

-   1x Delver of Secrets // Insectile Aberration ($0.17)
-   1x Higure, the Still Wind as "Shredder, Criminal Mastermind" ($10.39)
-   1x Species Specialist ($11.78)
-   1x Rampaging Baloths as "Stampeding Brutes" ($0.25)
-   1x Triskelion as "Krang's Android" ($0.23)

VHS Villains doesn’t really have strong reprint value. You could buy all of these singles for less than the cost of this Drop. But there’s some seriously fun art that looks like retro VHS cases. [Species Specialist](https://scryfall.com/card/c20/47/species-specialist) is the best card in the bunch. It’s great in any kind of typal deck focusing on a single creature type, allowing you to draw a card whenever a creature of the chosen type dies (whether it’s yours or your opponent’s). [Higure, the Still Wind](https://scryfall.com/card/pca/18/higure-the-still-wind) has huge value in ninja decks specifically, allowing you to cheat a ninja from your deck into your hand if he deals combat damage to a player.

[Delver of Secrets // Insectile Aberration](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/609611/magic-innistrad-remastered-delver-of-secrets?page=1&Language=English) is pitch-perfect flavor for TMNT’s Baxter Stockman but doesn’t offer much in terms of playability outside of Pauper (it used to be a Legacy staple). Similarly, [Rampaging Baloths](https://scryfall.com/card/eoc/104/rampaging-baloths) feels great as Bebop and Rocksteady with a very strong landfall ability generating tokens, but at a cost of six mana, that’s a bit expensive. Then, [Triskelion](https://scryfall.com/card/moc/387/triskelion) feels a tad uninspired for Krang’s Android.

## The Mighty Mutanimals

-   1x Deepglow Skate as "Man Ray, Eco Avenger" ($0.28)
-   1x Pirated Copy as "Slash, Evil Turtle from Dimension X" ($20.01)
-   1x Kediss, Emberclaw Familiar as "Mondo Gecko, Esquire" ($5.43)
-   1x Hardened Scales ($2.39)
-   1x Triumph of the Hordes as "Mutanimals United" ($17.50)

[Pirated Copy](https://scryfall.com/card/j22/16/pirated-copy) is the highest-value reprint in The Mighty Mutanimals, copying any creature on the board — even if it’s an odd choice for Slash. [Triumph of the Hordes](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/39595/magic-new-phyrexia-triumph-of-the-hordes?Language=English&page=1) is a close second in terms of price for an even better card. For four mana, it gives all of your creatures +1/+1, trample, and infect (which combines wither and poison counters).

[Kediss, Emberclaw Familiar](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/226634/magic-commander-legends-kediss-emberclaw-familiar?Language=English&page=1) is an exceptional partner Commander that makes it so that whenever one of your Commanders deals combat damage to a player, that copies to all other opponents. [Hardened Scales](https://scryfall.com/card/lcc/243/hardened-scales) is a must-include in any green deck based on +1/+1 counters. Somehow, [Deepglow Skate](https://scryfall.com/card/c16/7/deepglow-skate) — a card that doubles the number of counters on any kind of permanent — is the lowest value card here. Altogether, this is definitely the best Drop of the bunch in terms of value.

## The Last Ronin

-   1x Settle the Wreckage ($2.25)
-   1x Mental Misstep ($9.33)
-   1x Ink-Eyes, Servant of Oni as "Splinter, Vengeful Sensei" ($7.40)
-   1x Anger ($1.06)
-   1x Chord of Calling ($4.56)

If there’s one entry in this Superdrop where the flavor absolutely nails it, it’s The Last Ronin, based on the critically accalimed comic book miniseries from IDW Publishing. The headliner here is [Mental Misstep](https://scryfall.com/card/nph/38/mental-misstep), a staple that’s long hovered just under the double-digit mark. [Ink-Eyes, Servant of Oni](https://scryfall.com/card/pca/33/ink-eyes-servant-of-oni) as Splinter, Vengeful Sensei might be the most inspired pairing in the entire Superdrop. Stealing cards out of an opponent’s graveyard is always powerful, and the fact that it can regenerate for only two mana makes it even better.

[Chord of Calling](https://scryfall.com/card/rvr/134/chord-of-calling) remains super flexible as a way to tutor any creature onto the board (with the right mana). [Settle the Wreckage](https://scryfall.com/card/plst/XLN-34/settle-the-wreckage) can function as a game-winning maneuver under the right circumstances. [Anger](https://scryfall.com/card/afc/113/anger) offers one of the best and easiest ways to give all of your creatures haste. This is probably the most flavorful Drop in the bunch.

## Featuring: Kevin Eastman (Colors & Inks variants)

-   1x Loxodon Gatekeeper ($0.97)
-   1x Sakashima's Student ($28.38)
-   1x Throat Slitter ($2.84)
-   1x Guttersnipe ($0.23)

The co-creator of the Turtles lends his artistic talents to this Drop, which comes in a full-color version and a black-and-white ink variant. [Sakashima's Student](https://scryfall.com/card/pca/24/sakashimas-student) is the real blowout here — easily the most valuable card in the entire Superdrop. It remains one of the most efficient clone effects in Commander. Thanks to ninjutsu, it enters the battlefield for just two mana as a copy of the best creature in play and isn’t susceptible to counterspells. And because it stays a Ninja even after copying something else, it keeps typal synergies intact while doubling down on whatever bomb it mimics.

[Throat Slitter](https://scryfall.com/card/pca/37/throat-slitter) offers clean removal in ninja decks, [Guttersnipe](https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/217/guttersnipe) remains a budget all-star in spell-slinger decks, and [Loxodon Gatekeeper](https://scryfall.com/card/rav/25/loxodon-gatekeeper) is a reliable way to deeply frustrate opponents in your pod.

## Featuring: Stan Sakai

-   1x Baylen, the Haymaker as "Miyamoto Usagi" ($0.66)
-   1x Felidar Retreat as "Katsuichi's Peace" ($1.59)
-   1x Master of Ceremonies ($16.98)
-   1x Second Harvest ($1.24)
-   1x Sunforger as "The Grass-Cutting Sword" ($3.71)

The legendary creator of Usagi Yojimbo brings a different artistic style to this drop with [Master of Ceremonies](https://scryfall.com/card/ncc/18/master-of-ceremonies) as the headliner. Few cards are more fun than this one in Commander pods because it forces all opponents to make a choice that benefits you while warping the power structure at the table.

[Sunforger](https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/473/sunforger) remains a hugely powerful piece of red-white equipment that lets you reliably pull instants out of your deck and cast them for almost free. [Second Harvest](https://scryfall.com/card/inr/213/second-harvest) is a powerful finisher in any token-heavy deck, regardless of kind. [Felidar Retreat](https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/574/felidar-retreat) offers a huge boon for white cat decks and even moreso for +1/+1 counter decks. Despite being the cheapest card here, [Baylen, the Haymaker](https://scryfall.com/card/blb/205/baylen-the-haymaker) is a very fun Commander for token-heavy decks.

The Totally TubuLair Superdrop goes live March 2, 2026.
