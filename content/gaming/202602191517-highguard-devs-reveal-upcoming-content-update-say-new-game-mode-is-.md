It's been a weird week in the world of [_Highguard_](https://www.polygon.com/highguard/). A dev affected by [recent layoffs at Wildlight Entertainment](https://www.polygon.com/highguard-developer-wildlight-entertainment-layoffs/) has partially [blamed players](https://www.polygon.com/highguard-developer-post-failure-gamer-slander/) for the game's [tumultuous launch](https://www.polygon.com/highguard-launch-rocky-start/). A report emerged alleging that [_Highguard_ was secretly funded](https://www.polygon.com/highguard-funding-tencent/) by Chinese gaming megalith Tencent. [The game's official website is still down](https://www.polygon.com/highguard-website-down/), with PR refusing to comment. (Though a current Wildlight employee stated on Discord that "\[the\] reputational damage \[is\] already done.") But now, Wildlight says a game update is coming "later this week," and a new game mode is currently in the works.

"This patch is purely content focused, with a brand new Base and a powerful new Raid Tool added to the game, along with new offerings in the Store," Wildlight shared via a [post on X](https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2024305432991535353).

The game's new base, Cloudreach, is a large "fortified airship" with perches for snipers and ventilation shafts players can traverse (or fling grenades into). The update also features a new Raid Tool: the Lockpick. This tool allows players to fire darts that temporarily disable doors and windows, allowing easy access to enemy bases. These darts also leave behind an energy field that gives friendly players a speed boost, but damages, slows, and highlights enemies that get too close. The update also features new cosmetic bundles and a new mount, an Owlbear-like creature called a Moonbruin.

Wildlight didn't specify exactly when this new update will go live, but it will presumably arrive on or before Saturday, given the studio's statement that the update is scheduled for "later this week." The post also mentioned plans for the game's next update, which will feature a new game mode. "We are also working on our next patch, \[in\] which we aim to bring a new game mode focused on the Raid experience, as well as some balance adjustments to weapons, among other things," the post reads.

Wildlight has not yet shared the patch notes for this week's update, nor any info on when players may see the new game mode.
