Somehow, [Stu Macher](https://www.polygon.com/matthew-lillard-ruin-scream-7-stu-macher/) returned. This isn't a spoiler — it's arguably the biggest selling point for [_Scream 7_](https://www.polygon.com/scream-7-neve-campell-returns-review/), which brings back much of the original slasher-comedy's cast, including Neve Campbell as Sydney Prescott, Courteney Cox as Gale Summers, and most confusingly, [Matthew Lillard](https://www.polygon.com/matthew-lillard-twin-peaks-the-return-david-lynch-interview/) as Stu.

Stu's return in _Scream 7_ makes about as much sense as Emperor Palpatine's return in [_Star Wars: Episode IX — The Rise of Skywalker_](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/12/18/21024586/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-review-spoiler-free/). In both cases, a flailing franchise promises to resurrect a fan-favorite villain who famously died on-screen in a movie several decades earlier. And in both cases, the marketing played up that return, while the movie itself failed to do anything interesting with the opportunity.

But the comparisons don’t end there. The most recent three Scream movies, beginning with the 2022 [requel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB68-c8GAiA), [_Scream_](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22882012/scream-review-2022-meta-horror/), and followed by [_Scream VI_](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23630723/scream-6-review-cast-hayden-panettiere-return/) and _Scream 7_ (this naming scheme is as evil as the Sith), have some surprising parallels to the last three Star Wars movies (aka, the sequel trilogy). In both cases, what began as an earnest attempt to reboot a beloved franchise ultimately devolved into nostalgia slop, leading to the (apparent) resurrection of an iconic movie villain who probably should have stayed dead and buried.

Tracing those similarities may help reveal why Scream went wrong — and where the franchise could be headed next. But first, we need to answer one pivotal question… Is Stu Macher actually back from the dead?

**\[Ed. note:** Spoilers ahead for the ending of _Scream 7_.\]

Unlike Palpatine, Stu has not actually returned.

In _Scream 7_, Lillard’s serial killer terrorizes his old high-school classmate Sydney through a series of video calls. At first, everyone assumes it’s some sort of AI DeepFake, but when Sydney and Gale visit a nearby psychiatric hospital, they’re told that a man who looks exactly like Stu, and has amnesia from a nasty head injury, had been living there for decades — until he was released a few days earlier.

Except this turns out to be a misdirect. The hospital guard who fed them that lie is actually the killer (well, one of them) and he’s also an AI expert capable of creating incredibly accurate DeepFakes, because sure, why not. _Scream 7_’s final Ghostface reveal is much less interesting than the version of this story where Stu really is alive. On the plus side, this version lets writer-director Kevin Williamson bring Lillard back without undermining the original _Scream_, which he also wrote.

Considering the [wild hoops](https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2020/3/6/21167764/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-novelization-palpatine-clone-rey-kylo-changes/) Star Wars had to jump through to explain Palpatine’s return, it seems like Williamson made the right choice. But then again, the actual right choice was probably not to bring Lillard back at all. But did Williamson ever have a chance, or was he doomed to fail from the moment he returned to the troubled franchise?

## Scream, Star Wars, and the sequel trilogy curse

There’s an interesting parallel between the Scream and Star Wars sequel trilogies. [_Star Wars: Episode VII — The Force Awakens_](https://www.polygon.com/2015/12/16/10313164/star-wars-the-force-awakens-review/) essentially perfected the legacy sequel in 2015, bringing back franchise stars Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford, while also introducing a new generation of heroes and villains who could carry the story forward. _Scream_ pulled off a similar feat in 2022, introducing a new “core four” (Jenna Ortega, Melissa Barrera, Mason Gooding, and Jasmin Savoy Brown) while also bringing back series stalwarts Campbell, Cox, and David Arquette. The movie even features a [Force ghost](https://collider.com/scream-5-why-that-cameo-doesnt-work/) (sort of) and kills off Arquette’s Dewey Riley in an echo of Han Solo’s death in _The Force Awakens_.

A year later, _Scream VI_ carried the franchise forward while making some ambitious changes. The setting moved from Woodsboro, California to New York City. Ghostface wielded a shotgun. And Sydney decided to sit this one out ([due to Neve Campbell’s salary dispute](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2026-02-25/neve-campbell-scream-salary-dispute-back-scream-7), but still). Unlike [_The Last Jedi_](https://www.polygon.com/2017/12/12/16749732/star-wars-review-the-last-jedi-rian-johnson-luke-rey/), which took even bigger swings with its franchise, _Scream VI_ didn’t spark any controversies. It wasn’t the best Scream movie ever, but it was still a fun time, with some of the franchise’s signature meta-horror commentary.

Instead, the controversy came later that year when the studio [fired Barrera](https://variety.com/2023/film/news/scream-producers-explain-melissa-barrera-fired-antisemitism-1235804914/) from _Scream 7_ for her comments about the genocide in Gaza. Soon afterward, [Ortega left the project](https://deadline.com/2023/11/jenna-ortega-scream-departure-melissa-barrera-wednesday-1235634200/), allegedly for unrelated scheduling reasons. Christopher Landon, who had been brought on to direct _Scream 7_, also [quit](https://variety.com/2023/film/news/christopher-landon-exits-scream-7-director-1235805735/) in the wake of Barrera’s firing.

Facing controversies and angry fans, Star Wars and Scream both needed a silver-bullet solution. And in both cases, that involved bringing back a trusted director and an iconic villain.

We all know how this went for Star Wars. _The Force Awakens_ director J.J. Abrams returned to close out the trilogy and brought Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) along with him. The movie was a relative financial success, but a critical flop. Even worse, it managed to unite a divided fandom against it. Pretty much everyone agreed _The Rise of Skywalker_ was a terrible movie, regardless of whether they felt the previous entry, _The Last Jedi_, was a [brilliant franchise subversion](https://www.polygon.com/2017/12/12/16749732/star-wars-review-the-last-jedi-rian-johnson-luke-rey/) or [woke garbage](https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/2/17927554/star-wars-last-jedi-backlash-study-rian-johnson-trolls-russian-bots-political-far-right/).

The fallout was brutal. Lucasfilm and Disney were so traumatized by the response to _Rise of Skywalker_ that it’s taken them seven years to release a new Star Wars movie. That movie, [_The Mandalorian & Grogu_](https://www.polygon.com/star-wars-2026-movies/), arrives at a time when the franchise feels less relevant than ever. It has the potential to either rescue Star Wars, or confirm its demise as a cultural touchstone.

Scream was never as big as Star Wars, but the horror-comedy franchise is potentially heading down the same dark path. Critics are already [lambasting](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/scream_7/reviews) _Scream 7_ as messy nostalgia bait. If the fans follow suit, the series will be in serious trouble. Williamson [recently said](https://deadline.com/2026/02/kevin-williamson-neve-campbell-brainstorming-scream-8-1236737021/) he’s already working on ideas for _Scream 8_, but if history is any guide, it may be a very long wait before Ghostface rears his head again.
