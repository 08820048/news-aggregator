Tired of the same old black brick of a power bank that litters the marketplace? If you're looking for something with top-notch quality and style, then you should check out the premium power banks, chargers, and cables from mfish. These head turners are a step up in craftsmanship, design, and features compared to the standard Anker, Baseus, and Iniu products that you'll generally find on Amazon.

Better yet, they don't carry a hefty price premium especially with these extra incentives. Save an [extra 15% off sitewide](https://zdcs.link/znBVX3?object_uuid=6d3a5d0e-1637-47ff-ba0d-1d7a40d60507&t=article) after coupon code: "**mfish×ign15**" and this stacks with any instant discounts. Also, most items also include a free 4-in-1 USB cable, which usually costs $20. Shipping is free on orders totalling $39.99 and up, otherwise it's $6.

Nothing that mfish sells is "ordinary", but I've highlighted some of their more unique offerings below.

The mfish E-Monster power bank boasts an eye catching that's bound to turn heads. The decorative side is protected by a textured tempered glass that gives it a much more premium look and feel than the plastic power banks that are all too common nowadays. Both 5,000mAh and 10,000mAh MagSafe models are Qi2 certified and rated for up to 15W of wireless power delivery. There's also a 20W USB Type-C port if you need faster charging.

The 5,000mAh model is very slim, measuring a mere 0.3" thin and weighing 4.4 ounces. It's priced at $33.99 after coupon. The 10,000mAh gives you twice the battery capacity, but it's also considerably thicker and heavier and also includes a built-in kickstand. This model is priced at $49.29 with free shipping after coupon. Both include a 4-in-1 charging cable

Automatically added when you order the E-Tank power station

The mfish E-Rhino power station is popular amongst influencers because it looks so very cool with its illuminated ringed power outlets. This is a compact, all-inclusive power station that is hefty enough to sit on your desk without moving around. Total outputs include three standard 3-prong AC outlets rated for up to 1,250W each and four USB-C ports with 240W maximum power output (140W max for a single port). The three AC outlets are raised and encased in a plastic sheath that can be illuminated to your choice of color. The lights aren't super bright so it won't distract you.

With the coupon, the price drops to $110.49 plus you get a free mfish Armored Dragon 6ft 240W 4-way charging cable. It's currently priced at [$139.99 on Amazon](https://zdcs.link/aN3643?object_uuid=6d3a5d0e-1637-47ff-ba0d-1d7a40d60507&t=article) with no cable included.

## Aroma Bee 6ft 240W USB-C Scented? Cable for $4.24

"_**Aromatherapy cables"**_

### mfish Aroma Bee 240W USB-C Charging Cable

mFish's "Aroma Bee" charging cable is down to just $4.24 from its original $16 list price. These cables are thicker than your standard USB cable but in a good way; they look and feel more durable, but they still bend well and comes in fun colors like pastel pink, blue, or purple. I'll mention that the "liquid silicone" sheath that mfish uses feels ultra silky smooth to the touch, and it's much nicer than any other silicone cable I've used before. They're terminated with RGB illuminated aluminum alloy connectors for that extra bling factor. It's rated for 240W, which is the max power rating for any USB cable.

What's _really_ unique, though, is that the terminal ends acts as an electric diffuser. You read that right; there's a spot in the cable end to add in a few drops of oil for a little bit of aromatherapy. I believe some diffuser oil is actually included as well. I don't know if I'd use that feature myself, but for $4.24, I can't think of another cable with more features.

One of the more innovative mfish products is its Super Mushroom 20,000mAh 100W modular power bank. It boasts a cylindrical design with a translucent plastic outer casing that showcases the stylish lithium battery cells inside. What's really neat is that two of these power banks can be stacked together to form a single unit with a 40,000mAh capacity.

The coupon code doesn't work on this product because there's already an instant discount. The $99.99 sku drops to $80 in-cart and includes a single 20,000mAh power bank. The $199.99 kit drops to $160 in-cart and gets you **two** 20,000mAh power banks plus (1) a link module to stack the two power banks together, (2) a flashlight module, and (3) a magnetic charging module. Whatever package you decide on, you get a free mfish Armored Dragon 6ft 240W 4-way charging cable.
