Every car owner should have a tire inflator on hand in case of emergencies. If the only reason stopping you is the cost, then this deal should give you no more excuse. Amazon is offering **Prime members** the [UZNY cordless tire inflator and air compressor](https://zdcs.link/z648Nj?object_uuid=3e0507d0-ea16-42a3-a3a4-d837968b97b8&t=article) for just $13.19 with coupon code: "**OJGX3TUV**". It may not be labeled as an official [Presidents Day sale](https://www.ign.com/events/presidents-day-sales) deal on Amazon, but I'm starting to see the sales begin this week with early Presidents Day discounts across retailers, ramping up ahead of the official holiday on Monday.

Many, if not most, of these off-brand tire inflators on Amazon are probably rebadged variants of the same product, so you basically just want to get the lowest price. They might not have as many fancy features as other more expensive models, but they get the job done and that's what matters.

## UZNY Cordless Tire Inflator and Air Compressor for $13.19

### UZNY 150PSI Car Tire Inflator and Air Compressor

The UZNY tire inflator and air compressor features an internal lithium-ion battery. Cordless inflators are much more convenient to use because they don't need to be plugged in and can be charged with a standard USB Type-C cable. The compressor is rated for a maximum pressure of 150 PSI and can refill a 195/65 R15 tire from 28 to 36 PSI in under one minute. It also has an essential auto-stop feature to prevent you from dangerously overfilling your tires.

Like most tire inflators, this model can also be used as a cordless compressor to inflate other things as well, like bicycle tires, balls, inflatables, and more. The digital display is easy to read and can switch among four different units of measurements: psi, kpa, bar and kg/cm². It's also equipped with a USB output so that it **can be used as an impromptu** [**power bank**](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-portable-charger) **to charge your phone or mobile electronics in a pinch.**

Most people will get this tire inflator to keep their tires topped up, however, it will come in handy during the real emergencies when you get a flat. If your tire has a puncture, there's no point filling it back up if it's going to leak again, so be sure you also have a [tire patch kit](https://zdcs.link/QGrBVK?object_uuid=3e0507d0-ea16-42a3-a3a4-d837968b97b8&t=article) on hand so you can patch small holes yourself and save some money.
