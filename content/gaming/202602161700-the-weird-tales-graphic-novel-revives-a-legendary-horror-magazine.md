Dating all the way back to 1923, Weird Tales is easily one of the most iconic pulp magazines ever published. That venerable series is returning in a new form in 2026, as Monstrous Books aims to revive Weird Tales as an anthology graphic novel with some major creators attached.

IGN can exclusively debut a new cover image from The Goon creator Eric Powell. Check it out below:

Weird Tales Vol. 1 is a hardcover graphic novel that features a mix of adaptations of classic Weird Tales stories and new stories. The adapted stories include:

-   **Michael Avallone’s “The Man Who Walked on Air”** — adapted by Robert Hack and David Avallone
-   **Ray Bradbury’s “The Scythe”** — adapted by J.K. Woodward and Jonathan Maberry.
-   **Allison V. Harding’s “The Damp Man”** — adapted by Marco Finnegan and Nancy A. Collins
-   **Robert E. Howard’s “Skulls in the Stars”** — adapted by Steve Niles
-   **An original Lovecraft Mythos Story** by Rodney Barnes with art by Lukas Ketner
-   **C.L. Moore’s “Shambleau”** — adapted by George Quadros and Blake Northcott
-   **Anthony M. Rud’s “Ooze”** — reimagined by Weird Tales president, director, and producer John Harlacher and Zac Atkinson

The original stories in this book include:

-   **“Doctor Satan vs. Jules de Grandin”** by James Aquilone and Dave Swartz
-   **“The Cthulhu Project”** by Richard Krepit and EV Cantada

“For the first time, the weird, the dark, and the wondrous stories that launched the careers of genre legends leap from the pages of the magazine into a stunning graphic novel experience,” said Aquilone in a statement. “Editor Jonathan Maberry and President John Harlacher have been doing exciting things since they resurrected Weird Tales in 2019. When it came time to assemble the contributors for the historic first graphic novel, we went big and bold. These stories are worthy of the great, pulp legacy of Weird Tales."

“When I was a young teen I got to know and be mentored by Ray Bradbury,” said Weird Tales Editor Jonathan Maberry. “His extraordinary kindness was matched by deep insights into the art and science of storytelling, and that has influenced every part of life and career. He would be delighted that I’m now the editor of Weird Tales Magazine, which he both loved and was published in early in his career. Adapting his powerful and empathetic story, 'Scythe' (Weird Tales, July 1943) is a joyful honor and I can’t help but think Ray would be delighted.”

The [Kickstarter campaign for Weird Tales Vol. 1](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/manbomb/weird-tales-graphic-novel?ref=6ad245) is live now. The campaign includes various bonus tiers that include exclusive cover art, a Weird Tales challenge coin, T-shirts, and more.
