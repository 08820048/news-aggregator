New With 90-Day Warranty

### Alienware 16 Area-51 Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX RTX 5070 Ti Gaming Laptop (32GB/1TB)

This configuration is equipped with a 16" 2560x1600 240Hz G-Sync+ IPS display, Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU, GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 12GB mobile GPU, 32GB of DDR5-6400MHz RAM, and a 1TB SSD. Connectivity include three USB Type-A 3.2 ports, two Thunderbolt ports, HDMI 2.1 port, and WiFi 7. The RJ45 port is absent (you'll need a USB to ethernet adapter).

### The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti mobile GPU can handle the most demanding games

The RTX 5070 Ti mobile GPU performs about 15%-20% better than the RTX 5070. Compared to the previous generation, it's comparable in performance to the RTX 4080 and pulls ahead of it in games that support [DLSS 4.5](https://www.ign.com/articles/dlss-4-explained-everything-you-need-to-know-about-nvidias-latest-ai-upscaling-tech) and multi-frame generation. It's powerful enough to run just about any game on the display's upgraded 2560x1600 resolution.

### The Area-51: new color, curvy design, metal construction, and upgraded cooling

The Alienware Area-51 is a considerable upgrade compared to the previous generation's Alienware m16. For starters, both the lid and chassis are clad in anodized aluminum with a unique iridescent finish. The frame is made of a durable and lightweight magnesium alloy. Cooling has been upgraded with generous amounts of copper and a new thermal interface. Dell claims that it can handle up to 240W TDP without raising acoustics.

Design-wise, the Area 51 has a sleeker, more contoured shape compared to previous models, with rounded edges and soft corners replacing the traditional squared off design. The hinges are internally positioned so that they're near invisible. A transparent window on the undercarriage shows off the internal components. There's also plenty of RGB illumination, although most of it can be turned off if you don't like that sort of thing.
