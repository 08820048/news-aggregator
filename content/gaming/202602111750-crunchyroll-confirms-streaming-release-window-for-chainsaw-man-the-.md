Crunchyroll has revealed that Chainsaw Man - The Movie: Reze Arc will arrive on the anime streaming service this spring. In the [announcement](https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/announcements/2026/2/10/chainsaw-man-the-movie-reze-arc-stream-spring-2026), Crunchyroll notes that the streaming release will be accompanied by “a range of subs and subs,” but does not confirm specific languages.

While not exactly a concrete release date, the streaming window is relatively soon, offering a boon to fans who didn’t catch one of last year’s biggest anime movies in theaters.

The Chainsaw Man movie was originally released in Japan last September, where it quickly climbed and proceeded to hold on to the #1 spot at the box office for [over a full month](https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/latest/2025/10/21/chainsaw-man-the-movie-reze-arc-number-1-5th-weekend-japan-box-office?srsltid=AfmBOoo3z47TRuTJQ0bU2dEr-pnEfYMzEnSYItArE-9XZfV71VeFuCAM). The movie's popularity continued to grow after expanding to North American theaters in mid-October, leading to a global box office haul of [over $162 million](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl3728441345/).

This success is one of many that contributed to a record-breaking year at the Japanese box office; according to [The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/japan-box-office-record-2025-demon-slayer-kokuho-1236488236/), theaters saw a 32% increase in revenue over the course of the year. Another notable release contributing to the box office excitement was Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle, which, as of early 2026, is the [highest grossing Japanese movie of all time](https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/weekend-box-office-demon-slayer-infinity-castle-highest-grossing-japanese-film/) (and a [Golden Globes nominee](https://www.ign.com/articles/2026-golden-globes-nominations-revealed-check-out-the-full-list)).

In the world of anime movies, this is a relatively quick turnaround for a streaming release, likely a product of the film’s theatrical success. The Chainsaw Man movie also ended up being Letterboxd’s [highest user-rated film of 2025](https://letterboxd.com/official/list/2025-highest-rated-films/), with [IGN’s own review](https://www.ign.com/articles/chainsaw-man-the-movie-reze-arc-review) highlighting plenty of action as well as "a compelling and hauntingly beautiful romance."

For now, Chainsaw Man -The Movie: Reze Arc is only available to purchase digitally through services [like Prime Video](https://zdcs.link/9227AW?object_uuid=e12d5502-1b0a-4bd9-92c6-200fff2855b0&t=article). Crunchyroll, which [recently increased prices](https://www.ign.com/articles/crunchyroll-is-increasing-prices-right-after-removing-its-free-streaming-plan) and removed free streaming support, asked fans to “stay tuned for more details for an exact release date, time and languages.” No information has been revealed about a physical release, but it would be reasonable to anticipate one under the Crunchyroll banner.

The first and only Chainsaw Man movie so far is a direct sequel to the anime’s first season, which we gave a [solid 9/10](https://www.ign.com/articles/chainsaw-man-season-1-review). Season 2 is currently in development, and is expected to pick up right after the movie's conclusion with the Assassin’s Arc from Tatsuki Fujimoto’s original manga. No release window has been announced.
