Anchor Point Studios has spun out from its parent company, NetEase.

[NetEase announced the launch of Anchor Point Studios back in 2023](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/netease-announces-development-outfit-anchor-point-studios). Headed by veteran Paul Ehreth – previously director at Smilegate Barcelona and lead designer at Remedy working on Alan Wake 2 and Control – the studio is based in Barcelona (Spain) with an additional office in Seattle (US). It specializes in action-adventure titles for both console and PC.

Now, however, Ehreth has confirmed an "important milestone" for the studio, and revealed it would be "transitioning to operate as an independent studio."

"This is a significant change for us, but one that we’re approaching with optimism, clarity, and excitement for what’s ahead," Ehreth wrote on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/paule_today-im-sharing-an-important-milestone-share-7427905313787346944-iClh/) (thanks, [Game Developer](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/yet-another-internal-netease-studio-is-going-independent)).

"Now, as an independent studio, we have the opportunity to focus our vision even more sharply and pursue new partnerships that align with our creative ambitions. Our team remains motivated and deeply committed to the incredible game we’re building. The passion that brought us together is stronger than ever."

The studio is now opening up "conversations with prospective investors and partners who share our vision for the future of this project and the passionate team behind it."

Ehreth closed by noting his "sincere gratitude" to NetEase "for the support, resources, and trust they’ve given us."

"Their backing allowed us to build a world‑class team, explore bold creative ideas, and lay the foundation for something truly special. We're proud of everything we’ve accomplished together," he said.

It's the latest in a growing line of Western studios that NetEase has either spun out or shuttered completely, including [Bad Brain Game Studios](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/netease-shuts-down-subsidiary-bad-brain-game-studios), [NetEase Montreal](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/qa-staff-report-layoffs-at-netease-games-montreal), [T-Minus Zero](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-netease-studio-t-minus-zero-entertainment-rescued-by-small-group-of-veteran-directors-and-founders), and [Fantastic Pixel Castle](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/netease-divests-fantastic-pixel-castle-as-studio-hunts-for-new-publisher-to-avoid-closure). It also [recently sold mobile studio Mattel163 to Mattel](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/mattel-to-acquire-full-ownership-of-mattel163-from-netease).

[NetEase has published its financial results for 2025, reporting a 6.9% rise in overall revenue to RMB 112.6 billion ($16.1 billion)](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/netease-revenue-grows-69-to-161bn-in-2025). Revenue for its gaming segment reached RMB 92.1 billion ($13.2 billion), up 10.1% from RMB 83.6 billion ($12.1 billion) in 2024.

Online games made up 97.3% of the segment's revenue for the year, driven by higher net sales from Fantasy Westward Journey Online, Identity V, Where Winds Meet, and Marvel Rivals.
