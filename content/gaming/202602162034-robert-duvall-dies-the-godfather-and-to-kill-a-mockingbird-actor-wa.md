Legendary film and TV star Robert Duvall has died at 95.

The actor’s wife, Luciana Duvall, confirmed the news with [a post](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1Cyxqqq67Q/) on his official Facebook account. She states he passed “peacefully at home, surrounded by love and comfort” yesterday, February 15.

Duvall has remained one of the most recognizable faces in Hollywood since the ‘60s. One of his earliest, most memorable roles was Boo Radley in the beloved 1962 film adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird. The years that followed saw him appear in television shows like The Untouchables, The Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits, The Fugitive, and many more. It wasn’t until the ‘70s that he became a more familiar name amongst the average movie fan, with movies like M\*A\*S\*H and The Godfather.

In addition to showing up for The Godfather Part 2, Duvall has starred in classic films like Tender Mercies, Network, Apocalypse Now, and The Apostle. He also starred opposite Tommy Lee Jones in the acclaimed miniseries Lonesome Dove. More recently, movie fans could have caught him in projects like 2009’s Crazy Heart, 2018’s Widows, or 2022’s Hustle. With a Best Actor Oscar win for his role in Tender Mercies, as well as directing and producing credits on a number of movies through the decades, his impact on entertainment is difficult to overstate.

“To the world, he was an Academy Award-winning actor, a director, a storyteller,” Luciana Duvall said in her message. “To me, he was simply everything. His passion for his craft was matched only by his deep love for characters, a great meal, and holding court. For each of his many roles, Bob gave everything to his characters and to the truth of the human spirit they represented. In doing so, he leaves something lasting and unforgettable to us all. Thank you for the years of support you showed Bob and for giving us this time and privacy to celebrate the memories he leaves behind.”

No formal service will be held following Duvall’s passing, according to a statement sent by his representative (via [ABC](https://abc30.com/post/academy-award-winning-actor-robert-duvall-dies-age-95/18608395/)). The actor’s family has a request for those who wish to honor his memory.

“Instead, the family encourages those who wish to honor his memory to do so in a way that reflects the life he lived by watching a great film, telling a good story around a table with friends, or taking a drive in the countryside to appreciate the world's beauty,” the statement adds.
