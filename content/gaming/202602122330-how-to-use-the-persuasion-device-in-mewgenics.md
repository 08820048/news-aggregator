The [_Mewgenics_](https://www.polygon.com/game/mew-genics/3325/) **Persuasion Device** is the first item given to you by Dr. Beanies, once you donate a cat to him with a mutation, birth defect, disorder, or parasite. Alongside the device, he also gives you a side quest to complete, in order to earn a reward.

If you're wondering exactly how to use the Persuasion Device in _Mewgenics_, how to complete the quest, and what the rewards are, we're here to help.

## What is the Persuasion Device in Mewgenics?

The **Persuasion Device** is classed as a weapon in _Mewgenics_, and using it will **permanently charm a non-boss enemy**, causing it to join your party. However, **the cat wielding the weapon will lose two points of speed**, and the device can only be used on enemies in an adjacent tile.

Like all allies that aren't in your immediate party of cats, the enemy you charm will be AI-controlled, and it will leave your party if it's downed upon completion of a battle. The Persuasion Device can also only be used once per battle.

## How to complete the Persuasion Device side quest

Completing the side quest simply involves beating the final boss in the area instructed to you by Dr. Beanies with the Persuasion Device in your inventory, then talking to the doc afterward. You do not need to use the item during the run, although we would recommend it because it's an incredibly powerful tool, as _Mewgenics_ can often be about strength in numbers.

This location is random in every playthrough though, so whereas for me and one of my colleagues at Polygon, we only had to take it to the end of the Caves (an easier task, since it's one of the first areas you'll unlock), another colleague was told to take it to the end of the Boneyard, which is a tougher area in the first act. You may be given one of the same areas, or you may need to take it somewhere different.

When complete, you'll be given the item to keep permanently… or as long as you can hold onto it for anyway, as if the cat holding it dies, you'll lose it again. (As of writing this, we're not sure if you can get another one from Dr. Beanies or not, so only take it with you if you're prepared to potentially lose it!) You'll also receive 250 coins for your trouble.
