Development of Borderlands 4 on Nintendo Switch 2 has been paused, Take-Two Interactive has confirmed.

Speaking to [Variety](https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/borderlands-4-switch-release-paused-take-two-ceo-gta-online-1236651227/), a spokesperson for Take-Two said it had made the "difficult decision to pause development" on the Switch 2 port, but did not clarify why.

"Our focus continues to be delivering quality post-launch content for players on the ongoing improvements to optimise the game," they said.

"We're continuing to collaborate closely with our friends at Nintendo. We have PGA Tour 2K25 coming out and WWE 2K26 \[for Switch 2\], and we're incredibly excited about bringing more of our titles to the platform in the future."

The Switch 2 port of Borderlands 4 was initially slated for launch on October 3, 2025, but [was indefinitely delayed by Gearbox](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/borderlands-4-switch-2-port-delayed-due-to-need-for-additional-development-and-polish-time) for "additional development and polish time."

In [Take-Two's latest financials](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nba-2k-and-grand-theft-auto-franchises-boost-take-two-q3-net-revenue-by-25-to-17bn), Borderlands 4 for Switch 2 had been removed from its release schedule, having previously been listed as 'TBA'.

For its third quarter, Take-Two reported a boost in revenue led by its NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto franchises. Net revenue increased by 25% to $1.7 billion, while net bookings rose by 28% to $1.76 billion.

"Our outstanding third quarter results reflect outperformance from all of our labels, and we are once again raising our net bookings outlook for fiscal 2026," said Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick.

"With ongoing momentum across many of our businesses, and the highly anticipated launch of Grand Theft Auto 6 on November 19, 2026, we continue to project record levels of net bookings in fiscal 2027, which we believe will establish a new financial baseline for our business, set us on a path to enhanced profitability, and provide further balance sheet strength and flexibility."

_GamesIndustry.biz_ also [spoke with Zelnick about the results](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-ceo-says-generative-ai-tools-are-driving-costs-and-time-efficiencies-but-that-its-worlds-are-handcrafted), in which he highlighted the post-release support of Borderlands 4.

"We're still supporting Borderlands," he said. "We'll have new content coming, we have updates coming and we are still very optimistic about that title. We think we'll continue to have strong sell-through of titles like that."
