Sony is reportedly making another Venom movie. This time, it’s going to be animated. How closely the surprise animated project will stick to the events of the recent trilogy starring [Tom Hardy](https://www.ign.com/articles/venom-star-tom-hardy-reveals-his-body-is-toast-after-years-of-intense-action-sequences-its-all-falling-to-bits-now-and-its-not-going-to-get-better), with its plot, casting details, and release date still a mystery for now.

Though the latest Lethal Protector story is still in its early stages, according to the [The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/venom-animated-movie-in-the-works-1236510453/), it does have some notable names already attached behind the scenes. [Final Destination: Bloodlines](https://www.ign.com/movies/final-destination-bloodlines) duo Zach Lipovsky and Adam B. Stein are set to direct the feature-length animation. The two are newcomers to the Marvel world but saw success with last year’s Final Destination reboot. Other highlights from their joint resume includes the 2019 live-action Kim Possible movie, 2018’s Freaks, and a few episodes of Mech-X4.

The Venom animation is said to have series veterans Amy Pascal, Avi Arad, and Matt Tolmach in the mix, though the extent of their involvement is unclear. While Hardy is also involved in the project, there’s no word on whether he will reprise his role as Eddie Brock after concluding the live-action trilogy as the character in [Venom: The Last Dance](https://www.ign.com/movies/venom-the-last-dance). No specific writer has been named to pen the film’s script as Sony Pictures Animation gets the ball rolling on its story.

Although it seems possible the animated Venom movie could go a completely new direction with its story and characters, it does have some room to grow should Sony choose to directly build on its live-action trilogy. One major Marvel character the Hardy trilogy only lightly touched on is the symbiote god Knull, with one of [The Last Dance's final credits sequences teasing big things](https://www.ign.com/articles/venom-the-last-dance-3-post-credits-scene-ending-explained) in store for that character. The series also notoriously refrained from including much about Spider-Man despite Venom’s strong ties to him (largely due to [confusing licensing arrangements](https://screenrant.com/venom-carnage-movie-rights-explained-marvel-return/)), but it’s unclear if traveling to the realm of animation would have the two finally crossing paths.

With so many pieces still coming together, it will likely be a while before we learn more, and it will be even longer before the movie actually premieres.
