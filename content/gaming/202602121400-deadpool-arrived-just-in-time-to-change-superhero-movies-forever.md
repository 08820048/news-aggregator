Had it been released a few years earlier or a few years later, it’s doubtful that we would have gotten the same film

When the returns started coming in for [_Deadpool_](https://www.polygon.com/karan-soni-deadpool-cab-driver-interview/) on its opening weekend of Feb. 12, 2016, producer Simon Kinberg thought there had been a mistake. “When the movie came on tracking, we thought it was a clerical error, then we realized that it wasn’t an error, but it was opening like a real superhero movie,” Kinberg told [Deadline](https://deadline.com/2017/03/simon-kinberg-logan-interview-deadpool-gambit-1202038420/) in 2017. “Heading into the weekend, we hoped that it would open to $70M-$80M, but then it opened to $132M-plus.”

Altogether, [_Deadpool_](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2588706305/) pulled in $782 million, made even more spectacular by the fact that 20th Century Fox had only spent $58 million on the film. The stunning haul defied the conventional wisdom Hollywood had followed for years: that an R-rated superhero movie would have limited appeal. Instead, _Deadpool_ was a massive success and it signaled near-immediate change in the business of superhero movies. Fox [announced a sequel](https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/14/deadpool-2-announced-with-tim-miller-returning-to-direct) just a couple of months later, and _Logan_, already in production, was quickly [confirmed to be R-rated](https://collider.com/wolverine-3-villains/). The ramifications of _Deadpool_’s surprise success can still be felt today: [_Deadpool & Wolverine_](https://www.polygon.com/bye-bye-bye-the-making-of-deadpool-wolverines-opening-dance-number/) (also R-Rated) was the second biggest movie of 2024 with a $1.3 billion box office return.

The credit for _Deadpool_’s success, of course, belongs with its star Ryan Reynolds, director Tim Miller, plus writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. That said, _Deadpool_ also benefitted from being released at just the right time. Had it come out a few years earlier or a few years later, it might have been a very different movie without the same impact.

By the time _Deadpool_ came out in 2016, there had been a full decade and a half of modern superhero movies, an era which began in 2000 with the first _X-Men_ film. While, yes, the Blade trilogy, which was also R-rated, kicked off two years earlier in 1998, even the top-grossing film of that franchise (_Blade II_) only pulled in $155 million at the box office, which is considerably smaller than the near $300 million _X-Men_ made. If anything, _Blade_’s financial ceiling may have helped inform the conventional wisdom that, to be a major success, a comic book film had to be PG-13.

Anyway, 2000’s _X-Men_ kicked off a new era of superhero blockbusters that was only reinforced by the success of _Spider-Man_ in 2002, X2: _X-Men United_ in 2003 and _Spider-Man 2_ in 2004. The genre reached even bigger heights in 2008 when DC released _The Dark Knight_, which redefined the artform by being more of a crime thriller than a typical superhero film (proof that the superhero mold _can_ be successfully broken). That same year, Marvel launched its cinematic universe with _Iron Man_, and over the next few years the MCU illustrated that you could tell a coherent, connected story across several different films with different heroes, which culminated in the $1.5 billion success of 2012’s _Avengers_.

    ![The Avengers (2012) screencap](https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16124832/The_Avengers_2012_steve_and_tony_34894576_1920_1080.jpg?q=70&fit=crop&w=1300&dpr=1)Image: Marvel Studios

Yet all was not perfect in the genre during this period. While the MCU made few major errors before _Deadpool_’s release, other studios weren’t so successful. DC struggled with 2011’s _Green Lantern_, and Sony’s _Spider-Man 3_, while profitable, drew scorn from [fans](https://forums.superherohype.com/threads/the-i-hated-spider-man-3-thread.271897/) and [critics](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/spider-man-3-2007) alike for being overstuffed with too much plot and too many villains.

The bloom was especially off the rose over at Fox. After the success of X2: _X-Men United_, the third film failed to capture the same levels of excitement and maturity. Fox’s various _Daredevil_ and _Fantastic Four_ movies failed to be major hits. And, most directly related to _Deadpool_, 2009’s _X-Men Origins: Wolverine_ [downright infuriated fans](https://geeksofdoom.com/2009/05/03/movie-review-x-men-origins-wolverine) for how it mishandled so many characters from the X-Men franchise. The movie was so bad Fox basically decided to scrap its X-Men universe and relaunch it with 2011’s _First Class_.

_X-Men Origins: Wolverine_ did no character dirtier than Deadpool. The quippy “Merc with a Mouth” — as the comic books called him — was literally rendered mouthless. He was also given all kinds of weird powers and made to look nothing like his comic book counterpart. The _only_ thing the movie did right by Deadpool was cast Reynolds, who not only was perfect for the part in his ability to handle the action and comedy of the character, but became Deadpool’s biggest advocate for the character’s own starring vehicle.

To Fox’s credit, the company was open-minded enough to a Deadpool movie to film test footage for it in 2012, but ultimately shelved the project. Two years later, [in July 2014](https://filmstories.co.uk/news/deadpool-how-two-minutes-of-leaked-footage-wound-up-changing-the-marvel-cinematic-universe-forever/), Reynolds famously leaked the footage — [something he finally admitted to in 2025](https://ew.com/ryan-reynolds-finally-admits-leaking-deadpool-test-footage-11804700) — which was met with a tremendously positive response from fans. A few months later, in September 2014, Fox officially announced [a _Deadpool_ movie](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/fox-announces-deadpool-movie-2016/).

When _Deadpool_ came out in 2016, it was informed by a decade and a half of comic book movies, both successes and failures alike. With the failures, it’s pretty clear how that went into _Deadpool_. Everyone involved in making the film was happy to poke fun at other comic book movies, _especially_ ones that featured Reynolds. Thanks to the character’s fourth-wall breaking powers, Deadpool himself was able to crack jokes about the actor’s performances in both _X-Men Origins: Wolverine_ and 2011’s _Green Lantern_.

Reynolds and co. were also happy to hit Fox where it _really_ hurt by pointing out just how convoluted its X-Men movies had become. In one memorable moment, Colossus (Stefan Kapičić) shows up and threatens to bring Deadpool to Professor X. Deadpool replies: “McAvoy or Stewart? These timelines are so confusing!”

But while Deadpool's lampooning of comic book movies gave the film a unique voice, the storytelling of _Deadpool_ was far more conventional. On a budget of just $58 million, the filmmakers were forced to play it safe, with a relatively simplistic villain in Ajax (Ed Skrein), who was chosen _specifically_ because he helped tell Deadpool’s origin story. It was a formula Marvel had found success with in _Iron Man_, _Thor_ and _Captain America: The First Avenger_. The MCU had a clear, almost cookie-cutter formula for establishing a hero, and while _Deadpool_ was a Fox film, it very much stuck to Marvel’s playbook.

Had the movie come out a few years earlier, like, say, a year after the test footage was filmed in 2012, it’s possible Marvel’s formula could have played less of a part, since the studio was still proving itself in the lead-up to _Avengers_. By 2016, not only had the MCU paved the way forward, but a number of bad comic book movies released to capitalize on Marvel’s success meant audiences were ready for Deadpool to take a dump on the genre.

On the other end, it’s pretty clear why _Deadpool_ might not have happened much later than 2016: Disney.

Disney bought Fox in 2019 and proceeded to take its sweet time reintroducing the characters Fox controlled into the greater MCU. We _finally_ got [a Fantastic Four movie in 2025](https://www.polygon.com/marvel/536475/fantastic-four-movie-plot-inspired-comics), and the MCU’s first proper X-Men film likely isn’t coming until [2028](https://www.superherohype.com/movies/649177-mcu-x-men-movie-release-date-window-reportedly-revealed). Had Deadpool not already had two successful movies under his belt when Disney bought Fox, it’s hard to imagine the House of Mouse would have agreed to subvert the X-Men with Deadpool before even establishing them. At the earliest, Disney likely would have waited until the 2030s to get to an obscure X-Men character like Deadpool, and by that time it's unlikely the company would have cast a 50-something Ryan Reynolds.

Aside from the simple question of timing, it’s also really hard to imagine Disney being the first studio to greenlight a major R-rated superhero movie (complete with a notorious pegging joke). Yes, Disney was willing to _follow_ this already-established R-rated formula for a _third_ Deadpool movie, but I sincerely doubt they’d break the mold to begin with — something Fox only did because it had failed so much in the years leading up to _Deadpool_ that it was finally willing to take a (measured) risk. Even now, after the MCU has had numerous failures post-_Avengers: Endgame_, Disney still seems reluctant to break its once reliable formula.

No, to get the Deadpool movie we got — and the ones we’re [continuing to get](https://movieweb.com/ryan-reynolds-developing-deadpool-4-mcu-sequel/) — it _had_ to be Fox and it _had_ to be Ryan Reynolds and it _had_ to be 2016. Otherwise, there'd be no Deadpool horny for Colossus, no Deadpool’s pantless baby legs, and certainly no Morena Baccarin pegging Deadpool.
