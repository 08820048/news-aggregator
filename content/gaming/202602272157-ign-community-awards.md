As IGN Fan Fest 2026 comes to a close, and we celebrate our favorite franchises across gaming and entertainment, it felt like a great time to celebrate you, our users. As some of you may have noticed last December, we didn’t recognize our top contributors to the site as we have in years past. Well, fear not, because that time is now here.

Each year, we adjust the criteria required for users that contributed positively to the community to be considered in the ranking of our top users. This year, we made our biggest adjustments yet. We are continuously working to remove the most problematic users from the community in an effort to better it, so one of the major components this year was ban history.

We’ve also introduced a new classification of Top User we've dubbed **IGN All Stars**, which comes with some new rewards. Please give a warm round of congratulations to our 3 IGN All Stars and rest of the top 10 users and their stats from 2025:

All users will each receive a year of IGN Plus, and our 3 IGN All Stars will also receive Humble Choice as a small gesture of gratitude from me and everyone at IGN and Humble Bundle.

In addition to recognizing these users who uplifted our community, we have also removed over 400 users who consistently violated our community guidelines. These banned accounts are those who have engaged in hate speech, harassment, or other toxic behaviors. These actions are necessary for our commitment to creating a safe and welcoming space for everyone at IGN. Thank you again to those exemplifying the best attitudes and behavior and serving as a role model for other users on the site. We look forward to another great year of your participation and hope to see others join the top ranks in 2026.

We have more updates coming for you very soon!
