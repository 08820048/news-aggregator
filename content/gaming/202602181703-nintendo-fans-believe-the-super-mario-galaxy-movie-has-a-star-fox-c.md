Nintendo fans believe a new trailer for [The Super Mario Galaxy Movie](https://www.ign.com/movies/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie) may be teasing a cameo from none other than Star Fox leader Fox McCloud.

While fans have long pined for a Nintendo cinematic universe and even a Super Smash Bros. movie, theories really caught fire yesterday after the Super Mario Bros. company published a new video (below) for its upcoming film. It’s an unassuming, 30-second clip almost entirely composed of previously released footage, but it only took a fresh look at a few suspicious frames for viewers to expect some truly wild reveals when the film premieres in April.

The blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moment happens at the two-second mark and can be seen on the far-left side of the screen. If you pause just as thousands of others have, you’ll see what is believed to be a body wearing a green shirt, a white vest, and a familiar blaster. Yes, fans suspect this brief glimpse at an unidentified figure is our first look at Fox in The Super Mario Galaxy Movie.

Whether or not it’s actually the star of Nintendo’s classic Star Fox series is impossible to say for now. Points in favor of believers include the metal pistol shape, as well as [The Super Mario Bros. Movie](https://www.ign.com/movies/the-super-mario-bros-movie) sequel’s sci-fi setting. With Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, and more all set to travel through space, an Arwing (or maybe even a few) could certainly help them get around.

However, Nintendo mostly stuck to the Mario world for its first film and has shown no sign of tying in the Star Fox universe or any of its other many video game properties. As many naysayers online have also suggested, this tiny tease could simply be a cropped look at someone like Bowser Jr., a vehicle, such as [Luigi’s motorcycle](https://x.com/CamTheCan/status/2023985414894240225?s=20), or even [Toad's backpack](https://x.com/Justin_Hsieh7/status/2024109469639303423?s=20). Still, the evidence pointing away from a Fox McCloud cameo isn’t stopping die-hard fans from looking for any signs of a Super Smash Bros. crossover movie.

We’ll likely have to wait for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie to reach its April 1 release date before we find out if the Star Fox team will actually show up to help Mario. In the meantime, you can see [how a recently revealed toy set may have leaked the inclusion of another classic Nintendo character](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-looks-set-to-feature-a-classic-nes-character).
