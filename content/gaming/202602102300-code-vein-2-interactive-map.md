Find your way in the past or in the present

The **_Code Vein 2_** **map** is one of the game's key features, and follows a design similar to _Elden Ring_. There are landmarks to draw your attention, tall buildings that hide dungeon entrances, and old facilities that contain precious, long-forgotten treasures.

Whether you are exploring the map in the past or in the present day when the protagonists wake up, navigating it can be quite confusing. In addition to the maze-like corridors, the verticality of most locations can make you feel disoriented. The design of _Code Vein 2_'s map makes searching for important items or enemies a challenge in itself, but there are multiple valuable things to search for.

**Map Jammers** are small purple trees that you should seek out and destroy to clear the map and have a better sense of the area. Next, **Golden blood beads** and **golden nectars** are important materials required to upgrade your character's healing items. Once ready, you can start looking for new **blood codes** and **unique weapons** to make your character stronger.

Scattered across the map are special vendors called **Jadwiga's Minions**, who may have upgrade materials and strong formae to equip your weapons. You can also find these by opening treasure chests. Most of these are well hidden, but occasionally you will find a chest waiting for you in plain sight.

If you want to track these and many other items, you can check our **_Code Vein 2_** **interactive map** below.
