GDC's [full agenda is now available](https://schedule.gdconf.com/).

The event, taking place from March 9-13 in San Francisco, California, will welcome 1000+ speakers and 700+ sessions across the five-day "festival," including presentations from Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 developer Sandfall Interactive, Dispatch's AdHoc Studio, and Kojima Production's Hideo Kojima.

Kojima's presentation is set for March 12 for Festival and Game Changer Pass holders and is titled, Restarting from zero: A message to creators considering independence. KJP's Iildar Valeev will also explore how the team made Death Stranding 2's Voxel 3D UI map.

Sandfall will present several times across the event, including an "audio postmortem" of its record-breaking debut title, an Adobe workshop on Substance 3D texturing, a live podcast about how the studio scaled up its project, a talk on how to deliver "a wide scope of features and content when you only have four programmers," and a Q&A for new writers and narrative designers.

Dispatch developer AdHoc Studio will present an hour long discussion about how to turn a "dead genre into a breakout hit."

Earlier today, [GDC organisers Informa said they have not seen any drop in planned attendance by overseas visitors](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gdc-organiser-says-it-hasnt-seen-cancellations-from-overseas-visitors-attendance-tracking-in-line-with-expectations), despite escalating industry concern over both costs and the current US political situation. The show's controversial decision to rebrand from Game Developer Conference to GDC Festival of Gaming also received a [lukewarm response](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gdc-festival-of-gaming-the-industry-reacts-to-the-controversial-rebrand).
