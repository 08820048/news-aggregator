We see you, we love you

## Valentine's Day for dorks like us

Love is love. Awkward, impassioned, pixelated, tabletop, long-distance, gloriously single, whatever flavor. Do it your way on Valentine's Day. Ship who you ship. Watch or play something that makes you happy. Romance your co-op partner. Romance yourself. Romance no one and counterprogram to show the world no one gets to tell you who or how to love, or what 24-hour period to love in. We’re not judging. We’re celebrating. And we'll take any excuse to write about embarrassingly sincere feelings, including the weird love connections in films, TV, and games that make us happy. Who knows, there might even be some smooching.

    And yet I cannot stop thinking about Lucy's relationship with The Ghoul (Walton Goggins).
    
    The mismatched duo spends most of Season 2 together, but their uneasy alliance can only go so far. In episode 5, "The Wrangler," The Ghoul agrees to take Lucy back to the Vault as part of a deal with her father, Hank (Kyle MacLachlan). Lucy, understandably, is shocked and hurt — she was under the impression they were tracking down her scheming father together.
