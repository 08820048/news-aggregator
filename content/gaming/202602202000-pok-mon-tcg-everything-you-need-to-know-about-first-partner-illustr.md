### Pokémon TCG: Pokémon Day 2026 Collection

## **What’s Inside the Box?**

The International version is designed as a celebration of the bonds between Trainers and their First Partner. Each collection includes 1 Promo Booster Pack, where you can pull three of nine illustration rare-style promo cards.

Each of these cards feature stunning illustrations of beloved first partner Pokémon. You’ve got your classic Kanto friends - Bulbasaur, Squirtle, Charmander. Then, we jump forward a few generations to Sinnoh, with Turtwig, Pipulp and Chimchar. Last, but certainly not least, we find ourselves in Alola with Rowlet, Popplio and Litten.

You’ll also get two booster packs, likely to be from recent Scarlet & Violet expansions like Ascended Heroes or Perfect Order. Perhaps best of all - a fun sticker sheet featuring First Partner Pokémon friends! I know that’s why you’re really after these sets.

If you, like me, want to catch 'em all, you might be interested in checking out the special feature of the Chinese collection - an acrylic, connectable magnetic display frame to showcase the cards and connect with future volumes. Perfect if you want to have your collection on display!

## **Expected Chase Cards**

All cards in Series 1 feature stunning nostalgic artwork by fan-favorite artist Saboteri, the mind behind Mega Froslass ex from Ascended Heroes and Phanpy from Surging Sparks. Each card includes "Easter egg" background details like regional Gym Badges, Z-Crystals and Poké Tech from their respective region. Neat!

Because these Special Illustration Rare (SIR) style promos are exclusive to these boxes, this will be your only chance to get this piece of 30th Anniversary history. High-priority for anyone looking to complete a 30th Anniversary master set, or collect all cards of their favourite first partner Pokémon.

## **When Will Series 2 and 3 Drop?**

Considering this collection is branded as "Series 1", it’s likely we’ll see the rest of the First Partner Pokémon in an unannounced Series 2 and 3. We can look at the [current 2026 release calendar](https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-full-release-schedule-2026) to predict when they might launch.

Given that Series 1 launches in March, exactly one week before Perfect Order, I think it's highly likely Series 2 would closely follow the next major expansion, Chaos Rising, in Summer 2026. The 1-4-7, 2-5-8, 3-6-9 pattern is a common TCG trope, so it’s likely to cover Johto (Gen 2), Unova (Gen 5), and Galar (Gen 8).

Series 3 would then drop in Fall 2026, rounding off the collection in Hoenn (Gen 3), Kalos (Gen 6), and Paldea (Gen 9).

With rumors of Generation 10 being announced on Pokemon Day (February 27), collectors are wondering if we’ll see a secret Series 4, or if the Gen 10 starters could be being teased right in front of our very eyes… If so, that could completely shift the resell value of these special 30th Anniversary collections!
