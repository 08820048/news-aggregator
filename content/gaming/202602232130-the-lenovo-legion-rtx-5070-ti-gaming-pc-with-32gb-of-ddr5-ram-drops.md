Nowadays it's quite difficult to find an RTX 5070 Ti prebuilt for under $2,000, but not impossible. Lenovo currently has a [Legion Tower 5 RTX 5070 Ti gaming PC](https://zdcs.link/aD8ZNR?object_uuid=9faeb948-3dc1-49f1-9049-32a4b0e6ba8e&t=article) for just $1,859.99 after you apply two stackable coupon codes "**EXTRAFIVE**" and "**BUYMORELENOVO**". It's paired with an Intel Core Ultra 9 processor and 32GB of DDR5 RAM.

Thinking of saving money by building your own DIY RTX 5070 Ti system? Think again. With the [rising prices of GPUs](https://www.ign.com/articles/2026-is-going-to-suck-for-pc-gaming), the RTX 5070 Ti graphics card is currently selling for at least $250 over MSRP. Other comparable options, such as the Radeon RX 9070 XT or RTX 5080, also have a steep markup.

### Lenovo Legion Tower 5 Gen 10 Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX RTX 5070 Ti Gaming PC (32GB/1TB)

Use codes: EXTRAFIVE and BUYMORELENOVO

This Lenovo Legion Tower 5 Gen 10 configuration is equipped with a liquid-cooled Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU, GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GPU, 32GB of DDR5-5600MHz RAM, and a 1TB SSD.

Something to note is that this PC is equipped with an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU on a customized Intel HM870 mATX motherboard. The 275HX is traditionally a laptop CPU, and laptop CPUs are permanently soldered onto the motherboard. That means you won't be able to swap out the CPU for a better one in the future. If you don't intend on swapping the CPU (and let's face it, most of us who buy prebuilts probably never will), then you'll get excellent performance out of this chip.

The [RTX 5070 Ti](https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-review) offers the best bang for your buck amongst the new Nvidia Blackwell cards in terms of 4K gaming performance. It performs neck-and-neck with the previous generation [RTX 4080 Super](https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-super-review) and pulls ahead in any game that supports multi-frame generation, especially with the [recent DLSS 4.5 update](https://in.ign.com/tech/251831/feature/nvidia-here-is-why-i-chose-team-green-and-how-dlss-45-and-its-2nd-gen-transformer-model-changed-my-g).
