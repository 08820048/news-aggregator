It's only been a few weeks since it [was announced](https://www.ign.com/articles/brandon-sandersons-cosmere-universe-book-adaptations-apple-tv-news) that Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere universe would be coming to Apple TV, but progress is already being made. Sanderson took to [his Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxHaq5kFbak) today after missing his usual update last week.

He mentioned a minor shoulder surgery was to blame for missing last week's update, but that it hasn't slowed down his work on the Mistborn screenplay. "I bet you're waiting to hear how the Mistborn screenplay is going, and it is at 10%. So, I have made very good progress."

Like all of his ongoing projects, you can track progress on the Mistborn screenplay [directly on his website](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/) where he has progress bars for everything he's working on right now. He last gave an update about the screenplay two weeks ago, saying [he was only 2% done](https://www.ign.com/articles/brandon-sanderson-gives-mistborn-book-adaptation-apple-tv-update), so it would seem like he is moving rather quickly.

Sanderson also addressed the cancellation of his livestream following the news breaking about the Apple TV deal, saying "I got up that day for the livestream and got texts from the publishing team that said there's like a WGA or something and I'm like, "Okay, let's not talk about me in Hollywood working on a screenplay". He had taken to [the Cosmere subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/1qps9wy/update_from_brandon/) shortly after the original announcement saying he would be doing a livestream that Friday to talk more about the upcoming adaptations, so the cancellation was a surprise for fans.

He went on to say that he's not in the WGA \[Writers Guild of America\] yet, but mentioned that he wouldn't write the screenplay if the WGA were on strike out of solidarity. He also mentioned that he does still plan on doing another livestream at some point, but didn't mention a specific date for when you should expect that.

Sanderson's progress and frequent updates about the screenplay are a welcome sight for fans worried about it affecting his other work, especially upcoming [Cosmere books](https://www.ign.com/articles/brandson-sanderson-cosmere-books-in-order). He has mentioned a couple of times that while the Mistborn screenplay and work on the Stormlight Archive series will impact his schedule, he doesn't think it will impact his plans for the books too much.
