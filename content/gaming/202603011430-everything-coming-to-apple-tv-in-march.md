A new month means a new batch of shows and movies on all of your favorite streaming services. Apple TV certainly has a shorter list of releases than something like Netflix or HBO Max, as the service itself has long claimed a "quality over quantity" approach to original programming. The bulk of new additions are full-fledged Apple TV Originals, including the return of For All Mankind. If you're already hooked on an Apple series or are looking forward to any new ones, here’s everything coming to Apple TV in March 2026.

## What’s New on Apple TV in March

### **Formula 1 2026 Season Continues**

Apple TV continues to be the streaming home for all things Formula 1, with two major events [scheduled for March](https://www.formula1.com/en/racing/2026). The Australian Grand Prix will run from March 5 to March 8, while the Chinese Grand Prix runs from March 12 to 15.

### **March 4**

-   **The Hunt (Premiere)**
-   **Hijack (Final Episode)**
-   **Drops of God S2 Episode 7**
-   **Shrinking S3 Episode 6**

The Hunt is one of the first new Apple TV series we’ll be getting in March. The French-language thriller was originally delayed from its initial 2025 release date [over plagiarism concerns](https://deadline.com/2026/02/the-hunt-premiere-date-apple-tv-plagiarism-investigation-1236728010/), which now seemed to be resolved by addressing the show as “a story based on Shoot by Douglas Fairbairn.”

Wednesdays are also when we’ll get new episodes of Drops of God, Shrinking, and, in this case, the final episode of Hijack.

### **March 6**

-   **The Last Thing He Told Me S2 Episode 3**
-   **Monarch: Legacy of Monsters S2 Episode 2**

The Last Thing He Told Me is yet another Apple series carrying over from earlier this year. Fridays are also when we’ll get new episodes of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters Season 2, which just premiered at the end of February. We already got the chance to [check out the full second season](https://www.ign.com/articles/monarch-legacy-of-monsters-season-2-review-recap-no-spoilers), with critic Tara Bennet claiming it “retains bragging rights as the Monsterverse project giving audiences the best balance of kaiju thrills and compelling storytelling.”

### **March 11**

-   **Drops of God S2 Episode 8 (Final)**
-   **Shrinking S3 Episode 7**

### **March 13**

-   **Twisted Yoga**
-   **The Last Thing He Told Me S2 Episode 4**
-   **Monarch: Legacy of Monsters S2 Episode 3**

Another premiere, Twisted Yoga is a docu-series that gives ex-members of an abusive tantric yoga studio the opportunity to tell their stories.

### **March 18**

-   **Imperfect Women (Premiere)**
-   **Shrinking Season 3 Episode 8**

Imperfect Women is yet another new psychological thriller starring Kerry Washington (Scandal) and Elisabeth Moss (The Handmaid's Tale). Created for television by Annie Weisman, the series will follow how a single crime leads to the undoing of three best friends.

### **March 20**

-   **Wonder Pets: In the City S2**
-   **The Last Thing He Told Me S2 Episode 5**
-   **Monarch: Legacy of Monsters S2 Episode 4**

If you didn’t know, Apple TV brought back the mid-2000s Nickelodeon show Wonder Pets for an ‘urban takeover’ spin-off back in 2024. The family-friendly series will kick off its second season toward the middle of the month.

### March 25

-   **Imperfect Women Episode 2**

### **March 27**

-   **For All Mankind S5 (Premiere)**
-   **The Last Thing He Told Me S2 Episode 6**
-   **Monarch: Legacy of Monsters S2 Episode 5**

One of the biggest premieres of the month is the sci-fi hit For All Mankind returning for a fifth season. We’ve been pretty big fans of this show, from our [9/10 review of the Season 1 Premiere](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/01/for-all-mankind-review-apple-tv-plus) all the way through to [the most recent season](https://www.ign.com/articles/for-all-mankind-season-4-episodes-1-7-review-apple-tv). (Though there were some hiccups along the way).

The new season jumps to 2012 with the usual mix of new and returning cast members. It’s also slated for the usual 10 episodes, concluding ahead of the premiere of the Russia-focused spin-off, [Star City](https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2026/02/apple-tv-unveils-a-first-look-at-star-city-the-gripping-new-space-race-drama-set-in-the-world-of-for-all-mankind-from-award-winning-creators-ben-nedivi-matt-wolpert-and-ronald-d-moore/), later this year.

## **Apple TV Still Offers a Free Trial**

7 Days Free

### Apple TV+ Free Trial

Apple TV is one of the more unique streaming services. It only offers [one subscription plan](https://www.ign.com/wikis/apple-tv/Plans_and_Pricing), which costs $12.99/month, and is otherwise available through one of the more reasonably priced [streaming bundles](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-streaming-bundle-packages) with [Peacock](https://www.ign.com/articles/apple-tv-and-peacock-launch-new-streaming-bundle). The most common entry point for Apple TV is the three-month trial included in most new Apple device purchases, but the streaming service also happens to offer its own seven-day free trial for new subscribers.
