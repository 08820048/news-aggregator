It's been almost a year since [Assassin's Creed Shadows](https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows) released, and Ubisoft is not done updating its feudal Japan-set stabathon. This month brings the addition of a manual jump option, alongside two other fan-requested changes.

As part of the 1.1.8 update going live today, February 17, Ubisoft will add a manual jump option to the game (if you've toggled on your Advanced Parkour setting), which returns from previous titles in the series.

Two other small additions are also set to become available: a detailed stat page so you can analyze your build in granular detail, and some visual improvements to when you make a critical hit. All of these changes had been requested by fans, so are likely to be positively received.

That said, this is a pretty small set of additions that look like the game's only major update across the first three months of this year. Update 1.1.7 launched back in December, capping off a first nine months of post-release additions that had arrived pretty much every month.

Today's update to Assassin's Creed Shadows is the first notable addition to the game of 2026, and according to a Winter Roadmap released by Ubisoft looks to be the only one coming ahead of the game's March 20 anniversary, which the company will celebrate with a livestream and giveaways. Here's hoping we hear more of what's coming to the game in its second year then.

The only other item of note before then is the Switch 2 launch of the game's Claws of Awaji expansion on March 10. The add-on caps off the game's main narrative and [now looks to be the only major expansion the game will get](https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-no-longer-plans-to-release-a-second-assassins-creed-shadows-expansion). It's hard not to compare the level of support for Shadows with that for the series' previous game Valhalla, which received three major expansions, an Odyssey crossover DLC, an epilogue DLC and several major new modes, and feel like Shadows has been underserved in comparison.

Earlier this month, a report stated that [Ubisoft had scrapped a multiplayer Assassin's Creed game that originally began as Shadows DLC](https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-reportedly-cancels-rumored-cooperative-multiplayer-assassins-creed-game). The DLC would allegedly have involved four Assassins joining forces to take on a series of scripted missions with up to four players that would have ultimately concluded the story told in the game's [now-canceled Season Pass](https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-no-longer-plans-to-release-a-second-assassins-creed-shadows-expansion).

Meanwhile, 2026 is widely-expected to be the year [Ubisoft releases its long-awaited Assassin's Creed: Black Flag remaster](https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-is-the-name-of-ubisofts-long-awaited-pirate-remake), which has leaked more times now than a very old pirate boat. As of yet, however, the project still officially remains under wraps.
