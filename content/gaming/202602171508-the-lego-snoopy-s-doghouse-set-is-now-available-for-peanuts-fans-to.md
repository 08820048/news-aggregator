Featuring Snoopy and Woodstock alongside Snoopy's classic red doghouse, this set is now available to preorder exclusively on the LEGO Store for $89.99. There's still a few months to go until it's officially released, though, so make sure to mark your calendars for June 1.

Out June 1, 2026

### LEGO Ideas Peanuts: Snoopy's Doghouse #21368

The Snoopy's Doghouse set is one that's recommended for adult builders, which makes sense given it looks much more like a display piece than a toy, and comes with 964 pieces. These bricks come together to create a posable Snoopy - complete with two alternative leg builds and two neck positions so you can pose him standing up, sitting down, or even lying down - a typewriter, the doghouse, a campfire, and a little Woodstock figure.

The inner walls of the doghouse can also be folded out to create a backdrop of the night sky for the campfire. With this setup, you can have Snoopy and Woodstock roasting some marshmallows together over the mini fire. How can you not love that?

If you're a big fan of the Peanuts, this looks like a set worth grabbing and having up on display. And even though its release date isn't until June, it's worth preordering now rather than waiting to buy it, in the event it sells out.

While June is still quite a ways away, it doesn't mean there isn't still plenty for LEGO fans to look forward to in the immediate future. March is absolutely stacked with exciting new sets already, from the adorable [Floating Sea Otters set](https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-lego-floating-sea-otters-set-21366) to the [Sauron’s Helmet](https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-lego-the-lord-of-the-rings-saurons-helmet) to the sleek [Ford Model T set](https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-lego-ford-model-t-set-11376). But you don't even have to wait until March. February's had plenty of great new drops as well, including [new Pokémon sets](https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-lego-sets-where-to-buy) releasing on February 27. What a start to the year.
