With the Visitor's entrance in [_Fortnite_](https://www.polygon.com/game/fortnite/2417/) Chapter 7 Season 1, players are now able to complete the **"Interference" story quests**.

​​

There are seven stages to complete in total, with four available right now, and it all begins by talking to The Visitor in Classified Canyon. You'll be taken across the map as you must use stealth splashes, eliminate opponents at Lethal Labs or Classified Canyon, touch a zero point shard, and more.

Here's **how to complete every stage of the Interference story quest** along with all of their rewards.

## Ask The Visitor about investigating Dark Voyager

For Stage 1, you need to interact with The Visitor who can be found just south of the Classified Canyon triangle. After you find and talk to them, make sure to complete the stage by selecting the story dialogue option, "Dark Voyager."

Once complete, you'll earn 15,000 XP and unlock the next stage.

## Travel distance while under the effect of stealth splash to outmaneuver Dark Voyager

For Stage 2, you need to find stealth splash, a throwable item that will make any player "invisible," but affected players will still have a faint outline.

Unfortunately, stealth splashes are found just like most other items in _Fortnite_ — as random loot found in chests or on the floor. Once you find one, make sure to throw it at your feet to become stealthed and travel 50 distance. You can sprint, drive a car, or even ride a hot air balloon as they'll all count.Once complete, you'll earn 15,000 XP and unlock the next stage.

## Eliminate opponents at Lethal Labs or Classified Canyon to stall Dark Voyager's work

For Stage 3, you need to eliminate three opponents at either Lethal Labs or Classified Canyon. It doesn't all have to be in the same game or at the same location, so feel free to take your time with this one.

Once complete, you'll earn 15,000 XP and unlock the next stage.

## Touch a Zero Point Shard to investigate its mysterious effects

For Stage 4, head over to the center of Lethal Labs to find the Zero Point Shards, which are the large pieces of floating debris. Now, as the Zero Point Shards are floating, they're a bit out of reach of your jumps. There are a few ways to touch the Zero Point Shard. The easiest way is to glide into it after you drop from the Battle Bus. Other methods include launching yourself with a shockwave grenade, flying in with a wingsuit, or gliding off of a launch pad.

Once complete, you'll earn 15,000 XP, but you'll need to wait for the next stage on Thursday, Feb. 26. Once the new story quests have been released, we'll update this guide with more information.
