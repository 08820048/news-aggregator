In case you missed it, PlayStation’s Direct store is offering [major discounts on first-party PlayStation titles](https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-launches-a-brand-new-promotional-sale-on-ps5-games-accessories-and-more), even offering PS5 games at less than third-party retailers.

One of the best deals we’ve spotted is Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, with Insomniac Games’ 2023 adventure seeing a 57% discount from its usual price - [bringing it to $29.99](https://zdcs.link/9l8wex?object_uuid=99f2e593-f614-498d-9796-f61ad3ed79f3&t=article).

### Marvel's Spider-Man 2

## Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 Is Better Than Half Price Right Now

The jury is out on whether Spider-Man 2 is better than its tighter, more personal predecessor or the even more focused standalone Miles Morales chapter, but it’s a fantastic showcase of the power of the PS5 as players switch between two Spider-Men almost instantly while exploring the city and coming face-to-face with the likes of Kraven, The Hunter.

[In our review](https://www.ign.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-review), Simon Cardy awarded Marvel’s Spider-Man an 8 out of 10, saying, “Its story of two Spider-Men is a great time and a Spidey fan’s dream to play through as comic book pages are brought to life, elegantly walking the tightrope between light humour and heavier themes.”

“Meanwhile, Insomniac refines a successful formula of combat and web-swinging without revolutionising either in major ways, making them comfy and familiar with just enough new tweaks and abilities to elevate them to fun new heights.”

Don’t forget, 2026 will see Insomniac suit up again, but as [Wolverine](https://www.ign.com/games/marvels-wolverine) for a drastically more violent take on the Marvel universe.

Elsewhere in the sale, you can find God of War Ragnarok for just $20, and big savings on Collector’s Editions for both Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and Ghost of Yotei - two of 2025’s biggest releases.
