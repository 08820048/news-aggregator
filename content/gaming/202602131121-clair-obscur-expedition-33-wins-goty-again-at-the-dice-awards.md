[_Clair Obscur__: Expedition 33_](https://www.polygon.com/game/clair-obscur-expedition-33/548832/)'s [run of Game of the Year awards](https://www.polygon.com/clair-obscur-goty-awards-elden-ring/) continues unbroken. Sandfall Interactive's game claimed five awards, including the top prize, at the DICE Awards in Las Vegas on Thursday night. It also won Role-Playing Game of the Year and Outstanding Achievement in Game Direction, Art Direction, and Story. More silverware to stick on the shelf next to their [French knighthoods](https://www.polygon.com/expedition-33-knighted-france-clair-obscur-what-does-it-mean/).

Sucker Punch's _Ghost of Y__ōtei_ took home three awards: Adventure Game of the Year, Outstanding Achievement in Character for heroine Atsu, and Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition — a mild upset, since _Clair Obscur_ has won the lion's share of soundtrack awards this season.

_Blue Prince_ won DICE's indie game and game design awards. _Hades 2_ was named Action Game of the Year, and _Arc Raiders_ won Online Game of the Year.

The Game Awards is often thought of as gaming's Oscars, as it's the industry's highest-profile award ceremony. But the DICE Awards are actually closer to the Oscars in spirit, since they're voted on by an industry body much like the film Academy, while The Game Awards are selected by a media jury. The DICE jury rarely makes controversial picks or deviates from the same consensus as The Game Awards, however.

A GOTY win at the DICE Awards moves _Clair Obscur_ one step closer to a rare sweep of the [Big Five game of the year awards](https://www.polygon.com/clair-oscur-big-five-goty-awards-dice-tga-bafta-gdc-joysticks/): the Golden Joystick awards, The Game Awards, DICE, and the GDC Awards, with the BAFTA Games Awards as the unpredictable final boss in April. Only one game has ever won all five: 2023's _Baldur's Gate 3._
