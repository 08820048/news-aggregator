Wolfbox just released a new model in its "Mega Flow" series of electric air dusters. The [Wolfbox MF60](https://zdcs.link/z3ORdm?object_uuid=083296de-2871-451d-9729-7c9d0013d972&t=article) Cordless Electric Air Duster has a list price of $49.99, but Amazon is offering a 36% off coupon code "**3WAQD8AD**" that drops it to $31.94 with free shipping. The MF60 looks nearly identical to the [$80 MF100](https://zdcs.link/QK8OJn?object_uuid=083296de-2871-451d-9729-7c9d0013d972&t=article) but with slightly less powerful airflow and fewer accessories. At less than half the price, it's definitely a better value. Wolfbox is well-rated for its great build quality and sustained, powerful cfm output at an affordable price.

New Release

### Wolfbox MF60 Cordless Electric Air Duster

The Wolfbox MF60 cordless rechargeable electric air duster is a fairly straightforward device. An internal fan spins at up to 110,000RPM to move an appreciable amount of air. A nozzle funnels the air into a tight, high-velocity stream that's more than strong enough to blast away the layers of dust and debris that's been accumulating on your PC components. It has three speed settings, although I would recommend keeping it at the max speed for optimal results. You also get five different sized nozzles, including a narrow funnel for tight spaces like the crevices in your keyboard and a wider nozzle for general PC cleaning. The internal 5,000mAh battery capacity lasts up to 240 minutes at the slowest setting and recharges over USB Type-C in under four hours.

The build quality is excellent compared to other air dusters on Amazon that cost under $50, which are all based on the same X3/X3 Mini design with 3D printed plastic parts. The nozzle attachments are also more secure since the Wolfbox uses a twist-lock mechanism whereas most other air dusters use a push-fit design that often fails during use. If you're looking to get something as cheap as possible, then a [$20 air duster](https://www.ign.com/articles/get-a-cordless-rechargeable-electric-air-duster-for-your-pc-for-just-20) will save you money in the short term, but get the Wolfbox MF100 if you want something that lasts.
