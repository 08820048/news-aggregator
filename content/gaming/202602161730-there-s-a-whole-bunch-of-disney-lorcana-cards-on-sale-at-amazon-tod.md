Amazon has some excellent deals on Disney Lorcana cards today, and in particular, you can currently pick up a [Booster Display set of Azurite Sea for just $90.50](https://zdcs.link/QxeP3p?object_uuid=733b85fb-6d00-4819-8dca-3793d630202f&t=article). That's a significant 37% drop from the list price of $143.99, and one of the best deals we've ever seen on the booster set.

That includes 24 Packs with 12 cards in each, so that's a total of 288 cards, with each pack guaranteeing at least six common and three uncommon cards, alongside two cards of rare, super rare, or legendary rarity, and finally 1 randomly selected foil card amongst these.

But, it's also worth noting that this is a limited-time lightning deal at Amazon, and once it's gone, it's gone. At this price, I wouldn't be surprised if fans snap these up as soon as possible, as there's still plenty of trading potential in Azurite Sea.

Otherwise, there are loads of other great Lorcana deals to check out at Amazon this week as well. That includes the Gateway Board Game down to just $16.30 - 35% off, and it is basically the perfect way to start playing Lorcana, or even teach you and a friend how to start off on one of the most promising new TCGs in recent years.

My other favorite in the sale is on the Azurite Sea Stitch Collector's Gift Set, which includes six collector cards and four Booster packs of 12 additional game cards in each. That's down to just $33.94 right now, and another tidy drop from the $49.99 list price.

In other Disney Lorcana news, there is a brand new [Gift Set and Collection Set up for preorder at Amazon today](https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-lorcana-new-collection-starter-set-and-scrooge-mcduck-gift-boxes-are-now-up-for-preorder), featuring Scrooge McDuck and Stitch respectively.
