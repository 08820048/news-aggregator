### Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 Open-Ear Wireless Bone Conduction Sport Headphones

The OpenRun Pro 2 is more headphone than earbud, with a lightweight titanium band connecting the two ear pieces and wrapping around the back of your head. It does an excellent job of keeping everything in place, which is important because the buds need to be positioned precisely. Instead of the traditional method of sending sound vibrations to your eardrums, the OpenRun Pro uses bone conduction technology to send vibrations through your cheekbones directly to your inner ear. As such, the headphones are actually placed in front of your ear instead of on your ear. The biggest advantage is that you can fully hear your surroundings; if you like running on streets, for example, you'll be aware of everything that's going on around you and still be able to hear your music perfectly well.

I have a pair of AirPods Pro that I use regularly, but I always set them aside for the OpenRun Pros when I run. The Transparency mode on the AirPods Pro does work well for most situations, but they still can't compare to the awareness you get without having any buds plugging up your ears. In my experience these headphones stay in place extremely well and the sound quality is good compared to other bone conduction headphones I've tried.
