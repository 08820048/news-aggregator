The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D boasts a max boost clock of 5.2GHz with 8 cores, 16 threads, and 104MB of L2-L3 cache. What really makes it excel in games, however, is the 3D-V-Cache technology that's only found in AMD's X3D lineup. Despite being the least expensive processor in this stack, the 9800X3D performs nearly identically in games compared to its more expensive siblings. It has the fewest number of cores, but that doesn't matter for gaming. [On Passmark](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/top-gaming-cpus.html), the 9800X3D has the second highest gaming score, trailing a mere 300 points behind the considerably pricier 9900X3D.

Note that there's a new 9850X3D that's now available. [We reviewed it](https://www.ign.com/articles/amd-ryzen-7-9850x3d-review) and, short answer, you're not missing out.

Crimson Desert is an upcoming open-world RPG for the PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X platforms that will be released on March 19. The studio, Pearl Abyss, also created the popular MMORPG Black Desert. Whereas Black Desert was a free-to-play game with microtransactions and gacha elements, Crimson Desert will be a primarily offline single-player experience with a retail price of $69.99. Getting it for free with your CPU upgrade, then, is a great perk.
