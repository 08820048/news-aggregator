Looking for a PS5 game deal in the [PlayStation Direct Store sale](https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-launches-a-brand-new-promotional-sale-on-ps5-games-accessories-and-more) that’s full of action? You could do a lot worse than Stellar Blade.

[Shift Up’s popular 2024 title is just $39.99 right now](https://zdcs.link/QqJ4bq?object_uuid=6d2cf9ff-cd92-4e87-87fb-e0ddfa13fdb4&t=article), a clean $10 off of its Black Friday pricing from last year. That’s a great deal, and [Target is even matching it if you prefer](https://zdcs.link/9ZA5nP?object_uuid=6d2cf9ff-cd92-4e87-87fb-e0ddfa13fdb4&t=article) to buy from there, netting you 43% off whichever way you slice it (get it? Because it’s a blade? Never mind).

### Stellar Blade

As far as technical showcases for the PlayStation 5 (or its pricier Pro sibling) go, Stellar Blade is certainly up there.

This character action title puts players in the cyber-shoes of EVE, pitting her against waves of foes and challenging boss fights, but giving her some of the flashiest combat skills in this console generation.

Our reviewer Mitchell Saltzman gave the game 7 out of 10 [in his review](https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-review) for IGN, saying “Stellar Blade is great in all of the most important ways for an action game, but dull characters, a lackluster story, and several frustrating elements of its RPG mechanics prevent it from soaring along with the best of the genre.”

If you’re here for the action, though, this saving is well worth a look. A sequel, unsurprisingly titled [Stellar Blade 2](https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-developer-confirms-sequel-plans), is in development at the time of writing.

For more sale items, the PlayStation Direct sale is well worth a look for Death Stranding fans. The Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Collector’s Edition is discounted, as well as the limited edition controller commemorating the game’s 2025 launch.
