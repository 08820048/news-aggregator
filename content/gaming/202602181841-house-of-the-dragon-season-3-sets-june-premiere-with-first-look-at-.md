HBO is keeping the Game of Thrones train going with new art for [House of the Dragon](https://www.ign.com/tv/game-of-thrones-house-of-the-dragon) Season 3 and a June release window.

The prequel spinoff series’ [official social media account](https://x.com/HouseofDragon/status/2024151996429894047?s=20) shared news of the narrowed HBO Max premiere plans today. It’s more than a simple schedule update, though, as the announcement comes with a first look at Rhaenyra Targaryen as she continues her fight to prove she is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne.

No specific release date for House of the Dragon Season 3 has been announced quite yet. However, fans won’t have to wait long for an update, as the next batch of episodes will get their first teaser trailer tomorrow.

House of the Dragon, an adaptation of author George R.R. Martin’s Fire and Blood, debuted its first season on HBO in 2022 and stars Emma D’Arcy as Rhaenyra, Olivia Cooke as Alicent Hightower, and Matt Smith as Prince Daemon Targaryen. Alongside some [key changes to the source material](https://www.ign.com/articles/george-rr-martin-slams-house-of-the-dragon-season-2-change-from-the-book-warns-of-more-toxic-changes-to-come), Season 2 mostly served to bring viewers to the edge of their seats as the war between two families brewed. We’ll see more of its story with the Season 3 premiere this June, with [Season 4 said to be its last](https://www.ign.com/articles/hbo-makes-it-official-house-of-the-dragon-ends-with-season-4).

Today’s updates arrive just days before Season 1 of HBO’s other Game of Thrones spinoff, [A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms](https://www.ign.com/tv/a-knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms), comes to an end. The show, which follows events based on Martin’s Tales of Dunk and Egg stories, stars Peter Claffey as Ser Duncan the Tall and Dexter Sol Ansell as Egg and has been positively received by fans so far. We’ve enjoyed the latest from Westeros, too, giving its newest episode [a 9/10 review](https://www.ign.com/articles/a-knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-episode-5-review).
