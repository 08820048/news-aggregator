In _Romeo Is a Dead Man_, **Bastards** are your secret weapon. Forget silly guns and blades; just send your undead minions into the fray and let them deal with the enemy. Whether they weaken, slow, distract, or electrify the opponent, they're sure to make themselves useful.

Here's a **list of all Bastards** in _Romeo Is a Dead Man_ and how to obtain them.

## How to obtain Bastard seeds in Romeo Is a Dead Man

_Romeo Is a Dead Man_ includes a **farming-sim minigame**, but instead of growing cauliflower, you'll be growing Bastards. If you don't have one yet, continue playing until you obtain your first Bastard seed. This will likely happen at the beginning of Chapter 2.

One Bastard seed is enough to start farming, but as you progress through the game, here's **how to get more Bastard seeds**:

-   **Defeat enemies:** Their chances of dropping Bastard seeds will increase in later Chapters.
-   **Loot Tesseracts:** Although they usually contain Sentrey, consumables, and ingredients to cook katsu curries, they'll occasionally give you a Bastard seed. One such Tesseract is found on the upper floor of the mall in the hall between the red portals (Chapter 2).
-   **Buy them from Siroyabu's shop:** Common, rare, and epic Bastard seeds cost 500, 1,000, and 15,000 Emerald Flowsion, respectively.

Don't worry too much about Bastard seeds, as you'll get plenty in later chapters. It's best to refrain from buying any unless you've got Emerald Flowsion aplenty.

Once you've got some Bastard seeds, bring them to Romeo's sister, **Luna**, for appraisal. She's in the Bastard harvesting room aboard the Last Night spaceship (the room marked with a plant icon).

Following the appraisal, you can **plant your Bastard seeds** in the two garden plots. They need 10 minutes to mature, but you can speed up the process using Emerald Flowsion or harvest them earlier, in which case they'll suffer a stat penalty. You can also use your Emerald Flowsion to buy more garden plots.

However, if you'd like to save Emerald Flowsion for other purposes, it's best to go on missions and frequently use a Space-Time Pharmacy to teleport to the Last Night, harvest your Bastards, and plant new ones. That way, there's no need to get extra plots or reduce harvesting time.

## How to fuse Bastards in Romeo Is a Dead Man

Besides gathering Bastard seeds, you can **create new Bastards through fusion**: You place a primary Bastard and a sub Bastard in a fighting arena, and the primary will consume the sub, thereby receiving a stat boost and possibly turning into a new type of Bastard.

There are a few important things to keep in mind when fusing Bastards:

-   A Bastard's **stats will always improve** through fusion, so even if you're not trying to create a new Bastard, feeding several common Bastards to a common SuicideAttack Bastard will get you a pretty overpowered minion.
-   If you want to follow a fusion recipe (see the list below), make sure you've selected them in the **correct order**. The Bastard you select first is the primary Bastard, the second is the sub Bastard. Otherwise, you'll create a stronger sub Bastard instead of a brand-new fusion Bastard.
-   There's a **small chance of failure**, leading to a victory for the "sub" Bastard rather than the primary one. This chance is only 1% in low-level Bastard fusion, but it may go up to 9%. It's best to save your game first, so you may retry if necessary!
