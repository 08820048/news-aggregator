21 years ago, the best standalone Star Wars game dove headfirst into the Clone Wars

Star Wars has seen plenty of great games in recent years. [_Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order_](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/11/15/20965341/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc/) and its sequel are the best games to come out of Star Wars’ partnership with EA, and [_Star Wars Outlaws_ is an underrated gem](https://www.polygon.com/opinion/599716/star-wars-outlaws-got-better-auto-fail-stealth-patch-update/) that successfully translates Ubisoft’s open-world formula to a galaxy far, far away. But none of them fill the void left behind by _Star Wars: Republic Commando_, the best Star Wars game that never got a sequel.

_Republic Commando_ takes place during the Clone Wars, a central conflict of the prequel trilogy. Instead of playing as canon-fodder regular clone troopers, you embody an elite clone commando nicknamed Boss. He’s the leader of Delta Squad, consisting of Republic Commandos Fixer, Scorch, and Sev. Together, they take on dangerous and important missions reserved for the best the clone army has to offer, like rescuing a Wookiee Chieftain. _Republic Commando_ came out before the 2008 _Clone Wars_ animated series, meaning it offered players one of their best looks yet at a foundational era and conflict in Star Wars. It also exemplified how freakin’ cool this universe is outside of Jedi, Sith, and lightsabers.

Its gameplay is top-notch, with excellent first-person shooting across a variety of levels, like a battle droid factory and the jungles of Kashyyyk. The level set on a derelict ship was incredibly creepy to 10-year-old me, and is still a bit scary now; separated from your brothers, you explore a ship shrouded in darkness and overrun by frightening, lizard-like [Trandoshan](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Trandoshan) slavers. Call me nostalgic, but I still rank _Republic Commando_ as one of the best FPS games I’ve ever played.

And I’m not alone there. Polygon ranked it as one of the [10 Star Wars games every fan needs to play](https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/22363816/star-wars-video-games-best/) in 2021, and it pops up in rankings of the best Star Wars games from a [variety](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-star-wars-games/) of [other](https://screenrant.com/best-star-wars-video-games-ranked-metacritic/) [outlets](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-star-wars-games). Its [78 on Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/game/star-wars-republic-commando/critic-reviews/?platform=pc) doesn’t do _Republic Commando_ justice — people freakin’ _love_ this game. That’s why it’s such a shame a sequel never manifested.

It wasn’t for lack of ideas on LucasArts’ part. According to lead developer Brett Douville, there were two stories in contention for a potential sequel. “In one, you would have played the side story of _Revenge of the Sith_ and carried out Order 66, hunting down Jedi as a team. In the other, Sev would have been the first man in the Rebellion army — the tagline was something like, ‘Every Rebellion begins with a single soldier,’” he said in a 2016 interview (via [Kotaku](https://kotaku.com/both-of-republic-commandos-sequel-pitches-sounded-aweso-1758371079)).

I don’t know about you, but I’d gladly play either of those games. (Though, the idea of hunting down Jedi as Boss & co. does admittedly sound rather dreary…). But a sequel wasn’t meant to be; Douville said LucasArts underwent a company-wide “reboot” before those ideas could be formally pitched. We all know what eventually happened a short time later: Disney bought Lucasfilm and everything underneath its umbrella in 2012, shuttered LucasArts’ development teams, and ceased development on several projects that were in the works, most notably [_Star Wars 1313_](https://www.polygon.com/22904417/star-wars-1313-boba-fett-gameplay-video/).

Since then, Star Wars fans had to endure EA’s exclusivity with the license, which resulted in only two Battlefront reboot titles, two Jedi games, and 2020’s _Rogue Squadron_ in terms of console releases. Now that EA’s exclusivity has expired, Disney is free to license Star Wars to other studios, which has resulted in _Star Wars Outlaws_ as well as a myriad of announcements for other games, such as [_Star Wars: Galactic Racer_](https://www.polygon.com/star-wars-galactic-racer-trailer-sebulba-game-awards/), [_Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic_](https://www.polygon.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-casey-hudson-the-game-awards/), and the [_Knights of the Old Republic_ remake](https://www.polygon.com/23279769/star-wars-kotor-remake-ps5-aspyr-delayed/). More games from EA are on the way as well, including a third Jedi title and [_Star Wars Zero Company_](https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/560074/star-wars-zero-company-xcom-game-reveal/).

But nowhere in that list is a _Star Wars: Republic Commando_ sequel. Hell, I’d even settle for a spruced up reboot at this point, if it meant a renewed spotlight on the game could potentially drum up interest in making a brand-new sequel. If a follow-up game never materializes, at least we have some Star Wars novels to enjoy that continue Delta Squad’s journey. While Karen Traviss’ Republic Commando series begins by following another batch of clone commandos, Omega Squad, the game’s Delta Squad become featured players starting in the second book, _Triple Zero_.

_Republic Commando_ turns 21 today, March 1. To celebrate, let’s raise a pint to the best Star Wars game to never get a sequel.
