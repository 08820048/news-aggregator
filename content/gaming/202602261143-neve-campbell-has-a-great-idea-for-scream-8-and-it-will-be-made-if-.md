It doesn’t sound like [Scream 7](https://www.ign.com/movies/scream-7) is the end for the horror franchise — Neve Campbell, who plays protagonist Sidney Prescott, already has a “great” idea for Scream 8, and it will be made as long as Scream 7 is a success.

Speaking to [Deadline](https://deadline.com/2026/02/kevin-williamson-neve-campbell-brainstorming-scream-8-1236737021/), Scream 7 writer and director Kevin Williamson confirmed that he and Campbell started discussing Scream 8 as they worked on this new movie.

“When you’re sitting on the set at 3am in the morning, you’re like, ‘Well, what would Scream 8 be about?’ And you just start spit-balling,” Williamson said. “And Neve had this great idea, and everyone seemed to run with it So yeah, if this movie works and people want it, we’re here for the fans. So, if they want it, we’ll certainly give it to them.”

Early indications are that Scream 7 is set for box office success. [The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/scream-7-box-office-preview-1236514231/) said Scream 7 is projected to debut with a 3-day total that lands between $40 and $45 million at the domestic box office, up on prior projections.

Earlier this week, [Campbell confirmed that she skipped 2022’s Scream 6 because her salary offer didn’t reflect the 25 years of dedication she felt she gave to this story](https://www.ign.com/articles/neve-campbell-insists-scream-6-salary-offer-did-not-value-her-legacy-but-it-sounds-like-she-got-a-big-payday-for-scream-7). “When I made that decision, I just didn’t think I could live with myself walking on set,” the actress recently told [CBS Mornings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq0pUPW_MSo) in an interview about Scream 7. “I just didn’t feel right. I just knew that my value to this franchise was bigger than what had been offered. For me, I needed to make that choice.”

According to [Variety](https://variety.com/2026/film/box-office/scream-7-rewrites-neve-campbell-salary-melissa-barrera-firing-1236671347/), Campbell secured a nearly $7 million deal for Scream 7, whereas Scream mainstay Courteney Cox was paid $2 million.
