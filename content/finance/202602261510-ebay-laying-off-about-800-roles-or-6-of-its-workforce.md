[EBay](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/EBAY/) said Thursday it is cutting about 800 roles, or 6% of its workforce, in the latest round of layoffs at the e-commerce company.

"We are taking steps to reinvest across our business and align our structure with our strategic priorities, which will affect certain roles across our workforce," an eBay spokesperson said in a statement. "We are grateful for the contributions of the employees impacted and are committed to supporting them with care and respect."

EBay said the job cuts are spread across the company, and that decisions were made based on operating-model needs, areas of duplication and alignment to future priorities.

The company had 12,300 employees worldwide as of Dec. 31, 2025, according to its latest [annual filing](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001065088/4b8768a8-fbbe-45c5-a6e9-5f0830508b0a.pdf).

Earlier this week, eBay reached a [settlement](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/couple-harassed-by-ebay-employees-settle-lawsuit-against-company-ex-ceo-2026-02-25/) with a Massachusetts couple who were victims of a harassment campaign waged by several former employees.

David and Ina Steiner sued eBay in federal court in 2021 after they were stalked and harassed by employees who were angered by coverage on their blog, [EcommerceBytes](https://www.ecommercebytes.com/). [Two former eBay executives](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/29/former-ebay-executives-given-jail-time-for-cyberstalking-scheme.html) were given prison time in 2022 over the scheme. Terms of the settlement weren't disclosed.

EBay has [continued to trim](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/23/ebay-to-slash-about-1000-roles-or-approximately-9percent-of-full-time-employees.html) [its headcount](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/07/ebay-layoffs-500-jobs-cut-.html) in recent years, while at the same time spending more on artificial intelligence. The company has implemented AI tools internally, and looked to infuse the technology across its buyer and seller experiences. It's also partnered with [OpenAI](https://innovation.ebayinc.com/stories/ebay-openai-operator-assistant/) on its agentic web browser.

The investments come as eBay is vying to compete with larger, faster-growing rivals [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/) and [Walmart](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WMT/), and other online marketplaces like [Etsy](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ETSY/), TikTok Shop, Temu and Shein.

EBay last week [announced](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/18/ebay-buying-depop-etsy.html) plans to acquire Etsy's secondhand clothing marketplace Depop for about $1.2 billion in cash. The deal should give eBay a greater leg up with consumers under the age of 34, which make up about 90% of Depop's user base.

CEO Jamie Iannone said Depop would also allow eBay to grow its presence in fashion, which has emerged as one of the company's fastest-growing categories.

The company has leaned into its other so-called "focus categories," which include collectibles, car parts and accessories and refurbished goods.

EBay said in its fourth-quarter earnings report last week that gross merchandise volume from focus categories grew more than 16% year over year.
