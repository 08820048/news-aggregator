The Kremlin on Thursday said it is actively discussing what help it can provide to [fuel-starved Cuba](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/09/cuba-airlines-fuel-energy-oil-us-trump-pressure.html), dismissing U.S. President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/)'s [tariff threat](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2026/01/addressing-threats-to-the-united-states-by-the-government-of-cuba/) to sanction countries that send oil to the Caribbean island.

"We wouldn't want any escalation, but on the other hand, we don't have much trade right now," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters, according to [Russian state news outlet RIA Novosti](https://ria.ru/20260212/peskov-2073883646.html).

His comments came in response to a question about whether the Kremlin was concerned about the Trump administration's tariff threats.

The White House has pledged to impose tariffs on countries that provide any oil to Cuba, whether directly or indirectly, saying the communist-run government represents an "unusual and extraordinary threat."

The U.S. has stepped up its pressure campaign on Cuba's leadership since Jan. 3, when it conducted an extraordinary [military operation](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/03/trump-us-operation-captured-venezuela-president-nicolas-maduro.html) to depose Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a longtime ally of Cuba's government.

Peskov reportedly said Thursday that Moscow would seek to engage in "constructive dialogue" with the U.S. over Cuba's deepening energy crisis.

"It's clear that it's impossible to discuss these issues in such a public manner right now for obvious reasons," Peskov [said](https://ria.ru/20260212/kreml-2073888992.html).

Cuba, which has been the subject of a U.S. trade embargo for more than 60 years, is mired in a worsening economic crisis.

As such, Cuba's government recently outlined emergency measures designed to protect essential services and ration fuel supplies for key sectors.

The plan [reportedly](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/cuba-adopts-urgent-measures-address-022620716.html) includes restrictions on fuel sales, the closure of some tourist establishments, shortening school days and a reduction of the working week at state-owned companies to four days, from Monday to Thursday.

Cuba's leadership [warned](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/09/cuba-airlines-fuel-energy-oil-us-trump-pressure.html) on Sunday that international airlines would no longer be able to refuel in the country due to an ongoing aviation fuel shortage.

[Air Canada](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AC-CA/) [subsequently canceled all flights](https://www.aircanada.com/media/air-canada-suspending-cuba-service-in-response-to-aviation-fuel-shortage/) to the island, though the airline said Monday that it would bring some 3,000 customers already in the country back home over the coming days.
