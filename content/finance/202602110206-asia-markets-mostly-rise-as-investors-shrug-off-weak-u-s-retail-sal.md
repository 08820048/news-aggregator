Asia-Pacific markets traded mostly higher Wednesday, continuing their rally despite AI fears and weak economic data spooking U.S. investors.

The U.S. December retail sales report showed that [consumer spending was flat](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/december-retail-sales-were-flat-missing-expectations.html), missing the 0.4% monthly gain that economists polled by Dow Jones were expecting.

In Asia, investors are assessing the latest data coming out from China.

The country's consumer price index rose 0.2% in January from a year earlier, China's National Bureau of Statistics data showed Wednesday. That's below economists' forecast of 0.4% increase in a Reuters poll, a sign of continued deflationary pressure in the absence of stronger stimulus.

Australia's [S&P/ASX 200](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.AXJO/) was up 1.43%.

South Korea's [Kospi](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.KS11/) rose 0.6%, on pace for a third day of gains, while the small-cap Kosdaq was 0.55% higher.

Hong Kong's [Hang Seng Index](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.HSI/) added 0.13%, while the mainland CSI 300 lost 0.26%.
