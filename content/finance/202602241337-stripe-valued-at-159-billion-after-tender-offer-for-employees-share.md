[Fintech](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/05/09/stripe-co-founder-john-collison-on-ai-powering-a-good-old-fashioned-tech-race.html) startup [Stripe](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/stripe-2025-cnbc-disruptor-50.html) is now valued at $159 billion after a secondary stock sale for employees and shareholders, the company [announced](https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/stripe-2025-update) Tuesday.

The valuation shows blistering growth from a year ago, when it was valued at [$91.5 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/27/stripes-valuation-climbs-to-91point5-billion-in-secondary-stock-sale-.html). Stripe's valuation nearly tripled to $95 billion in 2021.

"In the AI era, Stripe is emerging as the default financial layer for companies at the frontier of the 'token economy' in its work with the world's top startups and enterprises," said Philippe Laffont, founder and portfolio manager of Coatue Management, one of the investment funds participating in the tender offer.

Thrive Capital, a16z, and others are also participating and Stripe will also repurchase shares, the company said in a release.

The company also [provided](https://stripe.com/annual-updates/2025) an update on its business, with total payment volume increasing to $1.9 trillion in 2025, up 34% over the year prior. Stripe said its revenue suite is on track to hit an annual run rate of $1 billion in 2026.

Founded in 2010 by brothers John and Patrick Collison, Stripe makes software that enables businesses to process payments online. The company was 10th in CNBC's [Disruptor 50](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/2025-cnbc-disruptor-50-see-the-full-list-of-companies.html) list for 2025.

The startup has emerged as one of the most valuable fintech companies, and investors have eagerly awaited a potential initial public offering. Stripe executives [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-20/stripe-s-collison-says-no-rush-for-payment-firm-to-go-public) last month they're "not in any rush" to go public.

Stripe said it was "robustly" profitable in 2025 while it continued to pursue acquisitions and invest heavily in product development.

The company acquired billing startup Metronome in January. Last year, it purchased crypto wallet provider Privy, as well as crypto startup [Bridge](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/04/stripe-closes-1point1-billion-bridge-deal-prepares-for-stablecoin-push-.html) for $1.1 billion, its largest acquisition to date.
