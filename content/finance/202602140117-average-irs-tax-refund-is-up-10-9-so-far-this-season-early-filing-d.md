The [average tax refund](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/13/average-tax-refund.html) is 10.9% higher so far this season, compared to about the same point in 2025, according to early filing data from the IRS. 

The 2026 tax season [opened Jan. 26](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/08/irs-accepting-tax-returns.html), and the [average refund amount](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/filing-season-statistics-for-week-ending-feb-6-2026) was $2,290 as of Feb. 6, up from $2,065 about one year prior, the IRS reported Friday night.

As of Feb. 6, the total amount refunded was more than $16.9 billion, up 1.9% compared to last year, according to the IRS release. That figure reflects current-year returns only.

Earlier on Friday, Treasury Secretary and acting IRS Commissioner Scott Bessent told CNBC's "Squawk Box" that refunds were up 22%. But it was unclear how many days of returns Bessent's figure reflected or what comparison period he used.

The Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The IRS release said "average refund amounts are strong," and the figure will increase in the Feb. 27 release once the agency starts issuing refunds that include [earned income tax credit](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/03/earned-income-tax-credit-eligibility-for-2024.html) or additional [child tax credit](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/06/trump-child-tax-credit.html).

"Early data \[for refunds\] can be deceiving," Andrew Lautz, director of tax policy for the Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonprofit think tank, wrote in a [tax season guide](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/issue-brief/the-2026-tax-filing-season-what-to-know/) on Jan. 22. 

Typically, filers receive a refund when they overpay taxes throughout the year via [paycheck withholdings](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/14/withhold-taxes-paycheck.html) or [estimated payments](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/14/withhold-taxes-paycheck.html). Alternatively, filers owe a balance when they don't pay enough.

In recent years, IRS data has reflected a smaller refund during the beginning of the tax season, but those payments have "risen sharply" in mid-February, Lautz wrote.

After the February peak, the average refund has "declined slightly" through the April 15 deadline, he wrote.

In 2025, the [average refund](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/filing-season-statistics-for-week-ending-oct-17-2025) for individual filers was $3,052 through Oct. 17, according to the IRS.

## Filers could see bigger tax refunds

For the 2026 filing season, the size of tax refunds has been a key political topic with the midterm elections approaching. 

President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/) has promised that 2026 will be the "[largest tax refund season of all time](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/18/trump-bigger-tax-refunds.html)" based on changes enacted via his "big beautiful bill."

The legislation [added new tax breaks](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/03/trump-big-beautiful-bill-tax-changes.html) for 2025, and the IRS did not [adjust paycheck withholdings](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-announces-no-changes-to-individual-information-returns-or-withholding-tables-for-2025-under-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act), which could result in refunds for many workers.

However, there could be "a lot of variation between taxpayers," Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation, [previously told CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/30/tax-refunds.html).

Ultimately, the size of your refund, or balance due, depends on which new tax breaks apply to your situation and how much you paid throughout the year, experts say.
