BEIJING — [Baidu](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BIDU/) plans to give users of its main smartphone app direct access to the wildly popular artificial intelligence tool OpenClaw, according to a spokesperson for the Chinese tech company.

Starting later on Friday, users who opt in can message the AI agent through Baidu's main search app to complete tasks such as scheduling, organizing files and writing code.

AI agents such as OpenClaw have surged in popularity recently for their ability to automate tasks, including [managing email](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/02/openclaw-open-source-ai-agent-rise-controversy-clawdbot-moltbot-moltbook.html) and using online services.

Previously, the Austrian-developed open-sourced AI agent could only be accessed from chat apps such as WhatsApp or Telegram. Chinese companies such as Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu have already allowed users to run OpenClaw on their cloud systems.

Baidu claims 700 million monthly active users for its search app. The company is also rolling out OpenClaw's capabilities to its e-commerce business and other services.

The rollout comes just days ahead of China's Lunar New Year holiday, as Chinese internet tech giants [race to attract new users](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/chinese-tech-companies-accelerate-ai-model-rollouts-us-rivals-deepseek-moonshot-kimi.html) and monetize their AI investments.

[Alibaba](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BABA/) has also integrated its e-commerce platforms, such as Taobao and travel site Fliggy, with its AI chatbot Qwen, and claimed it received more than 120 million consumer orders through the app in the six days through Feb. 11.

Qwen users can compare personalized product recommendations before completing payment through Alipay — all within the chatbot. Previously, the AI tool could suggest products based on prompts, but shoppers had to leave the app and navigate multiple platforms to complete their transactions.

Despite growing interest in AI agents such as OpenClaw, cybersecurity firms including CrowdStrike have [warned the public](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/what-security-teams-need-to-know-about-openclaw-ai-super-agent/) about granting OpenClaw unfettered access to enterprise systems.
