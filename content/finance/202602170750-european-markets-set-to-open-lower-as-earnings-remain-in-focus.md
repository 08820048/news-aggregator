LONDON — European stocks are expected to open lower on Tuesday as investors keep an eye on earnings.

The U.K.'s [FTSE](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.FTSE/) index is seen opening 0.2% lower, and Germany's [DAX](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.GDAXI/), France's [CAC 40](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.FCHI/) and Italy's [FTSE MIB](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.FTMIB/) are all seen down 0.4%, according to data from IG.

Regional markets edged higher on Monday, as investors [digested comments](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/15/some-europeans-welcome-rubios-warm-words-others-remain-cautious.html) from this year's Munich Security Conference.

Earnings remain in focus for investors. Miners [Antofagasta](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ANTO-GB/) and [BHP Group](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BHP-AU/) released earnings on Tuesday, as well as [InterContinental Hotels Group](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/IHG-GB/).

[Sterling](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GBP=/) fell against the dollar, down 0.5% to trade at $1.356, after the U.K.'s [earnings and employment report](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/earningsandemploymentfrompayasyouearnrealtimeinformationuk/february2026) showed that the number of payrolled workers fell 0.4% on a yearly basis to 30.3 million in January 2026.

That's 134,000 fewer employees since January 2025 and down 11,000 from the previous month. Meanwhile, the [unemployment rate](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/uklabourmarket/february2026) rose to 5.2% in December, up from 5.1% a month earlier. The pound was last down 0.4% against the [Euro](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/EURGBP=/).

Meanwhile, [German inflation](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Economy/Prices/Consumer-Price-Index/_node.html) came in at 2.1% in January, up from 1.8% the previous month, the German Federal Statistical Office reported on Tuesday.  "The rise in overall consumer prices intensified at the start of the year," Ruth Brand, president of the Federal Statistical Office, said in the release.

[Overnight, S&P 500 futures](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/@SP.1/) were near flat following two straight negative weeks for the benchmark; U.S markets were shut on Monday for Presidents' Day.

[Asian financial markets](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/17/asia-markets-make-cautious-start-oil-rises-on-us-iran-talks.html) were treading carefully on Tuesday in holiday-thinned trading, with mainland Chinese, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea markets closed on Tuesday for Lunar New Year holidays.
