[Yale University](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/25/yale-treasury-scott-bessent-trump-fascism-us.html) said Wednesday that it has barred professor [David Gelernter](https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/author/david-gelernter/) from teaching computer science classes, for now, as the university conducts a review of his contacts with [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/09/trump-jeffrey-epstein-ghislaine-maxwell-palm-beach-police.html), which included mentioning a Yale student for a potential project.

Gelernter's extensive email correspondence with Epstein came to light after the release of files related to Epstein by the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/epstein) in late January.

Among those files is an October 2011 email to Epstein, in which Gelernter mentions a software project to be built.

"I have a perfect editoress in mind: Yale sr, worked at Vogue last summer, runs her own campus mag, art major, completely connected, v small goodlooking blonde," [Gelernter wrote](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02723728.pdf).

The email was sent three years after Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida state court to soliciting an underage girl for prostitution. Epstein served 13 months in jail in that case.

The [Yale Daily News](https://yaledailynews.com/articles/gelernter-stops-teaching-amid-yale-review-caused-by-his-epstein-emails) reported Tuesday that Gelernter had been barred from teaching classes pending a review.

CNBC on Wednesday asked Yale about the status of Gelernter at the university and his contact with Epstein.

In an email statement to CNBC, a Yale spokeswoman said, "Yale is committed to excellence in the classroom and to fostering an environment in which all members of our community feel respected and valued."

"Last week, leadership in the School of Engineering and Applied Science became aware of reports regarding communication between a professor and a party external to the Yale community; the professor later both acknowledged and defended this communication and the action he took in connection with the communication."

"The university does not condone the action taken by the professor or his described manner of providing recommendations for his students."

"The professor's conduct is under review. Until the review is completed, the professor will not teach his class."

Gelernter did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment from CNBC.

Gelernter was seriously wounded in June 1993 when he opened a package containing an explosive device mailed to him by Ted Kaczynski, the so-called Unabomber. Gelernter lost the use of his right hand from the explosion.

Yale's action against the professor comes nearly three months after former Harvard University President [Larry Summers](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/17/larry-summers-jeffrey-epstein-harvard.html) said he was stepping back from all public commitments because of fallout over the release of emails between him and Epstein.

The correspondence included Summers seeking guidance from Epstein about pursuing a romantic relationship with a woman he described as a mentee, the Harvard Crimson newspaper reported at the time.

Summers, who is also a former U.S. Treasury secretary, took a leave from teaching classes at Harvard, as well as from his post as the director of Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School.

"I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein," Summers said in a statement obtained by CNBC at the time.

Harvard said in November that it would investigate Summers' relationship with Epstein in light of the disclosure by Congress of emails between them.

Epstein killed himself in a federal jail in New York City in August 2019, weeks after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges.
