[Applications](https://research.statista.com/?i_survey=19__b70f3460d381c74184f8e8ff4364115a&amp;PID=CNBC) are now open for the fourth edition of CNBC's World's Top Fintech Companies list, produced in partnership with market research firm Statista.

Each year, CNBC and Statista chart the top fintech players from around the world, ranging from startups to Big Tech names, across segments including payments, wealth technology, insurance and more. 

[Last year's iteration](https://www.cnbc.com/the-worlds-top-fintech-companies-2025/) included heavyweights such as [Mastercard](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MA/), Stripe and [Visa](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/V/), as well as many newer scaleups. Credit rewards company Bilt, payments upstart TerraPay and insurance platform Entsia made their debuts on the list. 

The World's Top Fintech Companies has been expanded this year, with regulation tech — companies helping others meet their financial regulatory obligations — becoming its own segment.

Over the years, fintech has progressed from a high-growth challenger segment to a core part of the global financial system, helped by a Covid-fueled race to digitize. Artificial intelligence has spurred the sector further, and has been tipped as a source of [transformative change](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2026/01/30/the-future-of-banking-risk-and-regulation-ai-and-new-technologies.html).

The global fintech market attracted [$44.7 billion in investment across over 2,200 deals](https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmgsites/uk/pdf/2025/08/pulse-of-fintech.pdf) in the first half of 2025, according to the most recent report by KPMG, although this was lower than the $54.2 billion investment seen over the six months prior.
