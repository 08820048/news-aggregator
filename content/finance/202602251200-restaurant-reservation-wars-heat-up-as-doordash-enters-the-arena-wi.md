Now available on your favorite food delivery app: restaurant reservations.

The still-simmering reservation wars of the last decade could fully reignite this year, as a shifting tech landscape pits some of the biggest players against each other to capture businesses and users alike. Reservation incumbents, delivery app newcomers and premium credit card partnerships are all ramping up the fight for a shrinking pool of diners.

Delivery giant [DoorDash](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DASH/) announced in June its $1.2 billion acquisition of SevenRooms, a reservation platform focused on direct bookings through a restaurant's own website. Several months earlier, [UberEats](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UBER/) and [Booking Holdings'](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BKNG/) OpenTable announced a partnership to integrate reservations on Uber's app. And in 2024, [American Express](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AXP/), already the owner of Resy, bought Tock, a reservation platform focused on upscale restaurants, for $400 million.

"It's three very large, very ambitious, very well-resourced companies all vying for the same exact piece of real estate, which is high-demand restaurants," Resy and Eater founder Ben Leventhal told CNBC.

Leventhal still acts as an advisor to Resy, which was bought by AmEx in 2019, although today he focuses on Blackbird Labs, a loyalty program for independent restaurants that he founded in 2022.

## Bringing restaurants online

The reservation wars initially kicked off more than 10 years ago. Leventhal's Resy burst onto the scene in 2014 and won market share, undercutting OpenTable's legacy business, by charging eateries a simple monthly fee.

At the time, OpenTable, which was founded in 1998, charged restaurants both a monthly fee and a cover for each diner who booked through the platform. These days, the company still sometimes charges a variable cover fee for seated diners, depending on the establishment.

Despite Resy's rise and buzzy partnerships with high-profile restaurants, OpenTable still significantly outstrips its rival by restaurant count.

Starting this summer, Resy will integrate the 5,000 eateries, bars and wineries that have listed on Tock onto its own platform, bringing its total number of venues to about 25,000. That's still less than half of OpenTable's roughly 60,000 restaurants.

But where OpenTable has scale, Resy has a "cool factor" and strong positioning in major cities, like New York, where dining out is big business.

And each companies' relationships with credit card companies has added a new layer to the war, too.

## Supercharging the platforms

Platinum American Express cardholders get special access to restaurant reservations at sought-after establishments, plus a $400 dining credit per year to use at Resy restaurants.

"We know that American Express card members spend close to $90 billion a year ... on dining, and it's a passion area for them," Resy CEO Pablo Rivero told CNBC. "And we know that they also spend more. People with a Resy credit on an American Express card spend over 25% more on dining transactions."

Likewise, eligible Visa and [Chase](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JPM/) cardholders get exclusive OpenTable reservations.

Those partnerships have also helped the legacy player woo some big-name restaurants away from Resy through cash incentives made possible by the credit card companies.

Recapturing top-tier restaurants with Michelin stars or James Beard awards has been a priority for OpenTable over the last five years, said OpenTable CEO Debby Soo.

"Credit card companies are looking for a perk to differentiate their cards, especially for their premium cardholders," Soo said. "Especially after Covid, the experiential has become even more important."

## Delivery's here

Now, DoorDash is entering the fray with its SevenRooms acquisition.

The company is used to fighting for market share in a competitive industry. Before the pandemic, DoorDash was up against UberEats and Grubhub for market dominance of online third-party food delivery.

As of 2025, DoorDash was the biggest player in the U.S. market, with about 67% share, according to digital restaurant operations firm Deliverect. UberEats trails with a 23% share.

As it enters the bookings game, DoorDash is looking to capture the range of dining possibilities, whether it's delivery, takeout or table.

In the early months of its reservations integration, the platform was offering users DoorDash cash per booking to use on future delivery orders. And in select cities, it offers exclusive tables at trendy spots for members of DashPass, its subscription service.

Above all, the integration with SevenRooms gives DoorDash and its restaurants access to more data about diners.

"Delivery and dine-in have typically been siloed data sets," SevenRooms co-founder Joel Montaniel said. "So if a customer has ordered six times, and they're coming into the restaurant for the first time, are they a first-time customer or a seventh-time customer?"

Following a diner across touchpoints means a better experience, and more tailored marketing, he said.

"We're seeing the flywheel happening and the excitement about the DoorDash reservation marketplace happening, but it's still early days," said Parisa Sadrzadeh, vice president of strategy and operations for DoorDash. "We've got a lot of room to continue to grow."
