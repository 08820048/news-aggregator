[OpenAI](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/19/nvidia-is-in-talks-to-invest-up-to-30-billion-in-openai-source-says.html) is telling investors that it's now targeting roughly $600 billion in total compute spend by 2030, months after CEO [Sam Altman](https://www.cnbc.com/sam-altman/) touted $1.4 trillion in infrastructure commitments.

The [artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/) company is providing a lower number and more defined timeline for its planned spending, sources told CNBC, as broader concerns mounted that expansion ambitions were too great for the potential revenue that would follow.

OpenAI is projecting that its total revenue for 2030 will be more than $280 billion, with nearly equal contributions from its consumer and enterprise businesses, said the sources, who asked not to be named because the information is private. The spending plan the company is offering is meant to more directly tie to its expected revenue growth, the people said.

In the back half of last year, OpenAI announced a [flurry of multibillion-dollar infrastructure deals](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/28/a-look-at-openais-tangled-web-of-dealmaking.html), partnering with leading chipmakers and cloud companies.

OpenAI is finalizing a massive funding round that could total more than $100 billion, with about 90% coming from strategic investors, one person said. [Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/) is in discussions to invest up to [$30 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/19/nvidia-is-in-talks-to-invest-up-to-30-billion-in-openai-source-says.html) in [OpenAI](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/openai-cnbc-disruptor-50.html) as part of the round that could value the company at a $730 billion pre-money valuation, CNBC has confirmed.

In addition to Nvidia, strategic investors in the funding include SoftBank and [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/).

OpenAI generated $13.1 billion in revenue in 2025, the sources said, up from its $10 billion target. The company burned through $8 billion, lower than its $9 billion target, they said.

The startup was founded as a nonprofit research lab in 2015, and it rocketed into the mainstream following the launch of its chatbot ChatGPT in 2022. ChatGPT now supports more than 900 million weekly active users, the people said, up from 800 million as of October.

OpenAI declared a "[code red](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/02/open-ai-code-red-google-anthropic.html)" in December to focus on improving the chatbot in the face of competition from rivals Google and Anthropic. ChatGPT had a dip in growth in the fall, but is back to record highs in both weekly active and daily active users, the people said.

The company's coding product, [Codex](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/02/openai-codex-app-apple-computers.html), has surpassed more than 1.5 million weekly active users, the people said. Codex competes directly with Anthropic's Claude Code, which has seen a wave of adoption over the last year.
