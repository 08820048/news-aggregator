As geopolitical tensions between the EU and the U.S. escalate, these charts show how reliant the continent is on American tech providers, despite pledges to become more independent.

Since returning to the White House last year, U.S President Donald Trump [imposed tariffs](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/tariff-revenue-soars-more-than-300percent-as-us-awaits-supreme-court-decision.html) on the continent and caused headaches and fear in Europe as he initially [refused](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/08/why-trumps-pursuit-of-greenland-could-be-cheered-on-by-russia.html) to rule out military action to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory**,** before backtracking.

With the long-standing transatlantic alliance looking uncertain, European governments are increasingly moving to develop digital autonomy. Critics of Europe's reliance on U.S. companies for digital infrastructure warn that U.S. law enforcement can request user data from American companies, regardless of where the data is stored, as part of the Cloud Act.

But tech providers from the other side of the Atlantic still dominate in Europe.

European cloud providers have been steadily losing ground to U.S. rivals over the past nine years, holding under 15% of the market in 2025, according to data from Synergy Research Group, a market analytics company.

"It will be incredibly difficult for European cloud providers to meaningfully reverse the market share trend," John Dinsdale, the group's chief analyst, told CNBC.

"This is a game of scale. In order to be a leading player, you have to be continually investing large amounts in research, service development, technical infrastructure, customer support and channel partners," he added. "You also have to have the brand recognition and ability to operate globally or at least across multiple geographies."

[Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/), [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/) and [Google](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/) control more than 70% of the European cloud market, while the European companies with the largest share of the market are German duo [SAP](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/undefined/) and [Deutsche Telekom](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DTE-DE/), with 2% each, per Synergy data.

"If you were able to go back 10 years and rewrite history, maybe one or two European companies could and should have set out their stall to be a leading player in the cloud market, but they didn't," said Dinsdale.

Amazon gained a huge early mover advantage by acting first in the market, he said, adding that Microsoft and Google followed at a distance. "Oracle eventually got serious about the cloud and is now growing rapidly, and neocloud companies are targeting specific services with some success."

While SAP commands the biggest share of Europe's enterprise software market, at least 59% is held by U.S companies, according to data from a December report by the European Parliament, with [Oracle](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ORCL/) and Microsoft controlling 18% and 10%, respectively. The enterprise software market data refers to Europe as a whole, including non-EU members such as the UK and Switzerland.

Many political leaders are now "looking at technology in a way to gain sovereignty," SAP CEO Christian Klein told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Friday, in terms of "not only where do we store the data and how we manage the data, but also how to gain sovereignty on the software side."

Customer relationship management software is a sector dominated by a single player in [Salesforce](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CRM/), with SAP taking second spot, data from the European Parliament report, referring just to the 27 members of the European Union**,** showed.
