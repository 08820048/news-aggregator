Japan's headline inflation rate fell to 1.5% in January, its lowest level since March 2022.

The reading ended a run of 45 straight months in which inflation had remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target.

Core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, eased to 2%, the lowest level since January 2024 and matching the 2% forecast by economists polled by Reuters. It was down from 2.4% in [December](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/23/japan-december-inflation-rice-prices-snap-election-sanae-takaichi-boj.html).

The so-called "core-core" inflation — excluding prices of fresh food and energy — came in at 2.6%, compared with 2.9% in December.

The slowdown was driven by declines in fresh food, raw meat and fresh flower prices, as well as a sharper drop in petroleum products.

Goods inflation fell to 1.6% from 2.7%, its lowest level since August 2021, while services inflation held steady at 1.4%.

In January, the Bank of Japan upgraded its inflation forecasts for fiscal 2026, which begins April 1. It projected core inflation at 1.9% and "core-core" inflation at 2.2%, up from 1.8% and 2%, respectively, in its October 2025 outlook.

The BOJ also wrote in its [outlook](https://www.boj.or.jp/en/mopo/outlook/gor2601a.pdf) that the year-over-year rise in consumer prices is likely to fall below 2% in the first half of 2026, as food prices stabilize and government efforts to ease living costs.

Rice inflation slowed for an eighth straight month to 27.9%.

Among those measures is an election pledge by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi to suspend an 8% food tax for two years.

The inflation reading comes after Japan's economy grew 0.1% in the fourth quarter on Monday, [narrowly avoiding a technical recession](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/16/japan-fourth-quarter-gdp-reverses-into-growth-but-misses-expectations-as-rebound-underwhelms.html).

Despite the slowdown in headline inflation, the Bank of Japan is unlikely to delay rate hikes, according to Norihiro Yamaguchi, lead Japan economist at Oxford Economics.

He said fresh-food prices remain volatile, while energy costs fell after Japan scrapped its fuel tax in December.

As a result, the core-core index, which excludes fresh foods and energy, provides a clearer gauge of underlying price pressures, easing only gradually to 2.6% from 2.9%.

Yamaguchi expects the BOJ to raise rates to 1% at its June meeting, after assessing spring wage negotiation data.
