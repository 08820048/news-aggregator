The third annual [CNBC Changemakers](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/25/changemakers-list-women-business-leadership.html) list of women transforming business and philanthropy, which launched on Wednesday, recognizes leaders at the forefront of AI and innovators across traditional fields, from finance to healthcare, retail, entertainment and sports.

The 2026 Changemakers range from startup founders to high-profile stars such as [Kim Kardashian](https://www.cnbc.com/kim-kardashian-2026-changemaker/), who grew Skims to a $5 billion valuation with a big [Nike](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NKE/) partnership, and [Selena Gomez](https://www.cnbc.com/selena-gomez-2026-changemaker/), whose Rare Beauty has been valued by outside sources at close to $3 billion and includes a philanthropic organization tackling mental health issues.

AI is a key trend on this year's list, with a range of female leaders innovating the fundamental technology and its applications. [Mira Murati](https://www.cnbc.com/mira-murati-2026-changemaker/), former OpenAI chief technology officer, launched Thinking Machines Lab to push the boundaries of next-generation AI. [Tekedra Mawakana](https://www.cnbc.com/tekedra-mawakana-2026-changemaker/), co-CEO of Waymo, expanded autonomous driving into new cities and forged multiple transportation partnerships. Applying AI to fixing the foster care system, Binti CEO [Felicia Curcuru](https://www.cnbc.com/felicia-curcuru-2026-changemaker/) launched responsible AI tools for social services in collaboration with Anthropic.

Curcuru is a perfect example of a leader pursuing purpose along with profits, which is the mission of many of the business leaders on the list. [Gilead Sciences](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GILD/) chief commercial officer [Johanna Mercier](https://www.cnbc.com/johanna-mercier-2026-changemaker/) introduced and expanded access to a first-of-its-kind HIV prevention medicine around the world. Lupin CEO [Vinita Gupta](https://www.cnbc.com/vinita-gupta-2026-changemaker/) spearheaded a landmark effort to reshore medicine manufacturing. Paragonix Technologies CEO [Lisa Anderson](https://www.cnbc.com/lisa-anderson-2026-changemaker/) developed a new device to transport kidneys for transplant. 

Several of this year's Changemakers are growing the business and audience of women's sports: U.S. Ski & Snowboard president & CEO [Sophie Goldschmidt](https://www.cnbc.com/sophie-goldschmidt-2026-changemaker/), F1 Academy founder and managing director [Susie Wolff](https://www.cnbc.com/susie-wolff-2026-changemaker/), Professional Women's Hockey League's [Jayna Hefford](https://www.cnbc.com/jayna-hefford-2026-changemaker/) and [Amy Sheer](https://www.cnbc.com/amy-scheer-2026-changemaker/), and Monarch Collective & Angel City's [Kara Nortman](https://www.cnbc.com/kara-nortman-2026-changemaker/), who is investing in women's teams around the world. Big East Commissioner [Val Ackerman](https://www.cnbc.com/val-ackerman-2026-changemaker/) has broken barriers and is reconfiguring college athletics. 

Our goal in launching the Changemakers list in 2024 was to highlight leaders who have defied the odds.

Women still comprise just 11% of Fortune 500 CEOs, and that's a record high. For the 11th consecutive year, women remain underrepresented at every level of the leadership pipeline, starting at manager, with 29% of C-suite roles held by women, steady with the prior year, according to McKinsey. New female board appointments fell to the lowest level recorded by Equilar in the third quarter of 2025. And for the first time in over 60 years, the gender pay gap widened for two years in a row.

By those metrics, [and many others](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/25/changemakers-how-we-chose-list-of-women-business-leaders.html), CNBC Changemakers have succeeded despite the odds, and are, by definition, exceptional. Their stories of grit, innovation, and creativity reveal how a wide variety of backgrounds and leadership styles can enable anyone to thrive. We find their stories an inspiration and believe you will as well.

We will be celebrating the 2026 Changemakers on April 16 in New York during a half-day summit. [Join me there](https://www.cnbcevents.com/cnbc-changemakers-2026/?utm_source=Dotcom&amp;utm_medium=Page&amp;utm_campaign=CM) for a series of interviews and conversations about leadership, innovation, understanding consumers, and more.
