The [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/congress-ice-dhs-johnson-government-shutdown.html) is barreling toward a shutdown starting this weekend after Senate [Democrats](https://www.cnbc.com/democrats/) and the [White House](https://www.cnbc.com/white-house/) on Thursday failed to clinch a deal on immigration enforcement restrictions.

A bill already approved by the House of Representatives, which would fund DHS through the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, failed on Thursday to clear a procedural hurdle in the Senate, meaning time will run out before a shutdown can be avoided.

Sen. [Chris Murphy](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/10/04/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-u-s-senator-chris-murphy.html), a Connecticut Democrat, shortly after that vote also objected to the immediately considering what would have been the second two-week-long stopgap funding for DHS while negotiations continue.

Congress went into a week-long recess after Murphy's objection, making a shutdown set to begin at 12:01 a.m. ET Saturday.

The looming shutdown comes as Democratic senators continue to negotiate directly with the White House and President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/) on a deal that could unlock DHS funding.

Democrats want new restrictions on immigration officers, citing the killing of two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis in January by federal agents who were there to conduct immigration enforcement.

The rest of the federal government is funded through Sept. 30, the end of the federal fiscal year.

The public is not likely to be significantly affected if DHS shuts down, because most of the department's employees would be deemed as essential workers, who would not be furloughed.

However, many employees will be required to work without pay, especially if the shutdown drags on for a long time.

The shutdown would hit employees at DHS's sub-agencies, including the Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

The TSA shutdown could affect travelers going through airport security, especially if agents miss their next paycheck in March.

"DHS essential missions and functions will continue as they do during every shutdown," a DHS spokesperson told CNBC.

"However, during a shutdown, many employees will be forced to work without pay, putting strain on the frontline defenders of our nation."

So far, Democrats and the White House appeared far apart on their terms for a deal to restore full funding to DHS.

"Today's strong vote was a shot across the bow to Republicans. Democrats will not support a blank check for chaos," Senate Minority Leader [Chuck Schumer](https://www.cnbc.com/chuck-schumer/), D-N.Y., at a press conference after Thursday's vote.

Schumer threw cold water on the White House's latest offer.

"Their proposal is not serious," Schumer said. He declined to detail the sticking points.

Democrats are pushing for a series of changes at DHS. They want a requirement for agents to wear body cameras, a bar on agents wearing masks and a requirement for judicial warrants for arrests. The Democrats also want an end to "roving patrols," a term they have used to describe the administration's dragnet immigration operations.

A senior White House official said the judicial warrants are a "particularly challenging aspect," according to MS Now. The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the administration won't accept changes that affect its ability to deploy its immigration enforcement agenda.

If a deal is reached, both chambers of Congress could come back from their recess and pass it.

But it's far from clear that a deal will be clinched over the next week.

And, many lawmakers are set to be in Germany then for the Munich Security Conference.

"If and when there's a breakthrough, we'll make sure people are here to vote on it," said Majority Leader [John Thune](https://www.cnbc.com/john-thune/), R-S.D.
