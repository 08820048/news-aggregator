[Bill Gates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/28/bill-gates-says-countries-need-to-rethink-their-climate-strategy.html) spoke about his association with [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/15/epstein-files-fallout-goldman-ruemmler-harvard-yale.html) in a town hall meeting with employees of the [Gates Foundation](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2026/01/21/bill-gates-on-gates-foundation-openai-partnership-impact-of-ai-on-jobs.html), a spokesperson for the nonprofit said Wednesday, after recently released emails elaborated on the [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/) co-founder's relationship with the sex offender.

Gates said in a recording of the meeting that he "did nothing illicit" during his interactions with Epstein and did not stay overnight, although they met in several countries, The [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bill-gates-apologizes-to-foundation-staff-over-epstein-ties-67f39ef5) reported.

Gates also told staff members at the Tuesday meeting that he had an affair with a Russian bridge player and a Russian nuclear physicist and that associate [Boris Nikolic](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/24/technology/jeffrey-epstein-microsoft-executives.html) had discussed those relationships with Epstein, according to the Journal.

He and Melinda French, who once were co-chairs of the foundation, [divorced in 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/02/bill-and-melinda-french-gates-are-officially-divorced.html).

"In the conversation, Bill answered questions submitted by foundation staff on a range of issues, including the release of the Epstein files, the foundation's work in AI, and the future of global health," a Gates Foundation representative told CNBC in an email. "In the townhall, Bill spoke candidly, addressing several questions in detail, and took responsibility for his actions."

Politicians, academics and business executives [have been implicated](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/15/epstein-files-fallout-goldman-ruemmler-harvard-yale.html) in the millions of pages of documents the Justice Department released in January, leading some to give up their roles.

Earlier this week [Dr. Peter Attia](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/23/epstein-files-peter-attia-cbs-news.html) resigned from his position as a CBS News contributor after he said the Epstein emails involving him were "embarrassing, tasteless, and indefensible."

For years, Gates has maintained that it was a mistake to be involved with the disgraced former financier. Last week, the foundation said Gates would not appear at an artificial intelligence summit in [India](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/19/amid-epstein-fallout-bill-gates-becomes-point-of-controversy-at-india-ai-summit-.html) as planned.

In new documents released by the Department of Justice that included a trove of emails, Gates and Epstein discuss philanthropic fundraising, Microsoft's CEO search and even a $1 bet about the performance of the euro.

The emails describe meetings with foundation staff that were then passed on to Epstein, who sometimes gave suggestions on how to proceed.

Gates' new comments came weeks after the foundation said that "on the basis of Epstein's claims that he could mobilize significant philanthropic resources for global health and development, a small number of foundation employees interacted with Epstein to try to secure this potential funding."

The foundation said it never paid Epstein and no fund was ever created.

"The harm Epstein inflicted on women and girls was horrific, and no one should ever have to experience what they did," [the statement](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/media-center/press-releases/2026/02/doj-statement) said.
