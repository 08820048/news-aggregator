Auto giant [Stellantis](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/STLA/) on Thursday reported its first-ever annual loss after booking substantial write-downs amid a major strategic shift.

The multinational conglomerate, which owns household names including Jeep, Dodge, Fiat, Chrysler and Peugeot, [posted](https://www.stellantis.com/en/news/press-releases/2026/february/full-year-2025-results) a full-year 2025 net loss of 22.3 billion euros ($26.3 billion), compared to full-year profit of 5.5 billion euros a year ago.

The net loss was impacted by 25.4 billion euros in write-downs, Stellantis said, as the firm sharply scales back its electric vehicle strategy.

The results come as carmakers across the globe look to walk back their EV plans. Car giants including [GM](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GM/), [Ford](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/F/) and [Honda](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/7267.T-JP/), for example, have all announced billions of dollars in charges to write-down EV investments in recent months. The trend underscores the shifting dynamics at play on the road to full electrification.

"Our 2025 full year results reflect the cost of over-estimating the pace of the energy transition and of the need to reset our business around our customers' freedom to choose from the full range of electric, hybrid and internal combustion technologies," Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said in a statement.

"In 2026 our focus will be on continuing to close the execution gaps of the past, adding further momentum to our return to profitable growth," he added.

Stellantis said it had suspended its dividend for 2026, as it had previously flagged, and issued up to 5 billion euros of hybrid bonds. It also reiterated its 2026 forecasts, including a mid-single-digit percentage increase in net revenues and a low-single-digit adjusted operating margin.
