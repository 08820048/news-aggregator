Bill Ackman's Pershing Square revealed a sizable stake in [Meta](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/) on Wednesday.

"We believe Meta's current share price underappreciates the company's long-term upside potential from AI and represents a deeply discounted valuation for one of the world's greatest businesses," stated the fund's annual investor presentation.

The position amounts to 10% of Pershing's capital as of the end of 2025.

Meta shares are off by 16% over the last 12 months on fears it is spending too much on artificial intelligence. The company in its [fourth-quarter earnings report in January](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/meta-q4-earnings-report-2025.html) projected AI-related capital expenditures to total in the range of $115 billion to $135 billion in 2026.

"We believe concerns around META's AI-related spending initiatives are underestimating the company's long-term upside potential from AI," stated the Pershing presentation.

Pershing noted that Meta currently trades at a 22 times its projected earnings over the next 12 months, cheap considering how much AI is set to rev up future earnings growth. Alphabet, Apple and Nvidia all have higher forward P/Es.

Pershing added the stake in the fourth quarter. The fund bought positions in [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/), [Hertz](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/HTZ/) and Meta in 2025, according to the presentation with the Amazon and Hertz stakes previously disclosed.

Last year, Pershing outperformed the [S&P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX/), with the fund's net asset value increasing by 20.9% vs. the index's 17% return.
