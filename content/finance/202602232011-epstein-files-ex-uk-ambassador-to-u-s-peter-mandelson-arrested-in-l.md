Police in London on Monday arrested [Peter Mandelson](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/08/epstein-files-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmers-chief-of-staff-quits.html), Britain's former ambassador to the [United States](https://www.cnbc.com/id/10000385), who has been under investigation for his relationship with notorious sex offender [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/12/trump-jeffrey-epstein-ghislaine-maxwell-emails-house-democrats.html).

[Metropolitan Police in London](https://news.met.police.uk/news/update-on-investigation-into-misconduct-in-public-office-offences-relating-to-a-former-government-minister-506463) said that Lord Mandelson, 72, was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office, the same grounds on which other police in Britain last week arrested and briefly detained [Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor,](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/19/epstein-files-former-prince-andrew-police-released-arrest.html) the former prince and longtime friend of Epstein.

Police did not identify Mandelson by name, as is customary in Britain, but photos of him being led from his house by police were published Monday.

Police were [known to be investigating](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/08/epstein-files-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmers-chief-of-staff-quits.html) whether he leaked market-sensitive information to Epstein when he was a government minister during the global financial crisis in 2009 and 2010.

Mandelson, who was fired in September on orders from British Prime Minister [Keir Starmer](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/uk-keir-starmer-peter-mandelson-labour-epstein-files-politics.html) after revelations about his dealings with Epstein, has previously denied any wrongdoing.

"He was arrested at an address in Camden ... and has been taken to a London police station for interview," the Metropolitan Police said in a statement.

"This follows search warrants at two addresses in the Wiltshire and Camden area," police said. "We are not able to provide further information at this stage to prevent prejudicing the integrity of the investigation."

Mandelson resigned from the House of Lords in early February.

In a statement then, he said, "I want to say loudly and clearly that I was wrong to believe \[Epstein\] following his conviction \[in 2008\] and to continue my association with him afterwards."

"I apologize unequivocally for doing so to the women and girls who suffered," Mandelson said.

Mandelson's arrest came four days after British police arrested [Mountbatten-Windsor](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/19/prince-andrew-arrest-misconduct-epstein-mountbatten-windsor.html), brother of [King Charles III](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/king-charles-strips-brother-andrew-of-titles-and-his-mansion.html), on suspicion of misconduct in public office.

Mountbatten-Windsor was released later Thursday.

While the nature of the investigation into him was not revealed, Thames Valley Police have said they were assessing reports that he had sent Epstein [confidential trade reports in 2010](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3wl6vdgqw2o), when he was Britain's special envoy for international trade.
