Asia-Pacific markets traded mostly lower Friday, tracking Wall Street declines, as fears over artificial intelligence disruption drove the [S&P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX/) to a third straight day of losses.

Certain pockets of the U.S. stock market have been hit this year by the release of AI tools that threaten automating tasks performed by some companies — or at least risk eating into their profit margins.

Shares of several trucking and logistics firms [declined on fears](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/12/trucking-and-logistics-stocks-tumble-on-release-of-ai-freight-scaling-tool.html) that new AI tools could slash major freight inefficiencies, leading to less demand for the industry's services.

Software stocks like [Palantir Technologies](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PLTR/) and [Autodesk](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ADSK/) also slipped, [plagued by disruption worries](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/04/software-stocks-plunge-us-ai-disruption.html) in recent weeks.

Real estate and financial stocks were also casualties, with commercial real estate brokers [extending losses](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/12/office-real-estate-stocks-tumble-as-ai-disruption-casualties-in-the-stock-market-grow-by-the-day.html) for a second straight day.

Investors in Asia were watching for any spillover effects. Taiwan — among the most prominent market in the AI space — was closed for the Lunar New Year holiday.

Japan's [Nikkei 225](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.N225/) lost 0.72%, after briefly touching 58,000 on Thursday. The Topix declined 0.92%. Both indexes were dragged by energy stocks.

South Korea's [Kospi](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.KS11/) added 0.31%, the only major index in positive territory, while the small-cap Kosdaq retreated 1.75%.

Hong Kong's [Hang Seng Index](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.HSI/) fell 1.69%, weighed down by basic materials stocks, while the mainland CSI 300 lost 0.51%.

Hong Kong-listed Zhipu AI, that trades as Knowledge Atlas Technology, extended its rally on Friday, up 16%, after Thursday's near-30% surge, building on investor enthusiasm around its newly launched open-source GLM-5 model.

MiniMax also added over 11%, extending gains from its last session, as momentum around its updated M2.5 model and enhanced AI agent tools continued to drive buying interest.

Beijing Haizhi Technology Group shares soared over 260% after a $97 million IPO.

Australia's [S&P/ASX 200](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.AXJO/) was 1.32% down.
