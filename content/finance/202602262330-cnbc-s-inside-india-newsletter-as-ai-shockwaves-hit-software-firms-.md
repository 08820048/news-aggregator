### The big story

Indian IT stocks are facing their steepest monthly declines since the 2008 global financial crisis, with the Nifty IT Index on track to drop 20% this month, as concerns over AI-led disruption pressure software stocks globally.

At the mega India AI summit last week, major tech companies [announced](https://www.tata.com/newsroom/business/tata-openai-partnership) tie-ups with leading Indian IT services firms to drive AI adoption across enterprises. India's largest and the world's second largest IT services company, Tata Consultancy Services, tied up with OpenAI, while Infosys [partnered](https://www.infosys.com/newsroom/press-releases/2026/advanced-enterprise-ai-solutions-industries.html) with the ChatGPT maker's rival Anthropic.

These tie-ups did little to cheer the markets with the Nifty IT index down 19.6% so far this month as investor concerns over the impact of rapid artificial intelligence advancements on the sector has dampened sentiment.

Indian IT [industry leaders](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2026/02/23/ai-implementation-is-indias-big-opportunity-says-infosys-ceo.html), however, have called AI implementation a "big opportunity."

"We are confident AI will strengthen growth across our business and unlock the next phase of opportunity for the broader IT ecosystem," Sham Arora, chief technology officer at Tech Mahindra told CNBC.

But unlike the U.S., where the [debate](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/06/ai-anthropic-tools-saas-software-stocks-selloff.html) is still on between AI fears being "illogical" and a possible collapse of companies offering software as a service, or SaaS, experts told me that AI won't make Indian firms offering IT services irrelevant. It will, however, shrink their margins.

Biswajit Maity, senior principal analyst at Gartner, told me that traditional IT services companies such as TCS, Infosys, Wipro and Accenture will play a "pivotal role in enterprise AI adoption" by leveraging their client relationships and domain expertise in integrating AI solutions.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Thursday also [attempted](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/26/nvidia-jensen-huang-gpu-ai-threat-software-companies-saas-earnings-chips.html) to play down AI concerns, suggesting that markets have miscalculated the threat to software companies.

But to remain relevant, Indian IT services companies need to invest in talent and proprietary platforms, develop industry-specific AI solutions and co-innovate with clients, among other things, Maity said. And while some of that work is [underway](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/15/cnbcs-inside-india-newsletter-ai-is-taking-over-core-operations-of-indian-it-companies.html), the efforts are unlikely to protect margins of Indian IT companies, Maity and other experts forecast.

## The pricing pressure

Indian IT companies collectively control over [one‑third of global IT services brand value](https://brandirectory.com/reports/it-services), export technology services [estimated at](https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2115413&amp;reg=3&amp;lang=2) more than $220 billion annually, and dominate the global outsourcing landscape, making them critical for the world's digital infrastructure.

But the business models of Indian IT companies are dependent on labor arbitrage, and with the advancement of AI this will soon be replaced by technology arbitrage, said Maity.

Indian IT companies get a majority of their revenue from helping enterprises with integration of IT services and digital transformation, and not SaaS. This makes AI an immediate business opportunity, but a long-term challenge.

Enterprises cannot "suddenly move away" from the services that are being provided by Infosys or TCS and "move into Anthropic" straightaway, Manishi Raychaudhuri, CEO of Asia-Pacific focused financial advisory firm Emmer Capital Partners, told CNBC's "[Inside India](https://www.cnbc.com/inside-india/)" on Monday.

But he added that clients are asking IT companies to incorporate AI agents in their services, which means that pricing would take a hit and so would the valuations of these companies.

AI will also transform the business mix of IT service companies.

A report by global brokerage firm Jefferies on Sunday said that AI could shrink the managed services business, which accounts for 22%-45% of revenues of leading Indian IT companies. This will increase cyclicality and require a change in talent and operating model — adding more risks, it said.

Managed IT services refers to IT companies handling the day-to-day management of IT needs of enterprises to provide support services, while consulting is a more cyclical business.

Jefferies said that stock performance of IT companies will "more likely" be tied to the longer-term business outlook rather than earnings delivery in the near term.

Indian IT firms play a pivotal role in enabling AI adoption by enterprises, an area where spending is projected to rise sharply, according to Gartner. It has estimated agentic AI software spending will reach $985 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 62.7% from 2025 to 2030 as enterprises scale adoption.

Jefferies, however, has cut price targets on Indian IT companies by up to 33% and downgraded most large firms to either hold or underperform.

Investors seem to side with Jefferies' assessment and appear unconvinced that AI will benefit IT services companies. With two more trading sessions to go, this month could go down as the worst for Indian IT stocks nearly two decades.
