The Kremlin on Thursday said that the situation in [fuel-starved Cuba](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/09/cuba-airlines-fuel-energy-oil-us-trump-pressure.html) is intensifying after a [deadly incident](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/26/cuba-says-it-killed-4-exiles-wounded-6-others-who-attacked-from-florida-speedboat.html) with a U.S.-registered speedboat off the coast of the Caribbean island.

"We see that the situation around Cuba is escalating," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters, according to [Russian state news outlet RIA Novosti](https://ria.ru/20260226/kuba-2076853282.html?in=l).

"The most important thing is the humanitarian component. Of course, the humanitarian issues of Cuban citizens must be resolved, and no one should create obstacles," Peskov [said](https://ria.ru/20260226/peskov-2076853490.html?in=l).

The comments come shortly after Cuba's Interior Ministry [said](https://x.com/EmbaCubaUS/status/2026732911114760673) border guards killed four exiles and wounded six others onboard a Florida-tagged speedboat that entered its territorial waters.

The 10 passengers of the vessel were said to have opened fire on a Cuban patrol off the northern coast of the island.

The individuals, all of whom were Cuban nationals residing in the U.S., were armed and some had previous criminal records, Cuba's Interior Ministry said. It added that assault rifles, handguns, improvised explosive devices and camouflage uniforms were among the items seized from the boat.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the incident as "highly unusual" and said the White House would "respond appropriately" once it had conducted an independent investigation.

The food supplies are expected to arrive in Cuba on Saturday.
