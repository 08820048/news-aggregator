[Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) Vice President Raj Jegannathan, a 13-year veteran of the automaker, announced his departure from the company on Monday in a [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/raj-jegannathan-9b566242_it-is-challenging-to-encapsulate-13-years-activity-7426733090611429377-QX5l?utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web&amp;rcm=ACoAAAAh-NQBTHrltNoDR0UEmRvTtMUTx0WCuAY).

Jegannathan's most recent role was vice president of information technology, AI infrastructure, business apps and information security. In his short LinkedIn post, Jegannathan wrote, "The journey at Tesla has been one of continuous evolution."

Last year, Jegannathan was tasked with leading the electric vehicle maker's sales team after previous North America sales leader Troy Jones was dismissed. Tesla's core automotive sales were in decline, with its brand reputation falling partly due to its aging lineup of EVs, along with a consumer backlash against CEO [Elon Musk](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/) over his incendiary political rhetoric, work for the Trump administration and backing of far-right figures and parties around the world.

Tesla and Jegannathan didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

Tesla's revenue for 2025 [dropped 3%](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/tesla-tsla-2025-q4-earnings.html), declining for the first time on record. The company is under pressure to revitalize its EV sales, and to finally deliver its long-promised driverless systems and vehicles that can carry passengers around without requiring a human at the wheel.
