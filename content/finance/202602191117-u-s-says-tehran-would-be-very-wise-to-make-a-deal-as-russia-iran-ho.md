The Trump administration has warned it would be "very wise" for Iran to make a deal, amid reports the White House is [considering](https://www.axios.com/2026/02/18/iran-war-trump-military-strikes-nuclear-talks) fresh military action against Tehran as soon as this weekend.

It comes shortly after Vice President JD Vance [accused](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/18/oil-prices-today-iran-trump-nuclear-talks.html) Iran of failing to address core U.S. demands during nuclear talks in Switzerland this week. Iran's foreign minister previously [reported](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/17/iran-us-strait-of-hormuz-oil-nuclear-talks-geneva.html) progress in the talks, saying the two countries had reached an understanding over the "guiding principles" for the negotiations.

Speaking at a news briefing Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said there were "many reasons and arguments that once could make for a strike against Iran," noting that the two countries remain "very far apart" on some issues.

The U.S. president had a "very successful" operation last June, Leavitt said, when U.S. stealth bombers struck three Iranian nuclear facilities as part of "Operation Midnight Hammer."

"The president has always been very clear though with respect to Iran or any country around the world, diplomacy is always his first option. And Iran would be very wise to make a deal with President Trump and this administration," Leavitt said.

The White House has said it still hopes to reach a diplomatic resolution over Tehran's nuclear program, although U.S. media has [reported](https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/18/politics/military-strike-trump-us-iran) that the military could be prepared to strike Iran as early as the weekend.

## 'Extremely dangerous' situation

Both the U.S. and Iran have increased military activity in the oil-producing Middle East region in recent weeks.

The U.S., for its part, has built up a significant presence of air and naval assets, while Iran has conducted military drills in the strategically vital Strait of Hormuz and [announced](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/523975/Iran-Russia-set-to-start-naval-drills-in-the-Sea-of-Oman) joint naval drills with Russia in the Sea of Oman.

Laura James, Middle East senior analyst at Oxford Analytica, described the current situation as "extremely dangerous," with the U.S. and Iran "certainly closer" to an outright conflict than last week.

"The thing that is now a particular concern over the past 24 hours is the very rapid pace at which the United States is reinforcing its air power in the region. That, of course, can still be signalling and pressure for a particular diplomatic outcome," James told CNBC's "[Access Middle East](https://www.cnbc.com/access-middle-east/)" on Thursday.

"But as more and more planes comes in and more and more equipment comes in, that signalling gets more and more expensive. And therefore, the payoff you want for it in diplomatic terms has to be larger — and there is simply no sign Tehran can offer the absolute minimum that Washington is likely to demand," she added.

### Oil prices

Energy market participants have been closely watching the outcome of the U.S.-Iran talks in Geneva, particularly as it relates to the Strait of Hormuz, a major [international waterway](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/08/strait-of-hormuz-what-supply-disruption-could-mean-for-oil-markets.html) that [Iran partially closed](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/17/iran-us-strait-of-hormuz-oil-nuclear-talks-geneva.html) on Tuesday citing "security precautions."

Located in the gulf between Oman and Iran, the Strait of Hormuz is recognized as one of the world's most important oil choke points.

Iranian military personnel take part in an exercise titled 'Smart Control of the Strait of Hormuz', launched by the Naval Forces of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, is being carried out in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz on February 16, 2026.

About 13 million barrels per day of crude oil transited the Strait of Hormuz in 2025, accounting for roughly 31% of global seaborne crude flows, data provided by market intelligence firm Kpler showed.

Oil prices were higher on Thursday morning, extending gains after settling up more than 4% in the previous session. International benchmark [Brent](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/@LCO.1/) crude futures with April delivery rose 1.1% to $71.16 per barrel, while U.S. [West Texas Intermediate](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/@CL.1/) futures with March delivery stood 1.2% higher at $66.
