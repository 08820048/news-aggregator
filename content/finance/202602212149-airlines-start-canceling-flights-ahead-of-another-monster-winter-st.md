U.S. airlines began canceling Sunday flights and waiving cancellation and change fees for airports from Virginia to Maine ahead of another massive winter storm on the East Coast, set to once again put carriers to the test at the tail-end of winter break.

[Delta Air Lines](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DAL/), [American Airlines](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAL/), [JetBlue Airways](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JBLU/), [United Airlines](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UAL/) and Spirit Airlines waived fees and fare differences for passengers if they can travel as late as Feb. 26. [Southwest Airlines](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LUV/) said customers are eligible for a change without paying a difference in fare if they can rebook to fly or fly standby within two weeks.

The storm could bring between 13 and 18 inches of snow to parts of southern Connecticut and southeast New York, as well as winds of up to 55 miles per hour, according to the National Weather Service. The blizzard warning is set to begin at 6 a.m. ET Sunday.

As of 4:30 pm ET Saturday, close to 400 U.S. flights were canceled, according to FlightAware. Delta had the most, with 174 cancellations or 5% of its mainline schedule. New York airports, which make up a major Delta hub, were the most affected by Sunday's disruptions.

The National Weather Service [raised its initial assessment](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/21/blizzard-warnings-issued-for-new-york-city-new-jersey-connecticut.html) of the potential severity of a storm. The weather service now says 1 to 2 feet (about 30 to 61 centimeters) of snow is possible in many areas. Blizzard warnings were also issued for New York City, Long Island, southern Connecticut and coastal communities in New Jersey, Delaware, Rhode Island and Massachusetts.

The weather service warned that the storm's steady winds of 25 to 35 mph (40 to 56 kph) would "make travel dangerous, if not impossible."

American Airlines had struggled to recover, drawing harsh criticism from flight crews, some of whom were stranded and had to sleep at airports, [heightening tension](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/07/american-airlines-ceo-robert-isom.html) between frontline employees and the company's CEO, Robert Isom.

The storm cost American between $150 million and $200 million in revenue, the carrier said last month on an earnings call.
