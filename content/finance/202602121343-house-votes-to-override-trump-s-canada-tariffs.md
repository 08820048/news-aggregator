The [House](https://www.cnbc.com/congress/) on Wednesday passed [a resolution](https://www.congress.gov/119/bills/hjres72/BILLS-119hjres72ih.pdf) disapproving of President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/)'s tariffs against Canada, a blow to Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and a rare Republican rebuke of the president's signature economic policy.

The resolution cleared the House 219-211, with several Republicans crossing the aisle to support it. One Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, voted against the measure.

The tariff resolution, introduced by Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., was considered a day after a [procedural vote](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/gop-tariffs-trump-house-johnson.html) on a rule that would have barred House challenges to Trump's tariffs failed with the support of three Republican members.

Trump warned Republicans during the vote that there would be consequences for overriding him on tariffs.

"Any Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time, and that includes Primaries!" Trump posted to his [TRUTH social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116054542648712986) account during the vote. "TARIFFS have given us Economic and National Security, and no Republican should be responsible for destroying this privilege."

The risk was worth it for some Republicans, especially those in swing districts where tariffs are deeply unpopular.

Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who is retiring at the end of his term and voted for the anti-tariff resolution, told reporters earlier in the day that the White House tried and failed to flip his vote.

"I voted on principle," Bacon said of a Tuesday procedural vote that allowed the measure to proceed. "They were trying to do sweeteners for Nebraska, but I said what about the other 49 states?"

The Democratic side of the House chamber erupted in cheers when the resolution passed.

"The Speaker continues to abdicate his responsibilities, ceding Congress's Article I authority to Donald Trump," Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a [statement posted to X](https://x.com/HouseForeign/status/2021423904246390936?s=20) on Tuesday. "Republicans now face a clear choice: go on the record and join Democrats in ending these cost-raising tariffs, or keep forcing American families to pay for them."

The measure now heads to the Senate, which approved similar resolutions last year.

"Congress has spoken with bipartisan clarity: it's time to give Americans relief and end Trump's tariff tax," said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. "This price-spiking tariff tax is raising costs on everything from groceries prices to energy bills — all because Trump chose chaos over common sense. It's time to deliver relief."

The vote on Trump's tariffs forced House Republicans to choose between loyalty to the president and striking down economic policy that many in the GOP conference do not like.

Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., and Don Bacon, R-Neb., bucked Trump and GOP leaders on Tuesday by voting with every Democrat to [defeat a rule](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/gop-tariffs-trump-house-johnson.html) that would have blocked House votes on Trump's tariffs through July 31.

"I don't like putting the important work of the House on pause, but Congress needs to be able to debate on tariffs. Tariffs have been a 'net negative' for the economy and are a significant tax that American consumers, manufacturers, and farmers are paying," [Bacon posted to X](https://x.com/RepDonBacon/status/2021418451911295376?s=20) after the Tuesday vote.

Because of the razor-thin GOP majority in the House, Johnson can afford to lose only one Republican vote if all Democrats are present and vote in favor of the resolution to end Trump's Canada tariff.

Still, the effort is likely symbolic. Even if the Senate approves Meeks' resolution, Trump would likely veto the legislation.

"This is life with a razor-thin majority," Johnson said in a Wednesday morning [appearance on Fox Business](https://x.com/atrupar/status/2021575438716297379?s=20). "I think it's a big mistake. I don't think we need to go down the road of trying to limit the president's power while he is in the midst of negotiating America-first trade agreements with nations around the world."
