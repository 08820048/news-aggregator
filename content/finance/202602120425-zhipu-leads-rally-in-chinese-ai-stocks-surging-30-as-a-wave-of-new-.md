Chinese artificial intelligence stocks rallied Thursday as several companies unveiled upgraded models and top policymakers renewed calls for a broader adoption of the technology.

Hong Kong-listed Zhipu AI — that trades as [Knowledge Atlas Technology](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/undefined/) — surged 30% after releasing its GLM-5, an open-source large-language model with enhanced coding capabilities and long-running agent tasks.

The company said the model [approaches Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/MVo6DIcGNje_YtLgVa4PaQ) in coding benchmarks while surpassing Google's Gemini 3 Pro on some tests. CNBC could not verify those claims.

[MiniMax](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/undefined/) saw shares in Hong Kong jump 11% following Wednesday's [launch of its updated M2.5](https://x.com/MiniMaxAgent/status/2021595954143515106?s=20) open-source model with enhanced AI agent tools, on its overseas website.

The company describes M2 as "a model built for Max coding & agentic workflows."

The rally comes amid intensifying competition in AI as Chinese developers race to match U.S. rivals with a flurry of new model and agent releases.

DeepSeek, which took the world by storm last year, also upgraded its flagship AI model on Wednesday, adding support for a larger context window and more up-to-date knowledge, according to a [report](https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3343225/deepseek-boosts-ai-model-10-fold-token-addition-zhipu-ai-gears-glm-5-launch) from the South China Morning Post.

Ant Group also released its open-source AI model, Ming-Flash-Omni 2.0, on Wednesday. The "unified multimodal model" is capable of generating speech, music, sound effects and visuals.

The releases also lifted investor sentiment on suppliers to AI companies. Shanghai-listed shares of UCloud Tech that provides computing support for Zhipu, surged by 20% to hit the daily limit.

SenseTime, which has shifted its focus from developing facial recognition surveillance technology to providing AI software platforms, saw its shares in Hong Kong jump 5%.

The Shanghai STAR AI Industry Index climbed 1.7% before paring gains.

Chinese Premier Li Qiang on Wednesday [called for a comprehensive push](https://www.cls.cn/detail/2287511) to implement AI "in diverse scenarios to unlock the potential of the technology."

The rally in AI startups comes amid a broader slump in Chinese tech giants that also have AI divisions. Shares of [Tencent](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/700-HK/) and [Alibaba](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/9988-HK/) fell 2.6% and 2.1%, respectively. The Hong Kong Hang Seng Tech index dropped 1.7%.
