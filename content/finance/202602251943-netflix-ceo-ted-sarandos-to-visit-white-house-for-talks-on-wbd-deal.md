[Netflix](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NFLX/) CEO [Ted Sarandos](https://www.cnbc.com/ted-sarandos-leaders-playbook/) will head to the White House on Thursday for meetings on his company's efforts to acquire part of [Warner Bros. Discovery](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WBD/) as [Paramount](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/24/warner-bros-discovery-paramount-higher-bid-netflix.html) ratchets up its rival bid, [Politico reported](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/25/netflix-sarandos-white-house-warner-00798285) Wednesday.

The reported visit is set to occur five days after President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/) demanded that Netflix [immediately fire](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116111073840858395) former Obama administration official Susan Rice from its board, or else "pay the consequences."

It was not immediately clear if Sarandos would be meeting with Trump during the visit, a person familiar with the discussions told Politico.

Netflix declined CNBC's request for comment on the report. The White House, asked by CNBC to confirm the visit, said, "We do not discuss private meetings that may or may not be happening."
