More than 900 [Google](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/) workers have signed an [open letter](https://www.googlers-against-ice.com/) condemning recent actions by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), urging the tech giant to disclose its dealings with the agencies and divest from them.

The letter, citing [recent ICE killings](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/29/trump-minnesota-ice-action-ceos-speaking-out.html) of Keith Porter, Renee Good, and Alex Pretti, said that the employees are "appalled by the violence" and "horrified" by Google's part in it.

"Google is powering this campaign of surveillance, violence, and repression," the letter reads.

It goes on to cite that Google Cloud is aiding CBP surveillance and powering [Palantir's](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PLTR/) ImmigrationOS system, which is used by ICE. The letter states that Google's generative artificial intelligence is used by CBP and that the Google Play Store has blocked ICE tracking apps.

The letter also quotes a social media post by Google Chief Scientist Jeff Dean from early January, who wrote, "We all bear a collective responsibility to speak up and not be silent when we see things like the events of the last week."

"We are vehemently opposed to Google's partnerships with DHS, CBP, and ICE," the employees wrote. "We consider it our leadership's ethical and policy-bound responsibility to disclose all contracts and collaboration with CBP and ICE, and to divest from these partnerships."

The letter calls on Google to acknowledge the danger that workers face from ICE, host an emergency internal Q&A on the company's DHS and military contracts, implement safety measures to protect workers — such as flexible work-from-home policies and immigration support — and reveal its ties with the government agencies to help all involved determine where the company will draw a line.

"As workers of conscience, we demand that our leadership end our backslide into contracting for governments enacting violence against civilians," the letter reads. "Google is now a prominent node in a shameful lineage of private companies profiting from violent state repression. We must use this moment to come together as a Googler community and demand an end to this disgraceful use of our labor."

Google did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.

The letter comes as employees place [mounting pressure on tech CEOs](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/26/alex-pretti-killing-ice-tech-ceo-response.html) to speak out against ICE. Just two weeks prior, employees representing [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/), [Spotify](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SPOT/), [Meta](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/) and more wrote a [similar letter](https://iceout.tech/) demanding ICE "out of our cities."
