LONDON — European stocks opened higher on Thursday as investors await another big batch of earnings reports.

The pan-European [Stoxx 600](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.STOXX/) was up almost 0.6% shortly after 8:00 a.m. in London (3:00 a.m. ET), with most sectors and major bourses in positive territory. The U.K.'s [FTSE](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.FTSE/) index advanced 0.38% in early trade, with Germany's [DAX](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.GDAXI/) opening 0.9% higher, as France's [CAC 40](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.FCHI/) gained 1.4% and Italy's [FTSE MIB](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.FTMIB/) was up 0.5%.

The positive open for regional bourses comes after markets closed mixed on Wednesday, as investors assessed [another flurry of corporate earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/europe-markets-stoxx-600-ftse-100-heineken-siemens-energy-earnings.html).

It's another busy day for earnings on Thursday with [Siemens](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SIE-DE/), [L'Oreal](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/OR-FR/), [Anheuser-Busch Inbev](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/), [British American Tobacco](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BATS-GB/), [Mercedes-Benz Group](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MBG-DE/), [Adyen](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ADYEN-NL/), and [Deutsche Borse](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DB1-DE/) among the companies reporting. U.K. fourth quarter GDP and industrial production figures are due on the data front.

In [Asia Pacific markets](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/12/asia-pacific-markets-nikkei-225-kospi-hang-seng-index.html) overnight, Japan's Nikkei 225 hit 58,000 for the first time in history, extending its post-election rally to fresh highs.

Meanwhile, [U.S. futures](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/stock-market-today-live-updates.html) tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were little changed Wednesday night after the blue-chip index's three-day win streak came to an end.
