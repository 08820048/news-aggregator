But the scheduling of her testimony comes amid growing concerns about her presence at a Fulton County, Georgia, elections center last month when FBI agents seized ballots from the 2020 election.Gabbard has said she was at the center at the direction of President Donald Trump.But Trump has said Gabbard was there at the "insistence" of Attorney General Pam Bondi.Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat who is vice chairman of the Intelligence committee, last week called on Gabbard to testify about her presence during the raid. Warner said he was particularly concerned that Gabbard had facilitated a phone call between Trump and FBI agents who were executing a search warrant.Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard speaks on the phone while standing at the edge of a truck loading bay after the FBI executed a search warrant for the Fulton County Election Hub and Operation Center in relation to the 2020 election, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the matter, in Union City, Georgia, Jan. 28, 2026.Elijah Nouvelage | Reuters"Let's be clear: It is inappropriate for a sitting president to personally involve himself in a criminal investigation tied to an election he lost," Warner told reporters last week.Warner and other Democratic lawmakers have warned that Trump may try to interfere in the 2026 congressional elections, where the president's fellow Republicans are at risk of losing their majority in the House.Trump, for years, has falsely claimed he won the 2020 presidential election. Trump lost that election to former President Joe Biden, who defeated him in Georgia, as well as in other states.A federal judge in Georgia over the weekend ordered that the affidavit filed to obtain the search warrant for the FBI raid be unsealed by Tuesday.Disclosure: CNBC and MS NOW are divisions of Versant Media.
