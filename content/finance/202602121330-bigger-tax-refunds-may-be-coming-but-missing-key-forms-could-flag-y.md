With many expecting a [bigger tax refund](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/30/tax-refunds.html) this season, there may be an incentive to [file returns](https://www.cnbc.com/taxes/) sooner. But that doesn't mean you should rush to send yours.

First, you'll need all the [necessary tax forms](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/tax-return-audit-key-tax-forms.html), or you could risk [processing delays](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/irs-tax-season-2026.html) — or worse, experts say.  

Every year, employers and financial institutions report your income and other transactions via so-called [information returns](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/a-guide-to-information-returns), such as W-2s and 1099s. A copy goes to you and to the IRS, which makes it easy for the agency's systems to automatically flag missing or incorrect details, experts say.       

"We don't know all the things that [make an IRS audit happen](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/15/irs-audit-red-flags.html)," said April Walker, senior manager for tax practice and ethics with the American Institute of CPAs. "But one of the best ways to avoid that is to make sure that you are fully and completely reporting everything."

If you have an error or leave details off your return, you could see an automated [CP 2000 notice](https://www.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/notices/cp-2000/) from the IRS, which details what is missing, based on information returns the agency received. The notice also includes the IRS' [proposed adjustments](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc652), with an opportunity to agree or disagree with the changes.

Some filers could see an "accuracy-related penalty" for missing income, but mistakes won't necessarily trigger an audit, according to Josh Youngblood, owner of The Youngblood Group, a Dallas-based tax firm. He is also an enrolled agent, which is a tax license to practice before the IRS.

The 2026 filing season could [present "greater challenges"](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/irs-tax-season-2026.html) for certain taxpayers amid the IRS' [27% workforce reduction](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/23/smaller-irs-budget-cuts-impact-2026-tax-season.html), leadership turnover and implementation of tax changes enacted by President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/), the National Taxpayer Advocate said in a late January [report to Congress](https://www.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/reports/2025-annual-report-to-congress/). 

With possible taxpayer service delays this season, it's important to file your returns accurately the first time, experts say.

## When to expect tax forms

While many tax forms come in late January, others could take until mid-February, March or even later, according to the AICPA. 

For example, 1099s for your investments are typically among the last to arrive, especially for more complicated assets, Walker said. In some cases, the first form you receive from financial institutions states that a corrected version will come later.

For earnings, you can expect Forms [W-2](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-2) for wages, [1099-NEC](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-nec) for contract work, [1099-G](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-g) for unemployment income, [1099-R](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-r) for retirement plan distributions and others.

If you're claiming [new deductions](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/03/trump-big-beautiful-bill-tax-changes.html) for tip or overtime income for 2025, your employer may or [may not report those figures](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/25/irs-guidance-trump-tips-overtime-deductions.html) on your W-2 or 1099 this season. That means you'll need to calculate qualified income for these tax breaks on your own.

Also, some filers will see [Form 1099-DA](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-da) for the first time in 2026. It covers last year's digital asset transactions.

Other forms can help filers claim tax credits and deductions.

Certain "above-the-line" deductions allow tax breaks even when using the standard deduction. The forms for these may include a [1098-E](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1098-e) for student loan interest, [5498](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-5498) for individual retirement account contributions or [5498-SA](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-5498-sa) for health savings account deposits.
