Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.cnbc.com/vladimir-putin/) has sharply criticized the [Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/) administration's fuel blockade on Cuba, saying Moscow considers the latest restrictions unacceptable.

His comments come as the island nation grapples with a [worsening economic crisis](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/09/cuba-airlines-fuel-energy-oil-us-trump-pressure.html), one that has been compared to its [biggest test since the collapse of the Soviet Union](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/14/cuba-fuel-shortage-trump-tariffs.html).

"This is a special period, with new sanctions. You know how we feel about this. We do not accept anything like this," Putin said on Wednesday during a meeting with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, [according](https://tass.com/politics/2088631) to Russian news agency Tass.

Russia, which has been allied to Cuba for decades, has recently described Havana's fuel situation as "truly critical" and said it is actively discussing what help it can provide to the country.

"We have always been on Cuba's side in its struggle for independence, for the right to follow its own path of development, and we have always supported the Cuban people," Putin said.

"We know how difficult these past decades have been for the Cuban people as they have fought for the right to live by their own rules and defend their national interests," he added.

The White House has said it was in Cuba's interest to make big changes soon, although stopped short of calling for a change of government.

"They are a regime that is falling. Their country is collapsing and that's why we believe it's in their best interest to make very dramatic changes very soon," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Wednesday.
