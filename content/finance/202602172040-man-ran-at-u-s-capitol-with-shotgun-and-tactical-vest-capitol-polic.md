A man carrying a shotgun and wearing a "tactical vest" on Tuesday got out of a car and ran toward the U.S. Capitol before being stopped by police officers stationed outside the building, law enforcement said.

Officers drew their guns and ordered the man to drop the weapon, and he complied, U.S. Capitol Police Chief Michael Sullivan [told reporters](https://www.youtube.com/live/rlHfm8Wg4CY) Tuesday afternoon. The man, who was also wearing "tactical gloves," then laid down on the ground and was taken into custody, Sullivan said.

When officers looked in the white Mercedes SUV from which the man had emerged, they found "a Kevlar helmet and a gas mask in the vehicle," according to Sullivan.

The man's shotgun was loaded, and he was carrying additional rounds, the police chief said.

Police did not immediately share the suspect's identity, but Sullivan described him as an 18-year-old who does not live in the area.

The vehicle was not registered to the man, and police are looking at multiple addresses to "chase out where he actually came from," Sullivan said.

No motive is known at this time, Sullivan told the press.

The chief commended the officers who apprehended the suspect, adding this is why police at the Capitol conduct monthly active-shooter exercises.

"Who knows what could have happened if we wouldn't have officers here standing guard like they do every single day," he said.
