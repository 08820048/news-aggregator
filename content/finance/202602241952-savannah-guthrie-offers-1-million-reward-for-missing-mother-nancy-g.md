[Savannah Guthrie](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/mother-of-savannah-guthrie-today-reported-missing-arizona-rcna257008), in an emotional [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DVJKU2wADV3/?igsh=MnNnbGU4ZXY1M3A4) Tuesday morning, said her family is offering a reward of up to $1 million for "any information" that would lead to the recovery of her missing mother, [Nancy Guthrie](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/suspect-in-nancy-guthries-abduction-detained-in-arizona-law-enforcement-official-says-reuters.html), who vanished from her Arizona home after last being seen entering it the night of Jan. 31.

"Help us bring our beloved mother home," Savannah Guthrie, a co-anchor of NBC's "TODAY" show, said in the video post. "Please be the light in the dark."

"We need her to come home."

Guthrie acknowledged her 84-year-old mother, who is believed to have been abducted from her Tucson home, may not be alive, given the time that has passed, her age and her medical issues.

"We know that millions of you have been praying. So many people have been praying, of every faith and no faith at all, praying for her return, and we feel those prayers," Guthrie said.

"We still believe that she can come home, hope against hope, as my sister says," Guthrie said. "We are blowing on the embers of hope. We also know that she may be lost, she may already be gone."

"She may have already gone home to the Lord that she loves and is dancing in heaven with her mom and her dad and with her beloved brother Pierce and with our daddy," Guthrie said. "If this is what is to be, then we will accept it. But we need to know where she is."

The Pima County Sheriff's Department has said that it believes Nancy Guthrie was "taken from the home against her will, possibly in the middle of the night, and that includes possible kidnapping or abduction."

FBI Director Kash Patel, in a Feb. 10 post on X, made public photos and video showing a masked man, who was wearing gloves, approaching Nancy Guthrie's front door hours after she was dropped off at home. The images were captured from a camera on the front of the house.

Despite that video and other investigative efforts, authorities remain at a loss in their effort to find Nancy Guthrie.

In her Instagram post on Tuesday, Savannah Guthrie spoke as if she were talking directly to a person who might know where Nancy is.

"It is day 24 since our mom was taken in the dark of night from her bed," she said. "And we are begging you to come forward now."

Guthrie also said that her family knows that there are millions other families who "have suffered with this kind of uncertainty" about a missing loved one.

For that reason, she said, "We also are donating $500,000 to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children for their work and helping families who are coping with loss and actively looking for those who are lost."

The FBI's [X account](https://x.com/FBIPhoenix/status/2026296993211994352?s=20) on Tuesday posted details of the $1 million reward offer from Guthrie's family.

"The FBI's $100,000 reward also remains active," that post said.
