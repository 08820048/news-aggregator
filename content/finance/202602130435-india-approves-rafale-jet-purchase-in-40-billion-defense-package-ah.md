India approved the purchase of Rafale fighter jets from France on Thursday, marking one of its largest aircraft orders, ahead of French President [Emmanuel Macron](https://www.cnbc.com/emmanuel-macron/)'s visit to the country.

The approval was part of New Delhi's [3.6 trillion rupee ($39.7 billion) defence spending package](https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2227018&amp;reg=3&amp;lang=2) covering multiple acquisitions across the armed forces.

The Defence Ministry did not specify how many aircraft would be ordered. [Local media reported](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indian-air-force-iaf-rafale-purchase-of-114-rafales-indias-biggest-military-buy-clears-major-hurdle-10994076) that India will purchase 114 Rafale jets, with 18 supplied by manufacturer [Dassault](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AM-FR/) and the remaining 96 manufactured domestically.

The broader package includes Boeing P8I Poseidon reconnaissance aircraft for its navy, anti-tank mines for its ground forces, and upgrades to its Soviet-era T-72 tanks and BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicles.

The new aircraft are expected to help address a shortfall in the Indian air force, which operates 29 squadrons against a minimum requirement of 42, according to a 2024 parliamentary report.

The air force most recently [retired two squadrons](https://www.facebook.com/reel/1743323369718394/) of Cold War-era MiG-21 fighters in September 2025, and is expected to [phase out](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-race-for-fighters-the-iafs-dilemma/article69049922.ece) additional aircraft in the coming years.

The Rafale purchase follows another order in April for [26 Rafale-Marine fighters](https://www.dassault-aviation.com/en/group/press/press-kits/signature-of-the-rafale-marine-contract-for-india/) for India's Navy. Dassault said India would become the first user outside France to operate this variant.

Rafale jets were used by the Indian Air Force during its 2025 conflict with Pakistan, when at least one aircraft [was reported lost in combat](https://www.reuters.com/world/pakistans-chinese-made-jet-brought-down-two-indian-fighter-aircraft-us-officials-2025-05-08/) against Islamabad's Chinese-made J-10Cs.

Macron, who will be in India from Feb. 17 to 19, is scheduled to meet Indian Prime Minister [Narendra Modi](https://www.cnbc.com/narendra-modi/) to discuss expanding bilateral cooperation across sectors.

The two leaders will also launch the India-France Year of Innovation and attend the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, according to [India's external affairs ministry](https://www.mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/40727/Visit_of_the_French_President_to_India_February_1719_2026).

"The leaders will discuss regional and global issues of mutual interest, including cooperation in the Indo-Pacific," the release added.
