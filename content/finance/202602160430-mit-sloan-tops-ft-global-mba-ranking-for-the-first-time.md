MIT Sloan School of Management in the US has topped the FT’s 2026 [Global MBA Ranking](https://rankings.ft.com/rankings/3006/mba-2026) for the first time, beating contenders including Insead, based in France and Singapore, and the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.

The recognition for MIT, up several places in the [ranking](https://rankings.ft.com/rankings/3006/mba-2026) from previous years, comes at a time of sharpening focus from students on the importance of technology, including [artificial intelligence](https://www.ft.com/content/3659b953-8a3a-4e13-b322-c973a545b836), as they prepare for disruptions in the workplace.

Richard Locke, the recently appointed dean of the Massachusetts school, says that Sloan is forging tight links with other parts of MIT, which is renowned for its engineering and science expertise, and focusing more on how AI could be used “as a tool not to replace jobs but enhance them”. He adds: “We are exploring how we reinvent management education for the 21st century.”

MIT Sloan, Insead and Wharton were followed in the top tier of eight by Iese in Spain, London Business School, HEC Paris, Spanish school Esade and Ceibs in China.

See the 2026 MBA [ranking](https://rankings.ft.com/rankings/3006/mba-2026) and [report](https://www.ft.com/mba)

The [ranking](https://rankings.ft.com/rankings/3006/mba-2026) comes at a time of intensifying debate about the cost and [value](https://www.ft.com/content/95aafafa-0614-4807-ae9e-06865b9d10ce) of MBAs, with the [FT’s latest data](https://www.ft.com/content/a5c945cb-39eb-4526-ba0b-e5b4f5d68e5f) showing that inflation-adjusted salaries outside the US and Canada have fallen over the past decade, although the real cost of the degree has also dropped in that time. And some graduates of even the leading business schools have had difficulty finding employment in the past year, in a patchy jobs market.

However, in a separate [survey](https://www.ft.com/content/7f7c30cc-795e-4f16-b78e-a801ae6a322e) of 1,152 alumni of all ages from multiple business schools globally, 83 per cent said they rated their MBA or executive MBA “highly” or “very highly”. This additional survey was conducted by the FT in conjunction with ZHAW School of Management and Law in Switzerland and Beta Gamma Sigma, an honours society for high-scoring students. MBA and EMBA graduate satisfaction was greater than that of alumni of business undergraduate or pre-experience masters programmes.

The FT Global MBA Ranking assesses business schools — which choose to participate in the process — on factors including alumni salary three years after completing the course and salary increase from before the programme to now.

MIT Sloan dean Richard Locke says the school is focused on the future impact of AI

The ranking also considers faculty research output, graduate feedback on the careers service and how far alumni had achieved their aims during their studies. All of the top 100 institutions that are ranked are accredited by either the US-based AACSB or Europe’s Equis. 

[MIT](https://rankings.ft.com/schools/150/mit-sloan/programme-portfolio) alumni reported the third-highest average salaries three years after completing their MBA at $245,991, behind [Harvard Business School](https://rankings.ft.com/schools/125/harvard-business-school/programme-portfolio) at $259,874 and [Wharton](https://rankings.ft.com/schools/200/university-of-pennsylvania-wharton/programme-portfolio) at $246,813, weighted for variations between sectors and adjusted for international purchasing power parity. 

The [Indian School of Business](https://rankings.ft.com/schools/424/indian-school-of-business/school-info) reported the highest salary increase compared with earnings before the degree, up 248 per cent to $201,712. The schools rated highest for value for money were [University of Georgia: Terry](https://rankings.ft.com/schools/190/university-of-georgia-terry/school-info) in the US, followed by [Nanyang Business School, NTU](https://rankings.ft.com/schools/231/nanyang-business-school/programme-portfolio) in Singapore.

Wharton came top in the research rank for faculty publications in leading academic journals, followed by Harvard, [University of Chicago: Booth](https://rankings.ft.com/schools/188/university-of-chicago-gsb/programme-portfolio), [Insead](https://rankings.ft.com/schools/135/insead/programme-portfolio) and [London Business School](https://rankings.ft.com/schools/141/london-business-school/programme-portfolio).
