OpenAI CEO [Sam Altman](https://www.cnbc.com/sam-altman/) said Sunday that the creator of the viral AI agent OpenClaw is joining the company, and that the service will "live in a foundation as an open source project that OpenAI will continue to support."

Previously called Clawdbot and Moltbot, OpenClaw was launched last month by Austrian software developer Peter Steinberger. It's [surged in popularity](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/02/openclaw-open-source-ai-agent-rise-controversy-clawdbot-moltbot-moltbook.html), due in part to attention on social media, as consumers and businesses swarm to products that can autonomously complete tasks, make decisions, and take actions on behalf of users without constant human guidance.

In a [post on X](https://x.com/sama/status/2023150230905159801), Altman wrote that Steinberger is "joining OpenAI to drive the next generation of personal agents."

"He is a genius with a lot of amazing ideas about the future of very smart agents interacting with each other to do very useful things for people," Altman wrote. "We expect this will quickly become core to our product offerings."

No terms were disclosed, but AI companies, including OpenAI, have been throwing open their wallets to hire top AI talent. In May, OpenAI [acquired](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/21/openai-buys-iphone-designer-jony-ive-device-startup-for-6point4-billion.html) iPhone designer Jony Ive's AI devices startup io for over $6 billion. [Meta](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/) and [Google](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/) have also been spending billions to bring in AI developers and researchers.

OpenAI, which was most recently valued at $500 billion and is now looking to boost that number, faces intense competition in the generative AI market, particularly from Google and Anthropic, whose AI models are being used by enterprises to take over more business tasks.

Anthropic's Claude has been getting particular traction of late thanks to Claude Code, and the company recently introduced [Claude Opus 4.6](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/05/anthropic-claude-opus-4-6-vibe-working.html), which is better at coding, sustaining tasks for longer and creating higher-quality professional work, the company said.

Anthropic was valued at $380 billion in a fundraising round that closed earlier in the week.

OpenClaw has spread quickly in China and can be paired with Chinese-developed language models, such as DeepSeek, and configured to work with Chinese messaging apps through customized setups. Chinese search engine [Baidu](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BIDU/) plans to give users of its main smartphone app direct access to OpenClaw, a spokesperson [told](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/13/baidu-openclaw-ai-search-app-integration-china-lunar-new-year.html) CNBC.

Some researchers are [concerned](https://fortune.com/2026/02/12/openclaw-ai-agents-security-risks-beware/) about the openness of OpenClaw, and the cyberthreats potentially posed by users' ability to tweak it in just about anyway they see fit.
