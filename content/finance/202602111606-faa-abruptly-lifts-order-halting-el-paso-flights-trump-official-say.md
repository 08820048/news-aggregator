The Federal Aviation Administration abruptly grounded all flights in and out of El Paso International Airport in Texas for 10 days starting Wednesday morning, citing "special security" instructions — and then lifted the order hours later.

A Trump administration official said the Department of Defense disabled Mexican cartel drones that had breached U.S. airspace and that there was no threat to commercial air travel currently.

"The temporary closure of airspace over El Paso has been lifted," the FAA said in a post on X. "There is no threat to commercial aviation. All flights will resume as normal."

The airport sits next to Biggs Army Airfield and is near the Mexican border, about 12 miles from Juarez, Mexico. The Pentagon referred a question about the nature of the security issue to the FAA.

Flights were initially halted until late Feb. 20 and the ban applied to a 10-nautical-mile area around the airport. The FAA hadn't immediately disclosed what the security reasons for the temporary sudden halt were or why it was set for so long.

While the FAA regularly halts flights at airports for weather, traffic or even [rocket launches](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/06/faa-halts-flights-florida-airports-spacex-starsship-testing-failure.html), a security issue is highly unusual, as is announcing such a long effective airspace closure.

U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Texas Democrat whose district includes much of El Paso, said the move to suddenly close airspace was "unprecedented."

"There was no advance notice provided to my office, the City of El Paso, or anyone involved in airport operations," she said in a statement.

Southwest has 23 flights scheduled at the airport Wednesday, out of more than 3,000 systemwide. The airline said Wednesday it is resuming operations to and from El Paso and encouraged travelers to check its website for updated information.

"Nothing is more important to Southwest than the Safety of its Customers and Employees," it said.

United said it didn't cancel any flights and that it canceled an earlier travel waiver.
