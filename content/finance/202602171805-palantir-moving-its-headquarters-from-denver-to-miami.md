[Palantir](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PLTR/) is relocating its headquarters to Miami from [Denver](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/26/palantir-makes-denver-the-city-to-watch-amid-silicon-valleys-exodus.html), the company announced Tuesday in a [post](https://x.com/PalantirTech/status/2023780511051809010) to social media platform X.

The software analytics firm is the latest big business to migrate to South Florida as executives seek to transform the region into a hub for innovation.

Florida, which offers a friendlier tax environment, has [welcomed a wave of billionaires](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/08/california-wealth-tax-proposal-leaves-billionaires-with-little-way-out.html) in recent years. The region is also gaining more executives as California deliberates over a [5% wealth tax](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/20/california-billionaire-tax-faces-uphill-battle-new-poll-finds.html) on residents with a net worth exceeding $1 billion.

[Meta Platforms](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/) CEO [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.cnbc.com/mark-zuckerberg/) has reportedly bought a mansion in Florida and Palantir co-founder [Peter Thiel](https://www.cnbc.com/peter-thiel/) has established a base in Miami.

Palantir, which was founded in Palo Alto, California in 2003, previously [moved](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/19/palantir-headquarters-moves-from-silicon-valley-to-colorado.html) to Denver in 2020. CEO Alex Karp has previously spoken out about the [culture in Silicon Valley](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/25/palantir-ceo-rips-silicon-valley-in-letter-to-investors.html).

"Our company was founded in Silicon Valley," he wrote in a [letter in 2020](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406_9). "But we seem to share fewer and fewer of the technology sector's values and commitments."

Major tech companies are also building bigger hubs in the region. [ServiceNow](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NOW/) said in September it would [add more office space](https://newsroom.servicenow.com/press-releases/details/2025/ServiceNow-Expands-Global-Presence-in-Fast-Growing-West-Palm-Beach-to-Drive-AI-Innovation-Talent-Development-and-Economic-Growth/default.aspx) in West Palm Beach. [Ken Griffin](https://www.cnbc.com/ken-griffin/)\-run hedge fund Citadel is also based out of Miami.

At the end of [last year](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001321655/000132165526000011/pltr-20251231.htm), Palantir said it had 4,429 full-time workers, with significant offices in Palo Alto, New York City, Washington, D.C. and London.

Palantir also [leases space](https://www.palantir.com/contact/) in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, according to its website.
