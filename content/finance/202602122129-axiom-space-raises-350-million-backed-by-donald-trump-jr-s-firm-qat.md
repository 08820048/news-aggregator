[Axiom Space](https://www.axiomspace.com/), which provides suits for NASA's moon missions and is building a successor to the International Space Station, has raised $350 million, the company said Thursday.

Both the [Qatar sovereign wealth fund](https://www.qia.qa/en/pages/default.aspx) and Type One Ventures led the round, with participation from Hungary-based IT company [4iG](https://www.4ig.hu/home) and [1789 Capital](https://1789capital.vc/), where [Donald Trump Jr.](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump-jr/) is a partner.

CEO Jonathan Cirtain told reporters on Thursday that Axiom Space, which is valued at more than $2.5 billion according to Pitchbook, plans to use the funding on spacesuit capabilities and modules one and two for its commercial space station.

"This financing reflects continued strong institutional and strategic investor conviction in Axiom Space's leadership position," said Cirtain, who [took the helm](https://www.axiomspace.com/release/jonathan-cirtain-ceo) of the company in October.

The company's latest funding round arrives during a critical time for space technology. More investors have [flocked to the sector](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/22/firefly-rocket-lab-intuitive-machines-stock.html) as excitement builds into [SpaceX](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/03/musk-xai-spacex-biggest-merger-ever.html)'s potential mammoth [IPO](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/02/elon-musk-spacex-xai-ipo.html) later this year.

Efforts by [President Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/) to [re-industrialize U.S. defense systems](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/31/space-and-defense-boom-lifted-these-satellite-stocks-by-200percent-in-2025.html) and return U.S. astronauts to the moon for the first time in 50 years have also fueled enthusiasm.

Over the years, Axiom Space has worked closely with SpaceX to launch both private and government astronauts to the ISS, ahead of its [2030 retirement](https://www.nasa.gov/faqs-the-international-space-station-transition-plan/).

Last month, NASA awarded the Houston-based company its [fifth private astronaut mission](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-selects-axiom-space-for-fifth-private-mission-to-space-station/), slated to launch as soon as January 2027.

NASA is emerging from a messy transition period following Trump's 2024 election victory during which the agency saw a leadership shakeup and faced dramatic workforce cuts.

[Jared Isaacman](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/17/senate-confirms-private-astronaut-musk-ally-jared-isaacman-as-nasa-chief.html), an [Elon Musk](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/) ally, was finally appointed to lead the agency in December, more than a year after the president [first nominated him](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/trump-nominates-jared-isaacman-for-nasa-administrator.html) to the role. The president previously revoked his nomination for Isaacman due to concerns over his political affiliations.

In the interim, Transportation Secretary [Sean Duffy](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/09/transport-secretary-duffy-to-be-interim-nasa-administrator-trump-says.html) temporarily oversaw NASA. Duffy faced [harsh criticism](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/elon-musk-slams-tran.html) from Musk in October after the transportation chief told news outlets that SpaceX was [behind on its U.S. moon missions](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/20/nasa-duffy-spacex-artemis-moon-landing.html) and that NASA would consider other contracts.

NASA's Artemis missions have also hit some snags. In 2024, the agency [pushed back launches](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-shares-orion-heat-shield-findings-updates-artemis-moon-missions/) for its [2026 and 2027 moon trips](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/05/nasa-announces-further-delays-artemis-moon-missions.html) due to safety and technical concerns. One of those problems included issues with the spacesuits.

Cirtain said Thursday that the company is "currently on schedule" to deliver its spacesuits to NASA by 2027.

"We're taking a multifaceted approach to making sure that development is completed on time," he said.

Axiom Space did not disclose the valuation at which it raised funds.
