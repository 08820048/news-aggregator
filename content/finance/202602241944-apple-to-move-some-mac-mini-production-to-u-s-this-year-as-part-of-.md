[Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/) said it's [moving](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/02/apple-accelerates-us-manufacturing-with-mac-mini-production/) production of some of its Mac Mini computers to the U.S. later this year as the company seeks to bolster domestic manufacturing.

The iPhone maker last year unveiled plans to invest $600 billion in the U.S., with CEO [Tim Cook](https://www.cnbc.com/tim-cook/) [appearing](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/07/apples-tim-cook-convinced-trump-to-drop-made-in-usa-iphone-for-now.html) at the White House with [President Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/10/19/president-trump-bashes-fauci.html) in August for the announcement of a $100 billion outlay. The company also has said it will purchase parts and expand its relationship with U.S. suppliers.

"As part of our $600B commitment, Mac mini will be produced in the US for the first time later this year!" Cook wrote in a [post on X](https://x.com/tim_cook/status/2026351829928624257) on Tuesday. "We're accelerating our progress even further — producing more AI servers and opening an all-new Apple Advanced Manufacturing Center for hands-on training."

The Mac Mini is Apple's compact, more affordable desktop computer, which start at about $600, according to the company's [website](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/mac-mini). Later this year, production will begin at a new factory in Houston, where Apple started producing AI servers last year, the company said in a [statement](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/02/apple-accelerates-us-manufacturing-with-mac-mini-production/).

"We began shipping advanced AI servers from Houston ahead of schedule, and we're excited to accelerate that work even further," Cook said in the release.

Apple has been [hit hard](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/20/supreme-court-tariff-decision-apple-trump-cook-iphone.html) by tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, paying about $3.3 billion since the president initiated the levies last year. Apple is sourcing half of its iPhones for the U.S. from [India](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/01/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q2-2025-.html) and most of its other U.S.-bound products like Macs, AirPods and watches from Vietnam.

The Supreme Court on Friday [struck down](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/20/supreme-court-trump-tariffs-ruling.html) a large chunk of President Trump's far-reaching [tariff](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/19/supreme-court-tariff-ruling.html) agenda, but uncertainty remains after Trump rebuked the decision.

Apple said its 20,000-square-foot advanced manufacturing center in Houston will open its doors later this year. The company said it will provide training in advanced manufacturing techniques to students, supplier employees, and American businesses, teaching them "the same innovative processes that are used to make Apple products."
