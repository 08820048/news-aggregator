The Seahawks may have won the [Super Bowl](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/nearly-125-million-watch-seahawks-crush-patriots-in-super-bowl-lx.html), but [Anthropic](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/12/anthropic-closes-30-billion-funding-round-at-380-billion-valuation.html) also walked away with bragging rights, according to data analyzed by BNP Paribas.

The maker of the Claude chatbot saw visits to its site jump 6.5% following its Super Bowl advertisement that took a swing at rival OpenAI's decision to bring [ads to ChatGPT](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/16/open-ai-chatgpt-ads-us.html).

The Claude gain, which took it into the top 10 free apps on the Apple App Store, beat out chatbot and [artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/ai-effect/) competitors [OpenAI](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/06/openai-altman-nvidia-musk-anthropic-super-bowl.html), [Google](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/) Gemini and [Meta](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/). Daily active users also saw an 11% jump post-game, the most significant within the firm's AI coverage.

OpenAI's ChatGPT had a 2.7% bump in daily active users after the Super Bowl and Gemini added 1.4%.

Claude's user base is still much smaller than ChatGPT and Gemini.

Advertisements from [artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/ai-effect/) brands took center stage at the big game, which brought in an audience of 125 million in the U.S., as platforms made their pitch to lure more customers in a competitive market that's showing no signs of slowing.

The high-stakes rivalry between OpenAI and Anthropic added a new layer with the duelling ads as the AI labs head toward [potential IPOs](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/06/space-x-openai-and-anthropic-could-ipo-this-year-but-is-it-willing-to-pay.html) later in the year.

Both companies have also gotten more vocal in public in recent weeks, with executives [openly criticizing](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/anthropic-vs-openai-ads-spending-criticism.html) each other's businesses.

OpenAI CEO [Sam Altman](https://www.cnbc.com/sam-altman/) attacked Anthropic's Super Bowl [ad campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmnjDLwZckA). In a [post](https://x.com/sama/status/2019139174339928189?s=20) to social media platform X, Altman called the commercials "deceptive" and "clearly dishonest."

Both Anthropic and OpenAI are also fiercely competing to win over enterprises and the best coding talent, while raising record amounts of private funding.

This week, Anthropic closed a $30 billion funding round at a $380 billion post-money valuation, more than twice its valuation at the time of its September raise.

But OpenAI leads the pack with the largest ever private tech fundraising round, which it [set last year](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/01/openai-raise-chatgpt-users.html). The company is also in talks to wrap what could be a [$100 billion funding round](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/09/sam-altman-touts-chatgpt-growth-as-openai-nears-100-billion-funding.html), CNBC previously reported.
