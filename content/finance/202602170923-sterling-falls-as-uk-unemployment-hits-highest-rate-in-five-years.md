LONDON — Sterling dipped and British government bond yields fell Tuesday morning after data showed the UK's unemployment rate rose to a five-year high while wage growth slowed.

The pan-European [Stoxx 600](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.STOXX/) hovered above the flatline as of 9:17 a.m. GMT (4:17 a.m. ET), with Italy's [FTSE MIB](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.FTMIB/) also adding nearly 0.4%. France's [CAC 40](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.FCHI/) rose nearly 0.2%, and Germany's [DAX](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.GDAXI/) was up 0.1%.

The UK's [FTSE 100](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.FTSE/) was up nearly 0.5% shortly after the market opened. [Sterling](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GBP=/) fell against the dollar, last down 0.2% to trade at $1.359, after the UK's [earnings and employment report](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/earningsandemploymentfrompayasyouearnrealtimeinformationuk/february2026) showed that the number of payrolled workers fell 0.4% on a yearly basis to 30.3 million in January 2026.

That's 134,000 fewer employees since January 2025 and down 11,000 from the previous month. Meanwhile, the [unemployment rate](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/uklabourmarket/february2026) rose to 5.2% in December, up from 5.1% a month earlier. The pound was last down 0.2% against the [Euro](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/EURGBP=/).

UK unemployment is now at its "highest level" since January 2021, hitting a five-year high, Samuel Fuller, director of Financial Markets Online, said.

British government bond yields, known as gilts, were down following the release of the jobs data. The [10-year Gilt](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UK10Y-GB/) was down 3 basis points to 4.368%, while the [2-year Gilt](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UK2Y-GB/) shed 2 basis points to 3.563%.

Bank of England futures are now fully pricing two cuts this year, with a 75% chance of a cut next month after the release of the unemployment figures.

"With Britain's economy almost flatlining and the labour market weakening, falling inflation will be the final piece of the puzzle needed for the Bank's ratesetting committee to pull the monetary stimulus lever," Fuller added.
