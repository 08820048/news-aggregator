Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger will deliver the Democratic rebuttal to President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/)'s State of the Union address next Tuesday, a primetime slot for the newly elected state executive to lay out the [Democratic](https://www.cnbc.com/democrats/) Party's vision ahead of the pivotal 2026 [midterm elections](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/18/trump-elections-save-act-congress-voter-id.html).

Spanberger defeated Republican [Winsome Earl-Sears](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2025-elections/virginia-governor-results) by 15 points in last year's elections, flipping the state from Republican to Democratic control. She was previously a member of the House of Representatives from Virginia.

The rebuttal to the State of the Union is a high-stakes opportunity for the party outside of the [White House](https://www.cnbc.com/white-house/) to lay out its vision for the country after the president gives his speech. The stakes are even higher for Democrats this year, who are looking to rip away Trump's complete control of Washington in the midterm elections.

"Virginians and Americans across the country are contending with rising costs, chaos in their communities, and a real fear of what each day might bring," Spanberger said in a statement announcing her speech. "Next week, I look forward to laying out what these Americans expect and deserve — leaders who are working hard to deliver for them."

House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said in a statement that Spanberger "stands in stark contrast to Donald Trump, who will lie, deflect and blame everyone but himself for his failed presidency on Tuesday evening."

And Senate Minority Leader [Chuck Schume](https://www.cnbc.com/chuck-schumer/)r, D-N.Y., said she will "lay out a clear path forward: lower everyday costs, protect healthcare, and defend the freedoms that define who we are as a nation."

Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., gave the rebuttal to Trump's joint session of Congress last year. The last time a [governor gave the rebuttal](https://www.senate.gov/about/traditions-symbols/state-of-the-union-response-list.htm) was in 2022 when Republican Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds spoke following President Joe Biden's State of the Union address.
