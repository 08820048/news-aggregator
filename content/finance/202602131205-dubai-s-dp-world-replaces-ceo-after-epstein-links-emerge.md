The CEO of Dubai's largest port has been replaced by the company after details of his past relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were made public.

On Friday, DP World announced in a [statement](https://www.mediaoffice.ae/en/news/2026/february/13-02/dp-world-announces-new-leadership-appointments) that it had appointed Essa Kazim as chairman of its board of directors and Yuvraj Narayan as group Chief Executive Officer, replacing Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem.

The U.S. Department of Justice's latest release of files related to Epstein revealed that the financier once referred to Sulayem as a "[close personal friend](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01155800.pdf)" and called him [one of his most trusted friends](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00962669.pdf) in other files.

Sulayem was at the helm of Dubai's largest port operator as chairman since 2007 and CEO since 2016.

The statement made no mention of Sulayem but said the company "affirmed that the new appointments support its strategy for sustainable growth and reinforce its role in strengthening global supply chains and supporting Dubai's position as a leading hub for trade and logistics."

CNBC sought comment from Sulayem through DP World, where he serves as chairman and CEO, but did not receive a response."
