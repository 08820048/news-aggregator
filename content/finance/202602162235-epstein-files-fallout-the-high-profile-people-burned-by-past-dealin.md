The recent release by the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/epstein) of millions of pages of emails and other documents related to the notorious sex predator [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/12/trump-jeffrey-epstein-ghislaine-maxwell-emails-house-democrats.html) has led to a wave of resignations and other uncomfortable fallout for high-profile people around the world whose dealings with him have been exposed.

Those individuals include the top lawyer at the major investment bank [Goldman Sachs](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GS/), the CEO of [Dubai](https://www.cnbc.com/id/10000544)'s largest port, a former president of Harvard University, a former U.S. president and ex-secretary of State, and the chairman of a [leading American corporate law firm](https://www.paulweiss.com/).

The fallout from the Epstein files and people mentioned in them has even imperiled the government of [United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/uk-keir-starmer-peter-mandelson-labour-epstein-files-politics.html), even though the Labour Party leader never knew the convicted sex offender.

Epstein, who cultivated relationships with many rich and powerful men and women, pleaded guilty in 2008 in Florida to state criminal charges related to soliciting prostitution, with one charge related to a girl under the age of 18.

He ended up serving 13 months in prison in that case, but was allowed to go to his office many days for work.

In August 2019, Epstein killed himself in a jail in New York City, weeks after being arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges.

A number of the people who have resigned their jobs in recent weeks had friendly dealings with Epstein after his 2008 conviction, which was widely publicized at the time.

Being mentioned in the Epstein files does not mean that someone was implicated in any of the crimes that he previously pleaded guilty to, or was later charged with. No one on the list of names compiled by CNBC of those affected by their association with Epstein has been charged for such conduct.

Here are some high-profile figures who have been burned by their appearances in the Epstein files:

Pritzker said he would step down as chair effective immediately on Feb. 16 after holding the position for more than two decades. The 75-year-old billionaire also said he would not seek reelection to the board at the annual stockholder meeting. Recently released files show Pritzker and Epstein exchanged friendly emails after the latter's 2008 plea deal. Pritzker said he "exercised terrible judgment in maintaining contact" with Epstein and that there was "no excuse for failing to distance myself sooner."

[**Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem**](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/13/dubais-dp-world-replaces-ceo-after-epstein-links-emerge.html)**: CEO of DP World**

Sulayem resigned as CEO of Dubai's largest port operator on Feb. 13, after leading the company for 10 years. Documents showed Epstein once referring to Sulayem as one of his "[most trusted friends.](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00962669.pdf)" CNBC has reached out to the government of Dubai Media Office and DP World, seeking comment from Sulayem, who to date has not issued a statement on the situation.

[**Kathryn Ruemmler**](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/12/epstein-files-goldman-sachs-kathy-ruemmler.html)**: Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel at Goldman Sachs**

Ruemmler, a former White House counsel under then-President [Barack Obama](https://www.cnbc.com/barack-obama/), announced her resignation from [Goldman Sachs](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GS/) on Feb. 12, effective at the [end of June](https://www.ft.com/content/c9c4ea8a-f806-4a04-b409-a8ec03c00b15). Last week, [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/when-the-fbi-arrested-epstein-he-called-kathryn-ruemmler-39f7bf73?st=AV91Cw&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) reported that Ruemmler was one of three people Epstein called when he was arrested in July 2019. She once thanked Epstein after receiving luxury gifts from him, calling him "Uncle Jeffrey." Ruemmler told the [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/finance/goldman-sachs-ruemmler-epstein-8c8255fd?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqf1pT4X1XGiSiVbq3TUZ9lyun3gSf3ayhItEd8jM0chRnbVPUy9H_EwAHwZ9VQ%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6991f6c0&amp;gaa_sig=9lFUoJWFDVOyaDomHkX2bJbYo_VMIRTxLLOGZn4F8W6nIm9ctn1AkE6RKUA_tgIshIxZJAvhVKbdb0pWo_3Wmw%3D%3D) in January: "As I have said, I regret ever knowing him, and I have enormous sympathy for the victims of Epstein's crimes." 

[**Brad Karp**](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/05/paul-weiss-brad-karp-resigns-jeffrey-epstein.html)**: Chairman of Paul Weiss**

Karp resigned as chairman of [Paul Weiss](https://www.paulweiss.com/) on Feb. 4, after leading the major corporate law firm since 2008. Files show Karp thanking Epstein for a ["once in a lifetime"](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02493083.pdf) evening in 2015, and asking if he could help his son land a job on a [Woody Allen](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00698570.pdf) film in 2016. Days before he resigned, Paul Weiss issued a statement to [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/business/karp-epstein-paul-weiss.html) saying, "Mr. Karp attended two group dinners in New York City and had a small number of social interactions by email, all of which he regrets."

Gelernter was barred from teaching classes at Yale on Feb. 11 as the university conducts a review of his relationship with Epstein. Gelernter had extensive email communications with Epstein, which included one 2011 missive in which the professor recommended a Yale student for a project, referring to her as a "[small goodlooking blonde](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02723728.pdf)." Gelernter has not responded to CNBC's requests for comment after Yale took action.

[**Bill Clinton**](https://www.cnbc.com/bill-clinton/)**: Former U.S. president**

Clinton flew on Epstein's private plane multiple times in 2002 and 2003, and was photographed in casual social settings with Epstein and the sex offender's now-convicted procurer, [Ghislaine Maxwell](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/17/ghislaine-maxwell-habeas-petition-jeffrey-epstein.html). Clinton initially resisted a subpoena by the House Oversight Committee to testify about Epstein, but agreed to appear after it threatened to hold him in contempt of Congress. Clinton is due to testify on Feb. 27. Clinton's spokesman in 2019 [issued a statement](https://x.com/angelurena/status/1148357927625023490?s=20) saying, "President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he has been recently charged in New York." Clinton on Feb. 7 [retweeted a post on X](https://x.com/angelurena/status/2020230841260003825?s=20) from his spokesman that said, "What DOJ has released thus far, and the manner in which it has done so, makes one thing clear: someone or something is being protected. We don't know who, what, or why. We do know this: we need no such protection. It's why only the Clintons have called for a public hearing."

[**Hillary Clinton**](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/05/jeffrey-epstein-hillary-clinton-public-hearing-congress.html)**: Former secretary of State**

Hillary Clinton, who is married to the former president, has said she does not recall ever speaking to Epstein. Despite that, the House Oversight Committee subpoenaed her to testify for its inquiry into the predator. Like former President Clinton, the former secretary of State initially refused to appear, but then agreed to testify on Feb. 26 after being threatened with a contempt finding. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14, Clinton again called for the release of all of the Epstein files, saying, "It is something that needs to be totally transparent," [The Independent reported](https://www.the-independent.com/tv/news/hillary-clinton-epstein-munich-security-conference-b2920755.html). "I've called for many, many years for everything to be put out there so people can not only see what's in them but also, if appropriate, hold people accountable. We'll see what happens," she said.

Mandelson was fired by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Sep. 12 and [resigned](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/former-uk-minister-mandelson-quits-labour-after-new-epstein-revelations-media-2026-02-01/) from the Labour Party on Feb. 2 over his ties to Epstein. Mandelson wrote a note in Epstein's 50th Birthday Book, addressing him as ["my best pal,"](https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/09/Request-No.-1.pdf) and has been accused of sending Epstein market-sensitive [government information](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/uk-keir-starmer-peter-mandelson-labour-epstein-files-politics.html) following the 2008 financial crisis. Mandelson, in comments to the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/085e20be-0e98-4c9b-8db7-ed52ea279575) in February 2025, said, "I regret ever meeting him or being introduced to him by his partner [Ghislaine Maxwell](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ghislaine-maxwell)." He also said, "I regret even more the hurt he caused to many young women. I'm not going to go into this. It's an FT obsession and frankly you can all f--- off. OK?"

McSweeney resigned Feb. 11, taking responsibility for Starmer's appointment of Mandelson as ambassador. McSweeney told reporters, "The decision to appoint Peter Mandelson was wrong," adding that the former ambassador "damaged our party, our country and trust in politics itself."

The former Treasury secretary was named as a backup executor in a 2014 version of [Epstein's will](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016884.pdf). Summers, in [a statement in November](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/17/larry-summers-jeffrey-epstein-harvard.html), said, "I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein."

[In a 2019 statement](https://www.royal.uk/statement-his-royal-highness-duke-york), Mountbatten-Windsor said, "I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein. His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure. I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives. Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required."

Ferguson's charity, Sarah's Trust, which focused on improving the lives of women and children, announced on Feb. 2 that it would be shutting down. The ex-wife of Andrew Mountbatten Windsor described Epstein as ["a legend"](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00764381.pdf) and ["the brother I have always wished for](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00773265.pdf)" in emails long after his first conviction in 2008. In a [statement to the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/21/sarah-ferguson-apologised-to-jeffrey-epstein-after-disowning-him-leaked-emails-suggest) last September, a spokesperson for Ferguson said, "The duchess spoke of her regret about her association with Epstein many years ago, and as they have always been, her first thoughts are with his victims."

Lang, the highest-profile figure in France affected by the files, resigned as president of the Arab World Institute on Feb. 7 after leading the cultural center since 2013.

French authorities have said they are investigating reports of financial connections between Lang and Epstein, with the financial prosecutor's office [probing Lang and his daughter, Caroline,](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/07/veteran-french-politician-quits-as-head-of-prestigious-institute-after-epstein-links-revealed) on suspicion of "aggravated tax fraud laundering."

[Lajčák reportedly told Radio Slovakia](https://www.euronews.com/2026/02/03/slovak-ex-minister-and-fico-adviser-who-quit-over-epstein-messages-feels-like-a-fool), "When I read those messages today, I feel like a fool." He said in the same interview that he had shown "poor judgment and inappropriate communication ... Those messages were nothing more than foolish male egos in action, self-satisfied male banter." He added, "There were no girls … the fact that someone is communicating with a sexual predator does not make him a sexual predator."
