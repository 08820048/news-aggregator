[EssilorLuxottica](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/EL-FR/)'s more than tripled its [Meta](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/) artificial intelligence glasses sales last year, the Ray-Ban maker said on Wednesday in its [fourth-quarter](https://www.essilorluxottica.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/q4-full-year-2025-results/) results.

The French-Italian eyewear brand said it sold over 7 million AI glasses last year.

That's up from the 2 million that the company sold in 2023 and 2024 combined, according to its quarterly report [last February](https://www.essilorluxottica.com/cap/content/245084/).

The figure reported Wednesday includes smart glasses sold under the brands for Ray-Ban and Oakley, the latter of which was unveiled [in June](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/20/meta-essilorluxottica-oakley-smart-glasses-hstn.html).

The company's smart glasses success is the latest sign that the adoption of wearable AI devices is gaining momentum with consumers.

"Our success in wearables is helping to propel the AI-glasses revolution, with our iconic brands being a powerful driver of demand," the company said in a release.

EssilorLuxottica has been working on the wearable devices with the social media company since 2019, CNBC [reported](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/17/facebook-enlists-ray-ban-maker-luxottica-to-make-orion-ar-glasses.html) at the time. The two companies launched the first edition of the glasses in [September 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/09/facebook-ray-ban-stories-smart-glasses-review.html), but the device didn't gain widespread attention until the second-generation launch in [2023](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/09/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review.html).

In September, EssilorLuxottica and Meta introduced a [new Ray-Ban iteration](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/zuckerberg-799-meta-ray-ban-display-glasses.html), controllable through hand gestures and neural technology. That device retails for $799 and features a small display in one of the lenses.

Meta in January said it would [pushback](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/06/meta-ray-ban-display-ai-glasses-pause.html) the international launch of the Ray-Ban Display glasses, originally slated for early 2026, due to "unprecedented" demand in the U.S.

Last month, [Bloomberg reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-13/meta-said-to-discuss-doubling-ray-ban-glasses-output-after-surge-in-demand) that Meta and EssilorLuxottica were discussing doubling production to at least 20 million by the end of this year to meet growing demand.

Meta has indicated its commitment to working with the glasses maker and extended a [long-term partnership agreement](https://www.essilorluxottica.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/essilorluxottica-and-meta-announce-long-term-partnership/) to "collaborate into the next decade" in 2024.
