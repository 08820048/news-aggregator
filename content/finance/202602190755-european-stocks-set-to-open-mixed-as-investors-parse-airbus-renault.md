LONDON — European stocks are expected to open in mixed territory on Thursday as investors weigh earnings from [Airbus](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AIR-FR/), [Renault](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/RNO-FR/), and [Nestle,](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NES.N-CH/) amongst others.

The U.K.'s [FTSE](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.FTSE/) index is seen opening 0.15% higher, Germany's [DAX](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.GDAXI/) down 0.25%, France's [CAC 40](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.FCHI/) down 0.15% and Italy's [FTSE MIB](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.FTMIB/) slightly below the flatline, according to data from IG.

It's another busy day of earnings Thursday with Nestle, Rio Tinto, [Zurich Insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ZUR.N-CH/), and Renault among the European companies reporting.

Airbus said Thursday it expects to [deliver 870 commercial aircraft in 2026](https://www.airbus.com/en/investors/financial-results), slightly fewer than the roughly 880 analysts had expected. It comes as pressure is building for the European planemaker, with U.S. rival [Boeing](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BA/) showing signs of recovery after years of crisis, which has benefited Airbus.

French carmaker [Renault's revenue for 2025](https://media.renaultgroup.com/renault-group-demonstrates-its-resilience-the-robustness-of-its-strategy-and-moves-forward-with-confidence/?lang=eng) was up 3% to 57.9 billion euros ($68 billion), but net income dropped significantly to a loss of 10.9 billion euros with CEO François Provost citing a "challenging market environment" last year. Net income was impacted by a one-off charge from Renault's investment in Nissan.

[Nestle's 2025 sales](https://www.nestle.com/media/pressreleases/allpressreleases/full-year-results-2025) came in at 89.49 billion Swiss franc, down 2% from 91.35 billion Swiss franc in the previous year. Net profit dropped 17% to 9 billion Swiss franc. The company's organic growth stood at 3.5% for the year.

The Swiss food giant said it is in advanced negotiations to sell its ice cream business to Haagen-Dazs owner Froneri. This comes after the company [recalled baby formula](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/16/baby-formula-nestle-danone-probe-aptamil-sma.html) that contained toxins last month**.**

Global market sentiment is also in focus; [U.S. stock futures](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/18/stock-market-today-live-updates.html) traded near the flatline Wednesday night after the major averages posted a winning session Wednesday, buoyed by gains across the "Magnificent Seven" technology stocks and strength in financials and energy names.

Investors stateside also weighed minutes from the Federal Reserve's January meeting, which [reflected a divide among central bank officials](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/18/fed-minutes-january-2026.html) on the future outlook for monetary policy.

Oil prices rose by more than 4% yesterday after U.S. Vice President JD Vance said that Iran did not address [core U.S. demands](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/18/oil-prices-today-iran-trump-nuclear-talks.html) in nuclear talks this week. He said that President Donald Trump maintains the right to use military force if diplomatic efforts do not stop Iran's nuclear program. 

In [Asia-Pacific markets](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/19/asia-pacific-markets-kospi-nikkei-225-nifty-50.html) overnight, stocks traded higher, with several bourses in the region returning from the Lunar New Year holiday.
