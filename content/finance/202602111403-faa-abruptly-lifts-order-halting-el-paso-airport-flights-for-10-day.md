The Federal Aviation Administration abruptly grounded all flights in and out of El Paso International Airport in Texas for 10 days starting Wednesday, citing "special security" instructions, and then lifted the order hours later.

"The temporary closure of airspace over El Paso has been lifted," the FAA said in a post on X. "There is no threat to commercial aviation. All flights will resume as normal."

The FAA didn't immediately say what the security reasons for the temporary sudden halt were. The airport sits next to Biggs Army Airfield and is near the Mexican border, about 12 miles from Juarez, Mexico. The Pentagon referred a question about the nature of the security issue to the FAA.

Flights were initially halted until late Feb. 20 and the ban applied to a 10-nautical-mile area around the airport.

While the FAA regularly halts flights at airports for weather and traffic, a security issue is highly unusual as is an effective airspace closure for this long.

U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Texas Democrat whose district includes much of El Paso, said the move to suddenly close airspace was "unprecedented" and said that "what my office and I have been able to gather overnight and early this morning, there is no immediate threat to the community or surrounding areas."

"There was no advance notice provided to my office, the City of El Paso, or anyone involved in airport operations," she said in a statement. "We have urged the FAA to immediately lift the Temporary Flight Restrictions placed on the El Paso area."

The airport served nearly 3.5 million people in the first 11 months of 2025 and is served by [Southwest Airlines](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LUV/), [Delta Air Lines](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DAL/), [American Airlines](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAL/), [United Airlines](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UAL/) and [Frontier Airlines](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ULCC/), according to airport data.

There were 1,314 departures scheduled for the El Paso airport this month, according to aviation-data firm Cirium.

United waived change fees for customers who need to move their flights because of the airspace closure. Southwest said it has reached out to affected travelers.

"Nothing is more important to Southwest than the Safety of its Customers and Employees," it said.
