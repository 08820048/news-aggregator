Autonomous driving company Wayve has hit an $8.6 billion valuation after securing fresh funds from [Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/), [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/) and [Uber](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UBER/).

The $1.2 billion Series D round was led by Eclipse, Balderton and SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and also featured automakers [Mercedes-Benz](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MBG-DE/), [Nissan](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/7201.T-JP/) and [Stellantis](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/).

Uber will invest up to an additional $300 million in milestone-based capital.

"We are building for a total addressable market that spans every vehicle that moves," Alex Kendall, Wayve CEO, said in a statement.

"This investment accelerates our path to widespread commercial deployment and positions us to build the autonomy layer that will power any vehicle everywhere," he added.

Founded in 2017, U.K.-based Wayve is building autonomous driving software and AI models and has become one of Europe's most valuable startups. The company had raised upwards of $1 billion prior to this round.

In 2025, Wayve signed a partnership with Nissan to integrate its AI into the company's driver-assistance systems, with vehicles featuring the tech to be deployed from 2027.

The startup also has plans with Uber to launch public robotaxi trials beginning in London in 2026, before a wider rollout to more than 10 markets globally, Wayve said.

While autonomous driving has been promised by tech companies for years, the sector has faced technical and regulatory hurdles. Level 5 automation, where cars self-drive anywhere without the need for humans in the loop, has remained elusive.

But Recent [advances in AI](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/16/waymo-amazon-zoox-tesla-robotaxi-expansion.html) have led to renewed hope in the sector.

On Tuesday, Alphabet-owned Waymo announced it had [opened its robotaxi service](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/24/waymo-opens-robotaxi-service-to-select-riders-in-4-more-us-cities.html) to some public passengers in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Orlando.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has increasingly been [touting the company's credentials](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/14/musk-tesla-full-self-driving-subscription-fsd.html) as an autonomous mobility leader and Amazon's Zoox opened up rides to the public in 2025.
