[Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/) is having its worst day in the stock market in months. 

Shares of Apple were down 5% Thursday as reports surfaced about delays with Siri and its news app faced Federal Trade Commission scrutiny over [political bias](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/12/ftc-tim-cook-apple-news-censorship.html).

The long-awaited artificial intelligence update to the iPhone-maker's personal assistant [Siri](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-11/apple-s-ios-26-4-siri-update-runs-into-snags-in-internal-testing-ios-26-5-27) has been internally pushed back to May and potentially later, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. The update was expected to launch within a couple weeks, but the company may roll the features out slowly over several months, the report stated.

Apple told CNBC it is still on track to launch in 2026.

On Wednesday, the FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson [told Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/12/ftc-tim-cook-apple-news-censorship.html) CEO [Tim Cook](https://www.cnbc.com/tim-cook/) to review the terms of service and curation policies on Apple News.

Ferguson cited recent "reports" that Apple News was promoting left-leaning news outlets while suppressing conservative content.

Last month, Apple beat Wall Street expectations when it [reported](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/29/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q1-2026.html) first-quarter earnings, however, the stock has been tied to Wall Street's recent concerns about big tech spending too much on AI.

Tuesday, UBS [downgraded](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/tech-it-ubs-downgrade-ai-software.html) the U.S. tech sector to neutral, citing "software uncertainty" and heavy capital expenditure. The Swiss investment bank's move came after a sell-off in software stocks over the past week as investors turned cautious towards the sector.
