Asia-Pacific markets rose Monday amid tariff uncertainty as U.S. President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/) announced over the weekend that he would increase global tariffs to 15% from 10%.

The move came on the heels of a U.S. Supreme Court decision striking down a broad swath of the president's trade agenda enacted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA.

That said, U.S. trading partners are not off the hook, said Rystad Energy's chief economist Claudio Galimberti.

"While the Supreme Court's ruling invalidates a large share of existing tariffs and weakens the ability to target individual countries, it does not dismantle the broader tariff framework," he wrote in a note following the announcement.

If the upper tariff limit is reached without prior IEEPA exemptions, the average rate could climb even higher than under the structure the Supreme Court just struck down, Galimberti added.

South Korea's [Kospi](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.KS11/) rose for a third straight session, jumping 1.7% to a fresh record high. Index heavyweights SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics rose over 3% and 2%, respectively.

The small-cap Kosdaq added 0.74%.

Australia's [S&P/ASX 200](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.AXJO/) added 0.17% in early trade.

Hong Kong's [Hang Seng index](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.HSI/) jumped over 2%.

Markets in China and Japan were closed for a holiday.

[Bitcoin](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BTC.CM=/) fell more than 3% to below $65,000 after U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to raise global tariffs to 15%.

"The move lower in bitcoin looks less like a crypto‑specific shock and more like a classic risk‑sentiment reset," said Christopher Hamilton, head of client investment solutions, APAC ex-Japan.

"Bitcoin has become increasingly sensitive to global liquidity conditions.  When markets reprice growth, inflation or policy risks as we're currently seeing with tariffs, bitcoin often acts as a high‑beta expression of risk rather than a defensive asset."

[Oil prices](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/17/brent-edges-lower-as-traders-turn-focus-to-key-us-iran-talks.html) were last seen trading lower, erasing earlier gains. International benchmark [Brent](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/@LCO.1/) crude futures fell 0.6% to $71.33 a barrel, while U.S. [West Texas Intermediate](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/@CL.1/) futures were 0.78% lower at $65.96.

"The Supreme Court ruling is a setback ... but it is not an end to his policy agenda," said Arthur Laffer, Jr., president of Laffer Tengler Investments.

Laffer said countries such as Vietnam and India that struck trade deals with the U.S. should think twice before backing away from those agreements, arguing that trade remains a central pillar of Trump's political and economic strategy and that the president is likely to keep pressing the issue.

On Friday, U.S. stocks rose after the Supreme Court ruling, potentially providing relief for companies burdened by higher costs from the duties and easing concern about sticky inflation still plaguing the U.S. economy.

The [S&P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX/) advanced 0.69% and closed at 6,909.51, while the [Nasdaq Composite](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.IXIC/) gained 0.9% and settled at 22,886.07. The [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI/) added 230.81 points, or 0.47%, and ended at 49,625.97. The 30-stock index recovered from a 200-point loss earlier in the session on disappointing economic data.
