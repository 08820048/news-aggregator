Asia-Pacific markets were mostly lower on Friday, after all three major Wall Street indexes declined overnight pressured by a drop in private credit stocks and Iran-U.S. tensions.

Prospects of a strike on Iran have risen with U.S. President Donald Trump saying that [he would take a call](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/19/trump-to-decide-whether-to-attack-iran-in-next-10-days-oil-prices-jump.html) to decide on military action against Tehran in the next 10 days.

Oil prices extended gains in reaction to that news, with [U.S. crude](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/@CL.1/) rising 0.29%, to trade at $66.62 per barrel on Friday. Global benchmark [Brent](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/@LCO.1/) gained 0.26%, to settle at $71.92.

Over in Asia, traders will assess Japan's inflation data, with headline inflation for January [dipping below](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/20/japan-core-inflation-january-boj-target-gdp-growth.html) the Bank of Japan's 2% target for the first time in 45 months.

Japan's [Nikkei 225](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.N225/) was down 1.29%, dragged by utilities stocks, while the Topix was 1.33% lower.

Shares of [Sumitomo Pharma](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/4506.T-JP/), one of the country's largest pharmaceutical companies, were volatile in early trade, climbing as much as 6.81% before plunging over 11%.

Hong Kong's [Hang Seng index](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.HSI/) was down 1.03%. Mainland China's markets are still closed for the Lunar New Year holiday.

The tech-heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.IXIC/) lost 0.31%.
