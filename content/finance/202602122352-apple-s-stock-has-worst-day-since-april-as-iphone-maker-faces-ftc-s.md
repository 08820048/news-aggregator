[Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/) just wrapped up its worst day on the stock market since April after reports surfaced about delays with Siri and as the company's news app faced [regulatory scrutiny](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/12/ftc-tim-cook-apple-news-censorship.html).

The stock dropped 5% on Thursday, wiping out its gain for the year and leaving it down almost 4% in 2026.

The long-awaited [artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/ai-effect/) update to the iPhone maker's [Siri](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-11/apple-s-ios-26-4-siri-update-runs-into-snags-in-internal-testing-ios-26-5-27) personal assistant has been internally pushed back to May and potentially later, Bloomberg reported Wednesday.

The update was expected to launch within a couple weeks, but the company may roll the features out slowly over several months, the report stated.

Apple told CNBC it is still on track to launch in 2026.

On Wednesday, Federal Trade Commission Chair Andrew Ferguson [told Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/12/ftc-tim-cook-apple-news-censorship.html) CEO [Tim Cook](https://www.cnbc.com/tim-cook/) to review the terms of service and curation policies on Apple News.

Ferguson cited recent "reports" that Apple News was promoting left-leaning news outlets while suppressing conservative content.

Last month, Apple beat Wall Street expectations when it [reported](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/29/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q1-2026.html) first-quarter earnings. However, the stock has been dragged down in part by Wall Street's recent concerns that big tech companies are spending too much on AI.

On Tuesday, UBS [downgraded](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/tech-it-ubs-downgrade-ai-software.html) the U.S. tech sector to neutral, citing "software uncertainty" and heavy capital expenditure. That followed a sell-off in software stocks over the past week as investors turned cautious toward the sector.
