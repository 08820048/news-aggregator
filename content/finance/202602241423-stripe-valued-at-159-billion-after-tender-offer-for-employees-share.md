[Fintech](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/05/09/stripe-co-founder-john-collison-on-ai-powering-a-good-old-fashioned-tech-race.html) startup [Stripe](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/stripe-2025-cnbc-disruptor-50.html) is now valued at $159 billion after a secondary stock sale for employees and shareholders, the company [announced](https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/stripe-2025-update) Tuesday.

The valuation shows blistering growth from a year ago, when it was valued at [$91.5 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/27/stripes-valuation-climbs-to-91point5-billion-in-secondary-stock-sale-.html). Stripe's valuation nearly tripled to $95 billion in 2021.

Thrive Capital, Coatue Management, a16z, and others are participating in the tender offer and Stripe will also repurchase shares, the company said in a release. Current and former employees are eligible to sell shares.

The company also [provided](https://stripe.com/annual-updates/2025) an update on its business, with total payment volume increasing to $1.9 trillion in 2025, up 34% over the year prior. Stripe said its revenue suite is on track to hit an annual run rate of $1 billion in 2026.

Stripe co-founder and president John Collison told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin in an interview that enterprise giants like Microsoft and Nvidia are increasingly turning to its offerings, along with a "really fast growing cohort" of artificial intelligence companies.

"AI is really acting as a tailwind for the business," Collison said.

Founded in 2010 by brothers John and Patrick Collison, Stripe makes software that enables businesses to process payments online. The company was 10th in CNBC's [Disruptor 50](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/2025-cnbc-disruptor-50-see-the-full-list-of-companies.html) list for 2025.

The startup has emerged as one of the most valuable fintech companies, and investors have eagerly awaited a potential initial public offering.

Collison said Stripe's business is at an "incredible moment of takeoff" and an IPO would ultimately distract from its other goals.

"For us right now, an IPO would be a solution in search of a problem," Collison said. "We have a self-funding business that's growing very well with lots of new products that we want to go create and so we just don't need the extra capital right now."

Going public isn't "one of our top five or ten or twenty priorities," he added.

Stripe said it was "robustly" profitable in 2025 while it continued to pursue acquisitions and invest heavily in product development.

The company acquired billing startup Metronome in January. Last year, it purchased crypto wallet provider Privy, as well as crypto startup [Bridge](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/04/stripe-closes-1point1-billion-bridge-deal-prepares-for-stablecoin-push-.html) for $1.1 billion, its largest acquisition to date.
