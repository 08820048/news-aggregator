President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2016/06/01/donald-trump-redefines-politics.html) on Friday vowed that voter-identification laws would be implemented for the 2026 midterm elections, even though legislation mandating them appears poised to stall in Congress.

"The Democrats refuse to vote for Voter I.D., or Citizenship. The reason is very simple — They want to continue to cheat in Elections," Trump [posted to Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/116065471857020644) Friday afternoon.

"This was not what our Founders desired. I have searched the depths of Legal Arguments not yet articulated or vetted on this subject, and will be presenting an irrefutable one in the very near future. There will be Voter I.D. for the Midterm Elections, whether approved by Congress or not!" he continued.
