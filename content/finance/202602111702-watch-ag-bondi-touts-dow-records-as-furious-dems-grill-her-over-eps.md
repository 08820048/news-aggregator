Attorney General Pam Bondi on Wednesday responded to [House](https://www.cnbc.com/congress/) Democrats' heated questions about the Trump administration's handling of the Epstein files by chastising them for ignoring stock market gains and other of President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/)'s political wins.

"The [Dow](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/stock-market-today-live-updates.html) is over 50,000 right now," Bondi said in sworn testimony before the House Judiciary Committee after Rep. [Jerrold Nadler](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/24/robert-mueller-wants-to-testify-in-private-before-congress-jerrold-nadler.html), D-N.Y., slammed her and the Department of Justice for so far failing to [indict](https://www.cnbc.com/crime/) any of convicted sex predator Jeffrey Epstein's co-conspirators.

The S&P 500 is also up and the Nasdaq is "smashing records," while Americans' retirement accounts are "booming," Bondi said after celebrating the [Dow Jones Industrial Average's gains](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/). "That's what we should be talking about."

Democrats balked at the rhetoric, but Bondi doubled down.

"What does the Dow have to do with anything? That's what they just asked. Are you kidding?" she said as Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, banged a gavel and called for order in the hearing room.

Trump has repeatedly mentioned stock market gains as a barometer for his presidency after having been elected to a second term amid voter concerns about rising prices for consumer goods. The Dow closed above 50,000 for the first time on Friday and added to that record each day this week.

The DOJ oversight hearing had already devolved into partisan shouting matches on multiple occasions prior to Bondi's references to the stock market.
