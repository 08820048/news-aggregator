Shares of [RingCentral](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/RNG/) and [Five9](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/FIVN/) surged on Friday after earnings from both software firms [alleviated recent fears](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/29/software-stocks-enter-bear-market-on-ai-disruption-fear-with-servicenow-plunging-11percent-thursday.html) that [artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/ai-effect/) is eating away at their business models.

RingCentral popped 34%, while Five9 rallied about 12% after [topping Wall Street's](https://investors.five9.com/news-releases/news-release-details/five9-reports-record-full-year-2025-revenue-11-billion) estimates and issuing upbeat guidance. Both companies, which provide customer service solutions like voice integration, said accelerating AI adoption has boosted demand.

New AI tools, capable of building apps and websites in a matter of minutes, have [spooked investors](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/04/software-experiencing-most-exciting-moment-as-ai-fears-hammer-stocks.html) in recent weeks, leading to a massive selloff across the software sector.

The worry is that these products, emerging from the likes of [Anthropic](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/anthropic-cnbc-disruptor-50.html) and [OpenAI](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/openai-cnbc-disruptor-50.html), will displace the software-as-a-service industry's longstanding business models as firms lean on quicker and more efficient AI tools.

So far this year, the [iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/IGV/) tracking the sector has plunged about 23%, led to the downside by [Atlassian](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TEAM/), [Unity Software](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/U/) and [Rapid7](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/RPD/), which have shed more than half their value.

Software giants [Salesforce](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CRM/) and [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/) have dropped 30% and 18%, respectively.

RingCentral, which is up about 37% this year after a 17% slump in 2025, called AI a tailwind to its business, telling investors on Thursday that annual recurring revenue from customers using the tools doubled year over year to nearly 10%.

The company also recently [integrated ChatGPT models](https://www.ringcentral.com/whyringcentral/company/pressreleases/ringcentral-drives-new-era-of-enterprise-voice-ai-performance-with-openai.html) into its voice AI product.

Elsewhere, Five9 told investors that its enterprise AI bookings more than doubled from a year ago, leading to an uptick in its backlog. Management also said the firm's AI portfolio hit $100 million in annual recurring revenue.

Chairman Michael Burkland told analysts during an earnings call on Thursday that Five9 leverages large language models, or LLMs, to enhance solutions for its customers, but maintains an "absolute competitive moat."

"We're going to continue to have advancements by LLMs, but I've said this even two years ago, you cannot run a customer service organization on an LLM," he said.

Five9 shares have declined nearly 4% this year, following a 51% sell-off in 2025.
