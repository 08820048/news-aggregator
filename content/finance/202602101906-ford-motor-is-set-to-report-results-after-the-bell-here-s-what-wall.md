DETROIT — [Ford Motor](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/F/) is set to report its fourth-quarter and year-end earnings after the markets close Tuesday.

Here's what Wall Street expects, based on average analysts' estimates compiled by LSEG.

-   **Earnings per share:** 19 cents adjusted
-   **Automotive revenue:** $41.83 billion

Those results would mark a 6.8% decline in revenue compared with a year earlier and a more than 50% fall in adjusted earnings per share.

Ford's [2024 fourth-quarter results](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/05/ford-motor-f-earnings-q4-2024.html) included $44.9 billion in automotive revenue, net income of $1.8 billion, or 45 cents per share, and adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $2.1 billion, or 39 cents per share adjusted EPS.

Ford's fourth-quarter 2025 results will include a number of one-time charges or special items, including [$600 million](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/30/ford-q4-earnings-pension-charge.html) due to adjustments in postretirement benefits and a majority of [$19.5 billion related](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/15/ford-ev-pullback.html) to a restructuring of its business priorities and a pullback in its all-electric vehicle investments.

Automakers commonly exclude "special items" or one-time charges from their adjusted financial results to provide investors with a clearer picture of their core, ongoing business operations.

Along with quarterly results, investors will be watching for updates on Ford's business plans and its 2026 forecast. They'll also want to know about any production updates for its F-Series pickup trucks after a supplier fire that has impacted business.
