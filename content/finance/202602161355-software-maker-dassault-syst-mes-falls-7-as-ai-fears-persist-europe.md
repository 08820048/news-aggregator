European markets traded higher on Monday, as investors digest the key points from this year's Munich Security Conference.

The pan-European [Stoxx 600](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.STOXX/) was up 0.3% at 1:55 p.m. in London (8:55 a.m. ET), with major bourses and most sectors in the region in positive territory.

Trading of [Dassault Systemes](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DSY-FR/) shares were briefly halted Monday after the company fell sharply. The pause came as broker AlphaValue cut its rating from Buy to Reduce amid renewed concerns over AI monetization and a "worrying loss of momentum" at the French software group. Its shares were last seen more than 7% lower in afternoon dealmaking.

Geopolitics and defense returned to the spotlight as investors focused on this year's Munich Security Conference. The event saw several European leaders and policymakers reiterate the need for greater defense spending to accelerate the continent's strategic autonomy, with discussions of a common nuclear shield.
