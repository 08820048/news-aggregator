[Salesforce](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CRM/) shares climbed Thursday after the customer service software maker reported healthy results, although its fiscal 2027 revenue view trailed Wall Street projections.

The company posted results Wednesday after the market close for its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on Jan. 31.

Here's how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

-   **Earnings per share:** $3.81 adjusted vs. $3.04 expected
-   **Revenue:** $11.20 billion vs. $11.18 billion expected

Salesforce's revenue grew 12% year over year in its fourth quarter, according to a [statement](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260225325122/en/Salesforce-Delivers-Record-Fourth-Quarter-Fiscal-2026-Results). It's the company's fastest growth rate in two years.

The company has allocated $50 billion for new share buybacks, "because these are some low prices," CEO Marc Benioff said on a conference call with analysts. As of Wednesday's close, Salesforce shares had fallen about 28% so far in 2026, while the S&P 500 index had gained 1%.

Net income of $1.94 billion, or $2.07 per share, increased from $1.71 billion, or $1.75 per share. Adjusted earnings per share excludes stock-based compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangible assets and restructuring costs.

Current remaining performance obligation, a sum of contracted but unrecognized revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue over the next year, came in at $35.1 billion. The figure was higher than StreetAccount's $34.53 billion consensus.

Guidance for the fiscal first quarter included $3.11 to $3.13 in adjusted earnings per share on $11.03 billion to $11.08 billion in revenue. Analysts surveyed by LSEG were looking for $3.00 per share and $10.99 billion in revenue.

For the 2027 fiscal year, Salesforce called for $13.11 to $13.19 in adjusted earnings per share on $45.8 billion to $46.2 billion in revenue, which implies 10% to 11% growth. The LSEG consensus had $13.12 per share on $46.06 billion in revenue.

Meanwhile, Salesforce is seeing a benefit from its stake in Anthropic, generating an $811 million gain on strategic investments in the quarter. That's up from $96 million in the year-ago quarter.

"I think we just put another $100 million into the new round," Benioff said. We're \[at\] about $330 million into Anthropic invested. It's almost about 1% of Anthropic. And believe me, I wish we had invested a lot more."

Benioff said the company isn't doing all that it can with debt.

"We're just very under-leveraged on our balance sheet," he said.
