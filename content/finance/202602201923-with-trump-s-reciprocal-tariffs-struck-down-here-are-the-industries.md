The Supreme Court on Friday ruled that President [Donald Trump's](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/) country-specific "reciprocal" tariffs are [unconstitutional](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/20/supreme-court-trump-tariffs-ruling.html), delivering a win for many consumer companies facing higher import costs.

But the ruling doesn't cover all sectors.

The Supreme Court reviewed tariffs enacted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, which the Trump administration used to justify the sweeping tariff agenda. The act had never before been used by a president to impose tariffs.

In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court [ruled](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/25pdf/24-1287_4gcj.pdf) that IEEPA "does not authorize the President to impose tariffs."

Still, hours after the ruling, [Trump announced a new global 10% tariff,](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/20/trump-global-trade-tariff-supreme-court.html) and the Supreme Court's ruling does not cover tariffs enacted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Those duties are intended to target specific products that threaten national security, and they remain in effect after Friday's ruling.

Separate from his country-specific rates, Trump has raised tariffs on imports of steel, semiconductors, aluminum and other products deemed to impair national security.

Here are the sectors still facing higher levies even after the Supreme Court decision.

## Autos

It's not immediately clear how much the decision will impact the U.S. and global automotive industry. The industry continues to [face billions of dollars in tariff costs](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/20/tariffs-ford-tesla-gm-auto-industry-chaos.html), depending on where an imported auto part or vehicle originates.

The Trump administration last year broadly [implemented 25% tariffs](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/29/trump-auto-tariffs.html) on vehicles and certain auto parts imported into the U.S., citing national security risks. It has since struck independent deals to lower the levies to 10% to 15% with countries such as the United Kingdom and Japan. Others, such as South Korea, have also struck deals for lower rates, but it's unclear if those changes have actually taken effect.

"With today's decision out and subsequent developments, there remain many unknowns and important questions still to be answered. This is not a moment to ease up," said Lenny LaRocca, U.S. automotive lead for consulting firm KPMG. "Automakers should continue planning for multiple scenarios and keep supply chain considerations top of mind as the trade and tariff landscape continues to evolve."

America's largest automaker, [General Motors](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GM/), last month said it expects between $3 billion and $4 billion in tariff costs this year, and [Ford Motor](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/F/) earlier this month said its net tariff impact is expected to be roughly flat year over year at $2 billion in 2026.

Ford told CNBC in a statement that it is continuing to work with the government on policies that "promote a strong and globally competitive U.S. auto sector." GM did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Supreme Court decision.

## Pharmaceuticals

The pharmaceutical industry is facing a lot of uncertainty over tariffs. Trump has repeatedly threatened tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, though they haven't yet taken effect, in part because of negotiated multiyear deals between the administration and drugmakers.

If that were to change, however, pharmaceutical tariffs would still be covered under Section 232.

The administration has floated imposing tariffs on the industry that could [eventually reach up to 250%](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/05/trump-says-pharma-tariffs-could-eventually-reach-up-to-250percent.html). Last July, Trump [threatened](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/08/trump-threatens-pharmaceutical-tariffs-200.html) 200% tariffs on pharmaceuticals, and the administration has already opened a [Section 232 investigation](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/16/healthy-returns-drugmakers-comment-on-trumps-pharmaceutical-tariffs.html) into pharmaceuticals to investigate the impact of imports on national security.

The tariff threats are a move to push drug companies to manufacture in the U.S. instead of abroad.

In December, multiple companies [inked a deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/19/nine-pharma-companies-ink-deals-with-trump-to-lower-drug-prices.html) with Trump to voluntarily lower their prices in exchange for a three-year exemption from any pharma tariffs — as long as they invest further in U.S. manufacturing. That deal included major players like [Merck](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MRK/), [Bristol Myers Squibb](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BMY/), [Novartis](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVS/) and more.

## Furniture

The furniture industry [found little relief](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/19/supreme-court-tariffs-furniture-retailers-threat.html) from Friday's Supreme Court ruling.

Last fall, items like couches, kitchen cabinets, vanities and more were hit with [higher tariffs](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/08/25/furniture-industry-prepares-for-tariffs-after-presidents-trump-social-post.html) under Section 232. The roughly 25% duties will remain in place even now that the IEEPA tariffs have been deemed unconstitutional.

The furniture industry is already facing greater uncertainty, with the 25% tariff expected to rise to 50% in 2027, and more broad pressures from higher interest rates and inflation.

Smaller companies are getting hit the hardest, with fewer resources to work with, while larger companies are facing bankruptcy, like Value City Furniture's parent company, American Signature Furniture, which went out of business late last year.

## Food and consumer packaged goods

Under Section 232, steel and aluminum imports into the U.S. are still carry tariffs.

With higher aluminum tariffs, companies like [Coca-Cola](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/KO/), [PepsiCo](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PEP/), [Keurig Dr Pepper](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/KDP/) and [Reynolds](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/REYN/) will continue to face higher costs associated with manufacturing their products.

Trump [hiked](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/19/trump-trade-steel-aluminum-tariffs-.html) aluminum tariffs to 50% last year.

Still, some of the key tariffs for the sector have been rolled back, even before Friday's ruling.

In November, Trump issued an executive order exempting several hundred [agricultural products](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/14/trump-cuts-tariffs-goods-prices.html), including bananas, coffee and spices, from tariffs. And in September, he similarly rescinded a 10% tariff on Brazilian pulp, a key component of paper towels, diapers and toilet paper.
