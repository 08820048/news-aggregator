U.K. police on Thursday arrested King Charles III's brother, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, on suspicion of misconduct in public office, with the monarch expressing his "deepest concern" over the latest development.

British police were seen arriving at Andrew's residence in Sandringham, England, on Thursday morning, according to earlier reports from the BBC and the Daily Telegraph.

Thames Valley Police said in a statement that they had arrested a man, who they did not name, in his 60s from Norfolk on suspicion of misconduct in public office and are carrying out searches at addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk. 

"Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office," Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said in [the police statement](https://www.thamesvalley.police.uk/news/thames-valley/news/2026/february/16-02-25/thames-valley-police-open-investigation-into-misconduct-in-public-office/).

"It is important that we protect the integrity and objectivity of our investigation as we work with our partners to investigate this alleged offence," he said, adding: "We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time." 

## King Charles reacts

Buckingham Palace initially declined to comment on the matter but the king issued a statement soon after.

"I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office," the king said in a statement sent to CNBC by Buckingham Palace.

"What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities," he added.

The police, Charles said, had the royal family's "full and wholehearted support and co-operation."

"Let me state clearly: the law must take its course. As this process continues, it would not be right for me to comment further on this matter," he said.

## Former prince

Andrew, the younger brother of the king and the second son of the late Queen Elizabeth II, had come under scrutiny due to his relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and allegations that he sexually assaulted a high-profile victim of Epstein's sex trafficking, Virginia Giuffre, when she was 17.

Andrew denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and denied ever meeting Giuffre, and there is no indication that his arrest on Thursday is related to Giuffre, who died in 2025.

Thames Valley Police has previously said it was "assessing" reports alleging that he sent confidential trade reports to Epstein in 2010, when he was Britain's special envoy for international trade. CNBC has contacted Andrew's spokesperson for further comment on the arrest.

The public outcry over Andrew's association with disgraced financier Epstein has had far-reaching consequences. The former prince was stripped of his royal titles, including "His Royal Highness" and "Prince," and is no longer a working royal.

Andrew was also forced to move out of his Windsor mansion, the Royal Lodge, to a smaller residence on Charles' Sandringham Estate. The king has cut Andrew's annual personal allowance and security funding, but is covering the cost of his new accommodation.

David Lammy, deputy U.K. prime minister and foreign secretary, told CNBC on Thursday that the arrest showed "no one is above the law."

"This is now a police investigation and that must run its course," he told CNBC's Arjun Kharpal at the AI Impact Summit in India.

Police have not disclosed any details or specifics as to the allegations being investigated or what prompted the arrest.

British police can hold suspects for 24 hours without charge, but this can be extended to 36 or 96 hours with special authorization.
