Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee said Tuesday that interest rate cuts aren't appropriate until there's more evidence that inflation is on its way down.

With recent indicators showing that inflation is well off its highs but still above the Fed's 2% target, Goolsbee noted that policymakers "have been burned by assuming transitory inflation" in the past and shouldn't make the same mistake again.

"I feel that front-loading too many rate cuts is not prudent in that circumstance," he said in remarks before the National Association for Business Economics at its annual gathering in Washington, D.C. "People express that prices are one of their most pressing concerns. Let's pay attention. Before we cut rates more to stimulate the economy, let's be sure inflation is heading back to 2%."

The [most recent inflation data](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/20/pce-inflation-december-2025.html), for December, showed core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, running at 3%, as measured by the consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's primary forecasting gauge. That was up 0.2 percentage point from November and came somewhat due to tariffs, which are viewed as temporary, but also from underlying pressures in the service sector and areas not directly impacted by the duties.

Specifically, Goolsbee said stubbornly high housing inflation isn't tariff driven, emphasizing the need for the Fed to be "vigilant."

Goolsbee noted that a 3% inflation rate "is not good enough — and it's not what we promised when the Federal Reserve committed to the 2% target. Stalling out at 3% is not a safe place to be for a myriad of reasons we know all too well." He has said previously that he thinks the Fed will be able to cut later in the year.

The remarks come with markets expecting the Federal Open Market Committee, of which Goolsbee is a voter this year, to stay on hold until at least June and probably July. Futures traders are placing about a 50-50 chance of a cut in June and about a 71% probability of a July reduction, according to the CME Group's [FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) gauge. The Fed enacted three quarter percentage point cuts in the latter part of 2025.

Fed Governor Christopher Waller, who has been an advocate for lower rates, took a more measured approach Monday while also speaking to the NABE conference.

Though Waller said he thinks policymakers should "look through" tariff impacts, he said recent data shows the labor market may be in better shape than previously indicated, mitigating the need for further cuts. If the jobs picture continues to improve, that would further lessen the case for cuts, though he said he isn't convinced that the January nonfarm payrolls data wasn't "more noise than signal."

Tuesday will be an active day for Fed speakers, with Governor Lisa Cook also due to present to the NABE later in the morning.
