[Figma](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/FIG/) is partnering with [Anthropic](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/13/anthropic-open-ai-super-bowl-ads.html) and launching a feature called "Code to Canvas" that converts code generated in [artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/ai-effect/) tools like [Claude Code](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/05/anthropic-claude-opus-4-6-vibe-working.html) into fully editable designs inside Figma.

The feature creates a bridge between AI coding tools and Figma's process, allowing users who have built working interfaces by prompting an AI agent to bring that output directly into Figma's canvas.

There, teams can refine it, compare options side by side, and align on design decisions.

The move reflects a broader bet that agentic coding tools like Claude Code haven't eliminated the need for design, and made it more essential. But the risk is that Figma is building a better on-ramp to a highway it no longer controls.

Watch our exclusive conversation with Figma CEO Dylan Field at 9:30 a.m. PT/12 p.m. ET at [this link](http://youtube.com/watch?v=iwXfQ5zrPR4&amp;feature=youtu.be).

If AI tools keep improving, teams may eventually skip the design refinement step altogether.

Anthropic's products have been at the center of a massive sell-off in software-as-a-service stocks that traders on Wall Street have dubbed the "SaaSpocalypse."

The [iShares software ETF](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/IGV/) has fallen into bear market territory. Names like [Salesforce](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CRM/), [ServiceNow](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NOW/), and [Intuit](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/INTU/) have taken double-digit hits.

Figma has been caught in the downdraft.

The stock has fallen dramatically since its IPO last summer, swept up in the same indiscriminate selling that has punished anything with a SaaS business model. The company reports earnings on Wednesday after market close.

Figma stock is down about 85% from the 52-week high of $142.92 that it reached in August.
