Secretary of Health and Human Services [Robert F. Kennedy Jr.](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/18/wall-street-executive-rfk-jr-anti-vaccine-group.html) defended President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/)'s executive order spurring the domestic production of the weed killer glyphosate, as his [Make America Healthy Again](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/07/rfk-jr-nutrition-guidelines-protein-processed-food.html) movement reels from the president's embrace of the chemical they despise.

Trump on Wednesday night signed an [executive order](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/18/trump-executive-order-weedkiller-hated-by-maha.html) invoking the Defense Production Act to compel the domestic production of elemental phosphorus and glyphosate-based herbicides. [Glyphosate](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/18/trump-executive-order-weedkiller-hated-by-maha.html) is the chemical in [Bayer-Monsanto's](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BAYERCROP-IN/) Roundup and is the most commonly used herbicide for a slew of U.S. crops. Trump, in the order, said shortages of both phosphorus and glyphosate would pose a risk to national security.

Kennedy backed the president in a statement to CNBC Thursday morning.

"Donald Trump's Executive Order puts America first where it matters most — our defense readiness and our food supply," he said. "We must safeguard America's national security first, because all of our priorities depend on it. When hostile actors control critical inputs, they weaken our security. By expanding domestic production, we close that gap and protect American families."

But Kennedy's MAHA coalition that supported Trump in the 2024 presidential election hates glyphosate, which has been alleged to cause cancer in myriad lawsuits. Now, the executive order threatens to unravel that coalition ahead of the 2026 midterm elections that could loosen the president's grip on Washington.

"Just as the large MAHA base begins to consider what to do at midterms, the President issues an EO to expand domestic glyphosate production," Kelly Ryerson, a prominent MAHA activist known as The Glyphosate Girl, said in a [post on X](https://x.com/GlyphosateGirl/status/2024286087040897427). "The very same carcinogenic pesticide that MAHA cares about most."

Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, a watchdog that has pushed back against chemicals in food for years, said in a statement that he "can't envision a bigger middle finger to every MAHA mom than this."

"Elevating glyphosate to a national security priority is the exact opposite of what MAHA voters were promised," Cook said. "If Secretary Kennedy remains at HHS after this, it will be impossible to argue that his past warnings about glyphosate were anything more than campaign rhetoric designed to win trust — and votes."

Kennedy, a former environmental attorney, notably once [won a nearly $290 million case against Monsanto](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/jury-orders-monsanto-pay-290m-roundup-trial-n899811) for a man who claimed his cancer was caused by Roundup. The executive order came down one day after [Bayer proposed paying $7.25 billion](https://www.bayer.com/media/en-us/monsanto-announces-roundup-class-settlement-agreement-to-resolve-current-and-future-claims/) to settle a series of lawsuits claiming Roundup causes cancer.

Former Rep. [Marjorie Taylor Greene](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/21/marjorie-taylor-greene-resign-trump-epstein-mtg.html), R-Ga., knocked Trump for signing "an EO protecting cancer causing Glyphosate in our foods."

Glyphosate is a critical chemical to American agriculture. It's applied to many key cash crops, such as corn and soybeans, and has been defended by agricultural trade organizations. Phosphorus is a key input to the creation of glyphosate, which the White House argues is necessary to maintain food security. Elemental phosphorus is also used in the manufacture of some military materials.

"Thank you, President Trump, for acknowledging the importance of glyphosate-based herbicides in American agriculture," the House Agriculture Committee Republicans said Wednesday night in an [X post](https://x.com/HouseAgGOP/status/2024318546604360080). "This is a vital step forward in ensuring a domestic supply of this critical crop input remains available for our producers."

House Agriculture Chair Rep. G.T. Thompson, R-Pa., is trying to push a [farm bill](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/11/massive-867-billion-farm-bill-inches-closer-to-finish-line.html) through Congress this year — a legislative package that covers federal farm support and nutrition subsidies. He's also come under fire from MAHA recently for a provision in that bill that would block state and local pesticide regulations from differing from federal guidance.
