Chinese humanoid robots are having a moment in the spotlight after a standout performance at the country's annual Spring Festival Gala earlier this week, with videos from the event circulating widely online. 

The [gala](https://youtu.be/Lk3T0DPPN3E?si=t12DFBxsL06tlJ26&amp;t=244), widely considered the world's most-watched television program, featured robots from several startups performing everything from kung fu moves to choreographed dances to elaborate gymnastics displays. 

The showing marked a sharp contrast from the [2025 Gala](https://youtu.be/DbMNc1oxi-g?si=CsDeV0YGW9aD7UoM&amp;t=2783), which had featured less advanced versions of the robots twirling handkerchiefs in a wobbly folk dance. 

Around that time, public demonstrations of the humanoids often drew skepticism, such as a robot marathon in April that made [headlines](https://fortune.com/article/china-first-robot-marathon-runners-trip-emit-smoke-fall-apart) for stumbles, crashes and breakdowns. 

But a year can make quite the difference. Viewers of this week's event have expressed everything from admiration for the technological advancements to concern about what they mean for the labor force and the U.S.-China tech race.

Analysts told CNBC that while humanoid robots still have more to prove, the advancements made over the past year warrant global attention.  

"People should absolutely be taking these robots seriously," Reyk Knuhtsen, analyst at SemiAnalysis, told CNBC. "After this spring gala demonstration, they're becoming visibly more lean, fluid, and capable." 

"As we watch them push the physical boundaries humans are capable of, it becomes apparent they can achieve human-level actions, and eventually superhuman-level performances," he added.

## China's early lead

China has already taken an early lead in the manufacturing and deployment of humanoid robots, according to data from Barclays.

Analysts at the company estimate that of the roughly 15,000 humanoid robot installations in 2025, China accounted for more than 85%, compared with just 13% in the U.S.

"The fundamental advantage that China has is a nearly vertically integrated robotics value chain: from the rare earths and high-performance magnets to the physical components, and the batteries," Zornitsa Todorova, Head of Thematic FICC Research at Barclays, told CNBC. 

Leading Chinese humanoid companies like Unitree are hoping to maintain that lead into this year. The start-up, whose robots were prominently featured at the Spring Festival Gala, expects between 10,000 and 20,000 shipments in 2026, the CEO [told local media](https://eu.36kr.com/en/p/3687105642737545) just before the show ended.

China's manufacturing advantage, combined with government support, has also enabled Chinese robotics producers to manufacture their products at much lower prices than competitors, Todorova said.

Unitree, for example, [advertises](https://www.unitree.com/g1) a base price of $13,500 for its G1 humanoid robot.

Meanwhile, Tesla's Optimus, a humanoid leader in the U.S., is expected to keep prices higher in the near term. CEO Elon Musk said during an [earnings call](https://www.youtube.com/live/Gub5qCTutZo?si=1XBSPj5WLZcUpMFT&amp;t=2523) in Jan. 2025 that the robot's production cost could fall below US$20,000 if annual output reaches 1 million units, though final pricing would depend on market demand.

Analysts expect U.S. humanoid manufacturers to also increase production this year, but say they likely have their work cut out for them.

"Other markets will ramp up but likely lag due to China's established supply chains and production scale," said Omdia chief analyst Lian Jye Su, adding that China is likely to lead for at least the next few years. 

## Caveats remain

While the Spring Festival Gala showcased rapid advances, analysts cautioned that humanoid robots still face technical hurdles, with AI and mechanical upgrades required.

"The enhanced dexterity shown in routines like aerial flips and weapon handling signals strong potential for economic impact in physically demanding tasks that involve delicate tool handling and precise movements," said Omdia's Su. 

"However, they still need to prove reliability in unstructured, human-centric environments for delicate tasks like healthcare or household assistance."

In those tasks, advances in the underlying AI and minutiae mechanical engineering will matter more than raw manufacturing and shipment numbers. 

"\[T\]he AI model race is still undecided, and that will be the defining factor in the end, as the robot will only be as useful as its model," said Knuhtsen. 

While China's robotics companies have impressed viewers with their flashy kung-fu routines, the analyst said advances in reasoning, longer task durations, and the ability to chain multiple tasks together to perform different chores will matter more this year.

"I think this is where a lot of economic value lies, and it's steadily improving."
