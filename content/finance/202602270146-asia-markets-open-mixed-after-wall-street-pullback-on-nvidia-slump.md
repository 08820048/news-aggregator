Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed Friday, after U.S. stocks declined overnight as Nvidia shares tumbled despite a quarterly earnings beat.

Japan's [Nikkei 225](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.N225/) slid 0.6%, while the Topix traded flat. The benchmark Japanese index hit 59,000 for the first time on Thursday before paring gains slightly.

South Korea's Kospi declined 1.1%, while the small-cap Kosdaq was down 0.35%.

Hong Kong [Hang Seng index](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.HSI/) rose 0.68%, while the CSI 300 slid 0.49%.

SK Hynix, which is a key supplier of high-bandwidth memory to Nvidia, dipped over 2%. [Samsung Electronics](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SSU-FF/), which has been [a decades-old](https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-teams-with-nvidia-to-lead-the-transformation-of-global-intelligent-manufacturing-through-new-ai-megafactory#:~:text=Samsung%20Electronics%20today%20announced%20plans,semiconductors%2C%20mobile%20devices%20and%20robotics.) partner of Nvidia, was down 0.69%.

[SoftBank Group](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/9984.T-JP/), a major investors in AI companies, declined over 3%.

Overnight in the U.S., the [S&P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX/) pulled back after the latest results from tech titan [Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/) and software giant [Salesforce](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CRM/) failed to boost the broader market.

The broad market index fell 0.54% to end at 6,908.86, while the [Nasdaq Composite](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.IXIC/) declined 1.18% and closed at 22,878.38. The [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI/) added 17.05 points, or 0.03%, to settle at 49,499.20.

Nvidia shares fell more than 5%, even after the chip giant posted a fourth-quarter earnings and revenue beat. The stock suffered its worst day since April. Other chip stocks such as [Broadcom](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AVGO/), [Lam Research](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LRCX/), [Western Digital](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WDC/) and [Applied Materials](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMAT/) also slid.
