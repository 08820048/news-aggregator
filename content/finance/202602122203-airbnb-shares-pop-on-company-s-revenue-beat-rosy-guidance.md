Shares of [Airbnb](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ABNB/) popped as much as 5% in extended trading Thursday after the company reported [fourth-quarter results](https://investors.airbnb.com/press-releases/news-details/2026/Airbnb-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx) that beat expectations for revenue and offered rosy guidance for the current period.

Here's how the company did based on analysts' estimates compiled by LSEG:

-   **Earnings per share:** 56 cents vs. 66 cents expected
-   **Revenue:** $2.78 billion vs. $2.72 billion expected

For the current period, Airbnb said it expects to report revenue of $2.59 billion to $2.63 billion. Analysts were expecting $2.53 billion for the quarter, according to LSEG. The company said it expects full-year revenue growth of "at least low double digits." Analysts were expecting 10.2% growth.

Airbnb's revenue increased 12% during the fourth quarter from $2.48 billion during the same period [last year](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/13/airbnb-abnb-q4-earnings-2024.html). Airbnb has beat Wall Street's revenue expectations for 20 of the past 21 quarters, according to FactSet.

The company reported net income of $341 million, or 56 cents per share, down from $461 million, or 73 cents per share, a year earlier. Airbnb attributed the lower figure to $90 million of non-income tax matters and planned investments in new growth and policy initiatives, according to a release.

Airbnb said it finished 2025 with "strong momentum," and that its results reflect the strength of its core business. The company connects users who are willing to rent out their homes with travelers who are looking for places to stay.

The company reported 121.9 million nights and seats booked in the fourth quarter, up 10% from a year ago and above the 117.6 million expected by StreetAccount.

Gross booking value, which Airbnb uses to report host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees and taxes, totaled $20.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up 16% year over year. That figure is above the $19.4 billion expected by analysts polled by StreetAccount.

Airbnb reported adjusted EBITDA — earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization — of $786 million during the period.

Last month, Airbnb [announced](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/14/airbnb-tech-chief-meta-ai.html) it hired Ahmad Al-Dahle, former head of generative [artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/ai-effect/) at [Meta](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/), as its new tech chief. Airbnb's previous technology chief, Ari Balogh, stepped down in December after more than seven years at the company.
