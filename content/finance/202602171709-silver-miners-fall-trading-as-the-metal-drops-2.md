Silver prices.

Gold and [silver prices tumbled in late January](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/30/silver-gold-fall-price-usd-dollar-fed-warsh-chair-trump-metals.html) as investors reacted to news that President Donald Trump had nominated Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve, leading to a stronger U.S. dollar. Silver futures plunged 30% at the time, marking their worst day since March 1980.

However, the sell-off in precious metals was short-lived, with [gold and silver rebounding](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/03/gold-and-silver-rebound-after-historic-wipeout-as-analysts-say-thematic-drivers-stay-intact-.html) in early February.

Elsewhere, Australian global mining company [BHP](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BHP-AU/) sealed a [silver deal](https://www.bhp.com/news/media-centre/releases/2026/02/bhp-enters-into-a-silver-streaming-agreement) with Wheaton Precious Metals. The mining giant said the long-term silver streaming agreement would see BHP receive an upfront payment of $4.3 billion in exchange for delivering silver produced at its Antemina mine.
