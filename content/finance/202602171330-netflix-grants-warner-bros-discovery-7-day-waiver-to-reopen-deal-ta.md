[Warner Bros. Discovery](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WBD/) on Tuesday said it will reopen deal talks with [Paramount Skydance](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PSKY/) under a seven-day waiver from [Netflix](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NFLX/) to explore "deficiencies" in Paramount's offer to buy the entirety of WBD.

The legacy media company has a [pending transaction](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/05/neflix-warner-bros-discovery-deal.html) with Netflix for its streaming and studio businesses. Paramount launched a [hostile tender offer](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/08/paramount-skydance-hostile-bid-wbd-netflix.html) straight to WBD shareholders at $30 per share after losing out to Netflix in a bidding war.

"Netflix has provided WBD a limited waiver under the terms of WBD's merger agreement with Netflix, permitting WBD to engage in discussions with Paramount Skydance ("PSKY") (NASDAQ: PSKY) for a seven-day period ending on February 23, 2026 to seek clarity for WBD stockholders and provide PSKY the ability to make its best and final offer," Warner Bros. Discovery said [in a release](https://ir.wbd.com/news-and-events/financial-news/financial-news-details/2026/Warner-Bros--Discovery-Sets-Special-Meeting-Date-of-March-20-2026-and-Unanimously-Recommends-Shareholders-Vote-FOR-Netflix-Merger-Warner-Bros--Discovery-to-Initiate-Discussions-with-Paramount-Skydance-for-Their-Best-and-Final-Offer/default.aspx).

"During this period, WBD will engage with PSKY to discuss the deficiencies that remain unresolved and clarify certain terms of PSKY's proposed merger agreement," it said.

Paramount leadership has repeatedly said its $30 per share, all-cash offer is not its "best and final." Last week the company [sweetened its offer](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/paramount-sweetens-wbd-bid-stops-short-of-raising-value-.html) with additional "enhancements," but stopped short of raising the per-share value.

Warner Bros. Discovery said Tuesday that a senior Paramount representative informed a WBD board member that it would pay $31 per share if deal talks were to reopen.

After the limited waiver period, Netflix will retain its matching rights provided by the merger agreement, WBD said.

"Throughout the entire process, our sole focus has been on maximizing value and certainty for WBD shareholders," said WBD CEO David Zaslav in a statement. "Every step of the way, we have provided PSKY with clear direction on the deficiencies in their offers and opportunities to address them. We are engaging with PSKY now to determine whether they can deliver an actionable, binding proposal that provides superior value and certainty for WBD shareholders through their best and final offer."

WBD also on Tuesday announced a special meeting of shareholders will be held on March 20 and said its board continues to unanimously recommend the Netflix deal over Paramount's offer.

Netflix said [in a statement](https://ir.netflix.net/investor-news-and-events/financial-releases/press-release-details/2026/WBD-Files-Definitive-Proxy-Statement-and-Schedules-Special-Meeting-for-March-20-2026-to-Approve-the-WBD-Netflix-Transaction/default.aspx) the shareholder meeting date marked an "important milestone for our transaction with WBD."

"While we are confident that our transaction provides superior value and certainty, we recognize the ongoing distraction for WBD stockholders and the broader entertainment industry caused by PSKY's antics," Netflix said. "Accordingly, we granted WBD a narrow seven-day waiver of certain obligations under our merger agreement to allow them to engage with PSKY to fully and finally resolve this matter."

Shares of Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery were each up roughly 3% in premarket trading Tuesday.
