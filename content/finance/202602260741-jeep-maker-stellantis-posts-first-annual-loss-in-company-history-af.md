Auto giant [Stellantis](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/STLA/) on Thursday reported its first-ever annual loss after [saying](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/06/stellantis-reset-business-electric-vehicles.html) it had over-estimated the pace of the energy transition.

The multinational conglomerate, which owns household names including Jeep, Dodge, Fiat, Chrysler and Peugeot, [posted](https://www.stellantis.com/en/news/press-releases/2026/february/full-year-2025-results) a full-year 2025 net loss of 22.3 billion euros ($26.3 billion), compared to full-year profit of 5.5 billion euros a year ago.

The net loss was impacted by 25.4 billion euros in write-downs from last year, Stellantis said, citing a major strategic shift.

Stellantis said it had suspended its dividend for 2026, as it had previously flagged, and issued up to 5 billion euros of hybrid bonds. It also reiterated its 2026 forecasts, including a mid-single-digit percentage increase in net revenues and a low-single-digit adjusted operating margin.

"Our 2025 full year results reflect the cost of over-estimating the pace of the energy transition and of the need to reset our business around our customers' freedom to choose from the full range of electric, hybrid and internal combustion technologies," Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said in a statement.

"In 2026 our focus will be on continuing to close the execution gaps of the past, adding further momentum to our return to profitable growth," he added.

Other earnings highlights:

-   Stellantis said it expects positive industrial free cash flow in 2027.
-   The company posted an adjusted operating loss of 842 million euros in 2025, compared to an adjusted operating income of 8.65 billion euros in 2024.

Over the second half of 2025, Stellantis it delivered a "solid" performance, noting consolidated shipments came in at 2.8 million units, with North America posting the strongest contribution.

Net revenues rose 10% to 79.25 billion euros through the latter half of 2025 when compared to the same period a year ago.

Stellantis said these results reflect the initial impact of improved operational efficiencies, disciplined commercial strategies and the strength of the firm's global brand portfolio.

Milan-listed shares of Stellantis are down more than 31% so far this year.
