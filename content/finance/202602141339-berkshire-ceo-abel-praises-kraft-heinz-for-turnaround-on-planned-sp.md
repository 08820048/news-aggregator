Berkshire Hathaway's new CEO likes the surprise course reversal announced this week by the new CEO of [Kraft Heinz](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/KHC/).

In the food company's [Q4 earnings release](https://news.kraftheinzcompany.com/press-releases-details/2026/Kraft-Heinz-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx?__source=newsletter%7Cwarrenbuffettwatch), Steve Cahillane said in the time since [he joined the company](https://news.kraftheinzcompany.com/press-releases-details/2025/The-Kraft-Heinz-Company-Names-Steve-Cahillane-Chief-Executive-Officer/default.aspx?__source=newsletter%7Cwarrenbuffettwatch) five weeks ago, he has "seen that the opportunity is larger than expected and that many of our challenges are fixable and within our control."

As a result, he's decided to "pause work" on the planned separation of Kraft from Heinz [that was announced last September](https://news.kraftheinzcompany.com/press-releases-details/2025/The-Kraft-Heinz-Company-Announces-Plan-to-Separate-into-Two-Scaled-Focused-Companies-to-Accelerate-Profitable-Growth-and-Unlock-Shareholder-Value/default.aspx?__source=newsletter%7Cwarrenbuffettwatch). It would have essentially reversed [the merger Warren Buffett helped orchestrate in 2015.](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/03/25/kraft-foods-group-and-hj-heinz-merge-to-create-the-kraft-heinz-co.html)

Berkshire is KHC's biggest shareholder with a [27.5% stake currently worth $8.1 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/berkshire-hathaway-portfolio/).

In a [statement given to CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/kraft-heinz-pauses-split-new-ceo-challenges.html) and other news outlets, Berkshire CEO Greg Abel endorsed the change. "We support CEO Steve Cahillane and the Kraft Heinz Board of Directors' decision, under Steve's new leadership, to pause work on the company's previously planned separation. As a result, management can commit to strengthening Kraft Heinz's ability to compete and serve customers."

Buffett, who usually does not criticize the management of a Berkshire holding, was uncharacteristically vocal about his disapproval when [plans for the split were made public](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/02/kraft-heinz-split.html) more than five months ago.

[In an off-camera phone call with CNBC's Becky Quick](https://link.cnbc.com/public/41448525), he said he was "disappointed" and didn't rule out selling some or all of Berkshire's stake.

"It certainly didn't turn out to be a brilliant idea to put them together, but I don't think taking it apart will fix it."

Just three weeks ago, [Abel appeared to signal a sharp reduction](https://link.cnbc.com/public/43712803) of Berkshire's KHC position with an [SEC registratio](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001637459/000110465926005094/tm263487d1_8k.htm&amp;__source=newsletter%7Cwarrenbuffettwatch)n for "the potential resale" for "up to" 99.9% of the 325.6 million shares it reported holding as of September 30.

Kraft Heinz's decision to remain intact _may_ help keep those potential sales from becoming reality.

Did Berkshire's preparation for KHC share sales play a role in Cahillane's reversal?

I certainly don't know, but if it did, and if it was an intentional effort to pressure KHC, it would be a significant departure from Buffett's long-standing hands-off policy when it comes to the companies in Berkshire's equity portfolio.

Kraft Heinz shares fell when the split reversal was announced Wednesday morning but quickly rebounded to end the week with a small 0.7% gain.

**AUDIENCE QUESTION**: What were the three best books you read last year outside of the investment field? Why don't — even one will do.

**WARREN BUFFETT**: I'll give you — I'll tout a book first that I've read but that isn't available yet. But it will be in September.

The woman who wrote it, I believe, is in the audience and it's [Ben Graham's biography](https://www.amazon.com/Benjamin-Graham-Value-Investing-Lessons/dp/0793107024/?__source=newsletter%7Cwarrenbuffettwatch), which will be available in September, by Janet Lowe. And I've read it and I think those of you who are interested in investments, for sure, will enjoy it. She's done a good job of capturing Ben.

One of the books I enjoyed a lot was written also by a shareholder who is not here because he's being sworn in, I believe today or tomorrow, maybe tomorrow, as head of the Voice of America.

And that's Geoff Cowan's book, which is on "[_The People v. Clarence Darrow_](https://www.amazon.com/People-v-Clarence-Darrow-Americas/dp/0812921798/?__source=newsletter%7Cwarrenbuffettwatch)." It's the story of the Clarence Darrow trial for, essentially, jury bribery in Los Angeles back around 1912, when the McNamara brothers had bombed the _LA Times_.

It's a fascinating book.  Geoff uncovered a lot of information that the previous biographies of Darrow didn't have. I think you'd enjoy that...

**CHARLIE MUNGER**: Well, I very much enjoyed Connie Bruck's biography [_Master of the Game_](https://www.amazon.com/Master-Game-Connie-Bruck/dp/0671725742/?__source=newsletter%7Cwarrenbuffettwatch), which was a biography of Steve Ross, who headed Warner and later was, what, co-chairman of Time Warner.

**WARREN BUFFETT**: Yeah, he's a little more than co-chairman. (Laughs)

**CHARLIE MUNGER**: Yeah, and — she's a very insightful writer and it's a very interesting story.

I am rereading a book I really like, which is Van Doren's [biography of Benjamin Franklin](https://www.amazon.com/Benjamin-Franklin-Carl-Van-Doren/dp/0140152601/?__source=newsletter%7Cwarrenbuffettwatch), which came out in 1952 \[1938\], and I'd almost forgotten how good a book it was. And that's available in paperback everywhere. We've never had anybody quite like Franklin in this country. Never again.
