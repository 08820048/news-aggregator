The [House](https://www.cnbc.com/congress/) is scheduled to vote Wednesday on [a resolution](https://www.congress.gov/119/bills/hjres72/BILLS-119hjres72ih.pdf) disapproving of President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/)'s tariffs against Canada, in what could amount to a blow to Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and a rebuke of the president's signature economic policy.

The tariff resolution, introduced by Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., will be considered a day after a [procedural vote](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/gop-tariffs-trump-house-johnson.html) on a rule that would have barred House challenges to Trump's tariffs failed with the support of three Republican members.

"The Speaker continues to abdicate his responsibilities, ceding Congress's Article I authority to Donald Trump," Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a [statement posted to X](https://x.com/HouseForeign/status/2021423904246390936?s=20) on Tuesday. "Republicans now face a clear choice: go on the record and join Democrats in ending these cost-raising tariffs, or keep forcing American families to pay for them."

A vote on Trump's tariffs will force House Republicans to choose between loyalty to the president and striking down economic policy that many in the GOP conference do not like.

Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., and Don Bacon, R-Neb., bucked Trump and GOP leaders on Tuesday by voting with every Democrat to [defeat a rule](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/gop-tariffs-trump-house-johnson.html) that would have blocked House votes on Trump's tariffs through July 31.

"I don't like putting the important work of the House on pause, but Congress needs to be able to debate on tariffs. Tariffs have been a 'net negative' for the economy and are a significant tax that American consumers, manufacturers, and farmers are paying," [Bacon posted to X](https://x.com/RepDonBacon/status/2021418451911295376?s=20) after the Tuesday vote.

Because of the razor-thin GOP majority in the House, Johnson can afford to lose only one Republican vote if all Democrats are present and vote in favor of the resolution to end Trump's Canada tariff.

Still, the effort is likely symbolic. Even if the Senate approved Meeks' resolution, Trump would likely veto the legislation.

"This is life with a razor-thin majority," Johnson said in a Wednesday morning [appearance on Fox Business](https://x.com/atrupar/status/2021575438716297379?s=20). "I think it's a big mistake. I don't think we need to go down the road of trying to limit the president's power while he is in the midst of negotiating America-first trade agreements with nations around the world."
