A congressional deposition of [Leslie Wexner](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/29/victorias-secret-founder-les-wexner-is-reportedly-in-talks-to-step-aside-and-is-exploring-l-brands-sale.html), one of [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/15/epstein-files-fallout-goldman-ruemmler-harvard-yale.html)'s closest known associates and top benefactors, kicked off behind closed doors in Ohio on Wednesday, a source familiar with the matter told MS NOW.

The deposition is occurring weeks after the Department of Justice released millions of additional Epstein-related files, which have revealed new links between the notorious sex offender and major figures in [business](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/16/hyatt-chairman-pritzker-leaves-board-over-epstein-ties.html) and [politics](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/lutnick-epstein-island-vacation-congress.html).

Wexner, the 88-year-old retail billionaire and retired founder of [Victoria's Secret](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/VSCO/) [former parent company](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/20/victorias-secret-details-comeback-plan-after-l-brands-split.html) L Brands, has faced intense scrutiny for years over his personal and financial relationships with Epstein.

Decades earlier, Wexner had given Epstein, a high school math teacher turned well-connected money manager, power of attorney over his finances. Wexner had long been Epstein's only publicly known client.

Wexner has not been charged with any crime. After Epstein was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges in July 2019 — and died by suicide in jail a month later — Wexner said [he was embarrassed](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/10/les-wexner-im-embarrassed-that-i-put-my-trust-in-depraved-jeffrey-epstein.html) to have been " taken advantage of by someone who is ... so depraved."

The Wexner Foundation did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Wednesday's deposition. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee had [subpoenaed Wexner](https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/news/press-releases/ranking-member-robert-garcia-statement-after-subpoenas-formally-issued-to-epstein-associates-les-wexner-darren-indyke-and-richard-kahn) and other Epstein associates in January with bipartisan support.

"The most important information for us is really about the money," Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the Oversight Committee's ranking Democrat, [said on CNN](https://x.com/RepRobertGarcia/status/2024135323341430881?s=20) earlier Wednesday.

"We know that Wexner was Jeffrey Epstein's single largest benefactor," Garcia said. "When you think about Epstein's wealth, whether it was the plane, the island, the amount of money when had, his homes — much of that came directly from Wexner.

"We're not exactly sure why. It's not clear," he said. "When you talk to survivors, they'll all share with you that Wexner was at the center of what Epstein was doing."
