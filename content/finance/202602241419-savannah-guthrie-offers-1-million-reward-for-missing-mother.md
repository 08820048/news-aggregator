Savannah Guthrie in an emotional [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DVJKU2wADV3/?igsh=MnNnbGU4ZXY1M3A4) on Tuesday morning said that her family was offering a reward of up to $1 million for "any information" that would lead to the recovery of her missing mother, [Nancy Guthrie](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/suspect-in-nancy-guthries-abduction-detained-in-arizona-law-enforcement-official-says-reuters.html), who vanished from her Arizona home after last being seen there on Jan. 31.

"Help us bring our beloved mother home," said Savannah Guthrie, an anchor of NBC's "Today Show."

"Please be the light in the dark," she said.

Guthrie acknowledged that her 84-year-old mother may not be alive given the time that has passed, her age, and her medical issues.

"She may already be gone," Guthrie said.
