Dutch payments giant [Adyen](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ADYEN-NL/)'s stock fell as much as 20% after it posted net revenue guidance and payment processing volume that were slightly weaker than expected.

The company forecast net revenue growth of 20% to 22% for 2026, while analysts expected year-on-year growth at 22.8%, according to LSEG estimates.

"This outlook is underpinned by a strong pipeline and the continued ramp of our 2025 cohort, providing a solid foundation for the year ahead," Adyen said in its shareholder letter. "We expect market volume growth to remain broadly in line with 2025 levels, reflecting continued macroeconomic uncertainty."

Adyen processed 745.3 billion euros ($885.5 billion) in payments in the second half of the year, which came in below a 771-billion-euro revenue estimate from KBC Securities.

"Although results today and next year's outlook is largely ok, this might not be enough to turn around the very negative sentiment on the payment sector we have seen recently," KBC Securities said in a note on Thursday morning.

The stock was down 16% as of 11.15 a.m. local time, and shares are down around 16% so far this year.

Adyen stock in the year-to-date

Adyen reported net revenue had increased 17% YoY on a reported basis, hitting 1.27 billion euros, with both EMEA and North America growing 17% each.

Net revenue gains were "moderated by slower growth" from APAC-headquartered online retailers and a weaker U.S. dollar, the company said.

Net revenue from APAC clients accelerated slightly to 14% growth, which Adyen reported was mostly driven by deepened relationships with existing customers.

Net revenues for the second half were largely inline with analyst forecasts.

Adyen has seen some big stock swings in recent years. Its share price fell [39% in August 2023](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/17/adyen-earnings-h1-2023-stock-down-28percent-after-record-low-sales-growth.html), after reporting worse-than-expected sales and a profit drop in the first half of the year.
