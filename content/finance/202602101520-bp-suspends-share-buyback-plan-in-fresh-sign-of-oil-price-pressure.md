British oil giant [BP](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BP.-GB/) on Tuesday posted fourth-quarter profit in line with expectations and suspended share buybacks, seeking to shore up its balance sheet as lower crude prices take their toll.

The London-listed energy firm reported underlying replacement cost profit, used as a proxy for net profit, of $1.54 billion for the final three months of 2025. That matched analyst expectations of $1.54 billion, according to an LSEG-compiled consensus.

BP's full-year 2025 net profit came in at $7.49 billion, missing analyst expectations of $7.58 billion. That's down from nearly $9 billion in 2024.

BP said the board decided to suspend the share buyback and fully allocate excess cash "to accelerate strengthening" of its balance sheet. The firm's previous buyback was $750 million and was [announced](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/04/bp-earnings-q3-2025.html) alongside third-quarter results in November.

For the fourth quarter, the company announced a dividend per ordinary share of 8.320 cents.

"2025 was a year of strong underlying financial results, strong operational performance, and meaningful strategic progress," Carol Howle, BP interim CEO, said in a statement.

"We have made progress against our four primary targets - growing cash flow and returns, reducing costs, and strengthening the balance sheet - but know there is more work to be done, and we are clear on the urgency to deliver," she added.

Woodside Energy boss Meg O'Neill is scheduled to [take the reins at BP](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/18/woodside-energys-meg-oneill-to-replace-murray-auchincloss-as-bp-ceo.html) on April 1, following Murray Auchincloss' decision to step down late last year.

Shares of BP fell nearly 4% during early afternoon deals, paring some of its losses from earlier in the session.

Some other earnings highlights included:

-   BP's fourth-quarter net debt came in at $22.18 billion, down from around $23 billion in the same period last year.
-   Fourth-quarter operating cash flow came in at $7.6 billion, up from $7.43 billion a year ago.
-   BP set its 2026 capital expenditure budget at $13 billion to $13.5 billion, reflecting the lower end of its guidance range.

The results come at a tough time for Europe's oil and gas sector.

BP's industry rivals [Equinor](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/EQNR-NO/) and [Shell](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SHEL-GB/) both reported weaker quarterly earnings last week, citing lower crude prices, among other factors.

BP, Equinor and Shell shares year-to-date

Equinor [announced](https://www.equinor.com/news/equinor-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-results) it would reduce share buybacks to $1.5 billion this year, down from $5 billion last year, while also trimming investments in its renewables and low-emission energy projects.

Shell, for its part, [kept its buybacks steady at $3.5 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/05/shell-earnings-q4-2025.html), a move that marked the firm's 17th consecutive quarter of $3 billion or more in buybacks.

BP's decision to pause its share buybacks should be seen as a prudent step to prioritize balance sheet strength in a softer commodity price environment, according to Maurizio Carulli, global energy analyst at Quilter Cheviot.

"Under former CEO Murray Auchincloss's 'strategy reset' last April, buybacks had already been reduced from $1.75bn per quarter to $750m. The decision to cancel them entirely signals a more cautious stance and a clear focus on financial resilience," Carulli

"While the move was not a complete surprise to the market, particularly after similar actions by other oil majors, some shorter-term investors may be disappointed, which helps explain the share price weakness seen today. However, prioritising balance sheet strength in a softer commodity price environment is a prudent step.
