[Uber Eats](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UBER/) is bringing artificial intelligence to your next grocery shopping list.

The ride-hailing company said on Wednesday that its food delivery platform is debuting a new AI assistant that lets customers build a shopping cart using text or images, like handwritten grocery lists.

Uber is offering the feature through dozens of large retailers, including Safeway, Albertsons and Kroger. The tool accounts for item preferences and store availability and allows users to edit selections, the company said.

**"**Cart Assistant reflects how we think about AI at Uber: starting with real customer needs and building practical solutions within the app," said Praveen Neppalli Naga, Uber's technology, said in a release. "By grounding these features in real user behavior, we can build tools that feel helpful and intuitive."
