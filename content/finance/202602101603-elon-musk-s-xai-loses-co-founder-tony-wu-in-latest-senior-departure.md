[Elon Musk's](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/) xAI has lost another founding member.

Tony Wu announced late on Monday that he resigned from the [artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/) startup, becoming the latest co-founder to leave the company. Others, including [Igor Babuschkin](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/13/elon-musks-xai-loses-co-founder-igor-babuschkin-for-venture-firm.html), Kyle Kosic and Christian Szegedy, have also departed, and [Greg Yang](https://x.com/TheGregYang/status/2013652609455006006?s=20) announced last month that he would be stepping back from his role to focus on his battle with Lyme disease.

"It's time for my next chapter," Wu wrote in [a post](https://x.com/Yuhu_ai_/status/2021113745024614671?s=20) on X. "It is an era with full possibilities: a small team armed with AIs can move mountains and redefine what's possible."

Wu's departure comes as xAI faces a consumer backlash and [regulatory probes](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/05/india-eu-investigate-musks-x-after-grok-created-deepfake-child-porn.html) in multiple countries. The company's Grok AI chatbot and image generator allowed mass-creation and syndication of non-consensual, explicit, deepfake images that were based on photos of real people, including children.

[Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) CEO Musk launched xAI in 2023 alongside 11 other people in an effort to compete with rivals like OpenAI and [Google](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/). The company's stated goal was to "understand the true nature of the universe," according to its website at the time.  

Last week, Musk announced that his rocket company [SpaceX](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/07/elon-musk-wants-to-be-a-trillionaire-how-spacex-xai-tesla-can-get-him-there.html) acquired [xAI](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/02/elon-musk-spacex-xai-ipo.html) ahead of what could be a potentially massive IPO. The record-setting transaction is the largest merger of all time and values SpaceX at $1 trillion and xAI at $250 billion, according to [documents viewed](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/03/musk-xai-spacex-biggest-merger-ever.html) by CNBC.

Musk previously merged xAI with X in a multibillion-dollar deal he announced last March.
