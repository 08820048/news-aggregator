For the 2025 tax year, eligible U.S. taxpayers can [deduct up to $10,000](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/trump-tax-deductions-car-loans-tips-overtime-senior-bonus.html) in auto loan interest under a temporary provision enacted as part of President Donald Trump's [One Big Beautiful Bill Act](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/24/how-to-get-full-big-beautiful-bill-car-loan-interest-tax-break.html).

However, most eligible borrowers will deduct far less, largely because even sizable auto loans don't generate anywhere near $10,000 in interest in a single year. That figure is closer to what borrowers typically pay in total interest over the life of a 72-month new-car loan, [per Edmunds](https://www.edmunds.com/car-loan/how-long-should-my-car-loan-be.html), a car-shopping and automotive data company.

Instead, for most borrowers, the deduction is more likely to provide tax savings measured in hundreds of dollars a year, not thousands, according to automotive research firm Cox Automotive.

Eligibility rules further narrow who can claim the deduction, since it applies only to newly purchased vehicles financed after Dec. 31, 2024, excludes foreign-assembled cars and phases out for higher earners.

"This tax credit is limited, won't be a market mover and is not a tool to substantially address the affordability challenges and high interest rates our market faces," Jeremy Robb, chief economist at Cox Automotive, tells CNBC Make It.

## Who qualifies for the auto loan interest deduction

The auto loan interest deduction was a 2024 [campaign pledge](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/10/trump-car-loan-tax-deductible-harris-election.html) by Trump, enacted starting July 4, 2025 as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The deduction itself is temporary and applies only to tax years 2025 through 2028.

The deduction applies only to loans that meet the following requirements, [per the Internal Revenue Service](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/one-big-beautiful-bill-act-tax-deductions-for-working-americans-and-seniors):

-   The loan must have originated after Dec. 31, 2024 and be secured by the vehicle.
-   The vehicle must be new — loans for used vehicles do not qualify.
-   The vehicle must be for personal use, not business or commercial use.
-   Eligible vehicles include cars, minivans, vans, SUVs, pickup trucks and motorcycles with a gross vehicle weight rating under 14,000 pounds.
-   The vehicle must have undergone final assembly in the United States. That's roughly 50% of vehicles sold in the U.S., according to Cox. 

The $10,000 maximum deduction phases out at higher income levels. For single filers, the phaseout begins at $100,000 of modified adjusted gross income and ends at $150,000. For married couples filing jointly, the phaseout begins at $200,000 and ends at $250,000, [per the IRS](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/one-big-beautiful-bill-provisions-individuals-and-workers).

While eligibility is limited by income and vehicle rules, qualifying taxpayers can claim the break whether they itemize deductions or take the standard deduction.

## Why most buyers won't get close to $10,000

Even among those who qualify, few buyers are likely to see their tax bill reduced by anything close to $10,000.

A 72-month new-car loan with an interest rate of 9.5% on a $48,000 vehicle and a 12.5% down payment would generate roughly $3,800 in interest in the first year, according to analysis from Cox Automotive. Interest costs fall to about $3,200 in the second year and roughly $2,600 in the third year.

While the full amount of interest is deductible, it only reduces the portion of income subject to tax, not taxes owed dollar for dollar. As a result, the actual tax savings are smaller than the interest paid.

Assuming a federal tax rate of about 15% to 20% for new-vehicle buyers, the first-year deduction would translate into less than $750 in tax savings, according to Cox Automotive calculations. In the second year, the savings would fall to about $640 as interest costs decline.

It would take a loan of roughly $112,000 to generate $10,000 in deductible interest in the first year alone, says Robb.

## How to claim the deduction on your tax return

The deduction is claimed on [Schedule 1-A](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/f1040s1a--2025.pdf), an updated attachment to Form 1040, which tax software will complete automatically for most filers.

Taxpayers must include the vehicle identification number, or VIN, on their tax return for any year the deduction is claimed. The VIN is a 17-character number typically visible on the driver's side of the dashboard near the windshield or inside the driver's door frame, and it also appears on vehicle documents such as the title or insurance card. 

Buyers can use the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's [VIN Decoder](https://www.nhtsa.gov/vin-decoder), which identifies a vehicle's assembly plant, to confirm whether it was finally assembled in the United States.

Lenders must provide borrowers with a statement showing the total amount of interest paid on a qualifying vehicle loan.
