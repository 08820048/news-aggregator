[Walmart](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WMT/) is expected to report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday morning as the retail giant and its new CEO chase a future fueled more by digital businesses and artificial intelligence.

Here's what Wall Street analysts surveyed by LSEG are expecting the company to report:

-   **Earnings per share**: 73 cents expected
-   **Revenue**: $190.43 billion expected

Walmart said in November that it expects full-year net sales to climb between 4.8% and 5.1% and adjusted earnings per share to range from $2.58 to $2.63.

Investors are not only looking for a holiday and full-year recap. They're also eager for a better sense of the company's expectations for the year ahead and the priorities for new CEO John Furner, a more than three-decade-long company veteran and former Walmart U.S. CEO [who succeeded Doug McMillon as Walmart's top executive](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/14/walmart-ceo-doug-mcmillon-to-retire-in-january.html) on Feb. 1.

As a retail behemoth, Walmart offers a key snapshot of the U.S. consumer — particularly since it kicks off a batch of earnings reports from other major retailers, including [Home Depot](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/HD/) and [Target.](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TGT/)

"Everybody likes to get a litmus test on how the consumer acted in the quarter and how they are acting quarter to date," said Kate McShane, a retail analyst for Goldman Sachs.

She said Walmart could benefit from some helpful dynamics in the coming months, including tax cuts that were part of President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/)'s tax and spending bill last year that may free up more discretionary spending, especially for middle-income consumers.

Yet there are other mixed indicators about the U.S. economy, such as [lackluster retail sales numbers in December](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/december-retail-sales-were-flat-missing-expectations.html?msockid=2578540bb6d1653606f942cbb7b66437) and concerns about the jobs market and artificial intelligence-related head count cuts, [despite a better-than-expected jobs report for January.](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/jobs-report-january-2026-.html?&amp;doc=108264784) Investors have closely watched inflation and tried to gauge if tariffs will increase prices in the coming weeks and months, too.

Investors largely expect Furner to focus on [similar priorities](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/18/walmart-target-earnings-new-ceos-furner-fiddelke.html) as his predecessor McMillon, such as increasing Walmart's online business, attracting more customers across incomes and ramping up higher-margin businesses like its third-party marketplace and advertising.

However, Walmart is expected to lose the title as the largest retailer by annual revenue on Thursday. [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/) already [surpassed Walmart on quarterly revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/20/amazon-surpasses-walmart-in-revenue-for-first-time-.html) and it is on track to top Walmart on an annual basis. Amazon's core retail unit is the company's biggest revenue driver, but it gets a sizeable chunk of its business from its cloud computing, advertising and seller services businesses.

Along with getting a new CEO, Walmart has hit other milestones lately. Its stock switched [to the tech-heavy Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/walmart-debuts-nasdaq-marking-its-first-day-trading-2025-12-09) in December and its market value [hit $1 trillion earlier this month](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/03/walmart-wmt-hits-1-trillion-market-cap.html?msockid=2578540bb6d1653606f942cbb7b66437).

As of Wednesday's close, shares of the company have climbed about 22% over the past year and about 14% so far this year. That's outpaced the S&P 500's 12% gains over the past year and less than 1% gains year to date.
