Millions of workers without access to a 401(k) or other workplace retirement plan could get a new way to invest — and an annual government match of up to $1,000 — under a proposal from President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/).

"Half of all of working Americans still do not have access to a retirement plan with matching contributions from an employer," Trump said during his [State of the Union address](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/25/takeaways-trump-state-of-the-union-2026.html) Tuesday. "To remedy this gross disparity, I'm announcing that next year my administration will give these often-forgotten American workers … access to the same type of retirement plan offered to every federal worker. We will match your contribution with up to $1,000 each year as we ensure that all Americans can profit from a rising stock market."

Roughly 56 million Americans lack access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan at work, [according to 2025 research](https://www.pew.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2025/06/workers-without-access-to-retirement-benefits-struggle-to-build-wealth) from the Pew Charitable Trusts, an independent public policy nonprofit.

The Trump administration plan would provide a universal savings account to workers, which would be portable if they switch jobs.

## How the new retirement accounts would work

The new accounts would work similarly to the [Thrift Savings Plan](https://www.tsp.gov/), or TSP, a retirement savings and investment plan for federal employees that includes a government match and low-cost, index-based investment choices, according to the White House. 

How the proposed savings accounts will be taxed remains to be seen, but if they follow the TSP model, contributions could be made on a [tax-advantaged basis](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/31/tax-free-retirement-military.html). Under a traditional TSP, contributions count against income for an up-front tax break, while investors in Roth TSPs contribute post-tax money and can make tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 

Current TSP plan participants receive matching contributions from the federal government equal to up to 5% of the employee's salary.

The $1,000 matching contributions in the President's proposal may involve pairing the new accounts with the [Saver's Match](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/06/whos-eligible-for-the-savers-match.html), a provision in Secure 2.0 that takes effect in 2027, according to White House officials. Starting that year, workers under certain income thresholds can earn a 50% matching contribution from Uncle Sam on up to $2,000 in annual retirement savings. 

## Which workers are 'left out of the system'

Trump's proposal is "a recognition of reality," said Teresa Ghilarducci, a professor at The New School who co-authored 2021 [research](https://eig.org/inclusive-wealth-building-initiative) with National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett on providing low-income workers with retirement savings similar to the Thrift Savings Plan.

Ghilarducci said the new account would be a "meaningful step to get universal coverage" for retirement savings.

"Many, many people who are left out of the system will start accumulating for retirement," Ghilarducci said, and can reap the rewards of compound interest.

Low-income workers often lack access to workplace retirement savings plans. Nearly 80% of workers without an employer-sponsored retirement plan earn less than $53,000 per year, according to [AARP](https://www.aarp.org/advocacy/state-of-the-union-2026), a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization representing individuals 50 and over.

Workers at small businesses are more likely not to have a retirement plan at work, as 78% of businesses with fewer than 10 employees do not offer that benefit, AARP research found. 

Many of those workers tend to be young, female or minorities, Ghilarducci said.

About 63% of Hispanic workers, 52% of Black workers and 44% of Asian Americans lack access to a retirement savings plan at work, according to AARP.

## Key account details yet to be determined

Retirement experts are "cautiously optimistic" that the proposal could be a game changer to help people get access to 401(k) style plans, said Jason Fichtner, senior fellow at the National Academy of Social Insurance, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization focused on strengthening social insurance programs.

The question is how the plan would work so that everyone has access to it, Fichtner said.

"We need to make sure it's additive and doesn't subtract from any of the other social welfare programs we have that help lower-income people," Fichtner said.

For example, some low-income Americans rely on Supplemental Security Income benefits. However, those beneficiaries face [strict asset limits](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/30/ssi-benefits-provide-a-safety-net-but-come-with-strict-asset-limits.html) of $2,000 per individual and $3,000 per married couple. The new retirement accounts could be structured so that assets held within them don't apply to the SSI limits, or Congress could raise those thresholds through broader reform, Fichtner said.

"The most important thing that you can give people and families in our retirement system is an easy way to get started," said KC Boas, retirement savings initiative lead at the Aspen Institute Financial Security Program, which focuses on helping people at all income levels achieve financial security.

With the new retirement accounts, lawmakers will need to consider details such as how to ensure portfolios are diversified and whether, as with [Trump accounts](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/21/trump-accounts.html) for kids, they will allow outside contributions, she said.

They also need to consider whether there will be a liquidity feature to allow for [emergency withdrawals](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/15/emergency-savings-401ks.html) alongside long-term savings, Boas said.

"So many retirement accounts today are treated as de facto emergency savings vehicles when they're not," Boas said. "And we know the impact that that has on people's balances at retirement and the setback that it can cause."
