The Seattle Seahawks are officially up for sale.

The NFL team, which defeated the New England Patriots in the [2026 Super Bowl](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/nearly-125-million-watch-seahawks-crush-patriots-in-super-bowl-lx.html) earlier this month, [announced](https://x.com/Seahawks/status/2024183026947936450?s=20) on Wednesday that it has begun a process through which it could sell the franchise. The process, led by investment bank Allen & Co. and law firm Latham & Watkins, is expected to continue through the 2026 offseason.

The Seahawks franchise is owned by the estate of Paul Allen, the [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/) co-founder who helmed the Seahawks from 1997 until his death in 2018. His sister, Jody Allen, became executor of his estate after his death and took over the leadership of the franchise, overseeing the sale of his assets and donations to charity.

"The Estate of Paul G. Allen today announced it has commenced a formal sale process for the Seattle Seahawks NFL franchise, consistent with Allen's directive to eventually sell his sports holdings and direct all Estate proceeds to philanthropy," the franchise wrote on social media.

Prior to the Seahawks' most recent Super Bowl win, the Seattle team was valued at roughly $7 billion, according to [CNBC's official NFL valuations](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/04/cnbcs-official-nfl-team-valuations-2025.html). In that range, the sale has the potential to become one of the biggest in NFL history, after the Washington Commanders sold for roughly $6 billion in 2023.

A sale would be finalized after NFL owners ratify a purchase agreement, according to the Seahawks.
