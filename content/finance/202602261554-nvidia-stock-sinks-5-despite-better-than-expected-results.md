[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/) stock sank 5% on Thursday, as investor concerns around the artificial intelligence infrastructure boom dampened enthusiasm about its better-than-expected earnings.

Revenue for its [fiscal fourth-quarter](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/25/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q4-2026.html) hit $68.13 billion, ahead of analyst estimates of $66.21 billion, according to LSEG. Total revenue climbed 73% from the figure Nvidia reported a year ago and guidance also came in ahead of expectations.

"The debate has shifted away from near-term results and toward the sustainability of AI capex spending, amid concerns around its quantum, monetisation and potential cashflow degradation," Richard Clode, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, told CNBC by email.

## Investor AI concerns

Hyperscalers saw more than [$1 trillion wiped](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/06/ai-sell-off-stocks-amazon-oracle.html) from their market caps at the start of February, before paring those losses in recent weeks.

Semiconductor maker [Advanced Micro Devices](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMD/) [fell 17%](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/04/amd-stock-earnings-forecast-chips.html) after reporting guidance that topped expectations for many analysts earlier this month, though some had predicted a stronger outlook.

"The market is currently fighting broad-based AI concerns," said Dan Hanbury, global strategic equity co-portfolio manager at Ninety One.

"What is weighing heavy on investors' minds is how Nvidia can maintain its phenomenal growth rate now its core customers — the hyperscalers — are mostly depleting their cash flows, spending on AI-related capex."

## Data centers fuel growth

Nvidia's data center unit, which houses its market-leading chips, fuelled its revenue boom, bringing in 91% of sales.

Data center revenue came in at $62.3 billion for the quarter, ahead of expectations for $60.69 billion, according to StreetAccount.

Nvidia issued an upbeat guidance with revenue for the fiscal first-quarter to be $78 billion, plus or minus 2%, well above analysts' forecast for $72.6 billion.

"The guidance of $78bn in revenues was well ahead of even the most bullish buyside expectations and the fourth straight quarter of accelerating growth in contrast to concerns around a slowdown," said Clode.
