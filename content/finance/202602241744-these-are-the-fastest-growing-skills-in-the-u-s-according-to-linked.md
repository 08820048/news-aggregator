What [skills can help make you more attractive](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/09/upwork-fastest-growing-in-demand-skills-companies-are-hiring-for.html) in the job market or workplace today?

LinkedIn's 2026 Skills on the Rise [list](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-skills-rise-2026-fastest-growing-us-linkedin-news-nujwe/), published Tuesday, identifies the fastest-growing skills in the U.S.

"We've seen the skills required to do our jobs evolve dramatically in the last 10 years, with even more change on the way, largely fueled by AI," Andrew Seaman, LinkedIn News Senior Editor-at-Large for Jobs & Career Development, tells CNBC Make It. "Employers are looking less at job titles or degrees and more at what people can actually do."

The list was determined by analyzing year-over-year growth in "skill acquisition" and "hiring success" from Dec. 1, 2024 to Nov. 30, 2025, compared to the period from Dec. 1, 2023 to Nov. 30, 2024. The report looked at the increase in [LinkedIn members](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/14/dont-make-this-mistake-when-using-chatgpt-on-your-linkedin-profile.html) adding a given skill to their profiles (skill acquisition) and the increase in members with a given skill who got hired during that period (hiring success).

LinkedIn grouped individual fast-growing skills into broader categories based on use cases and other factors.

"Think of your skills like career currency — they help determine who gets hired, who gets promoted, and who's tapped for new projects," Seaman says. "Even as industries evolve or companies change, skills are what give you flexibility and resilience, especially in an [uncertain job market](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/16/long-term-unemployment-becoming-a-status-quo-in-todays-job-market.html)."

Here are the top categories in LinkedIn's 2026 skills on the rise list and some of the individual skills that fall under each:

-   **AI engineering and implementation**, including data annotation and prompt engineering
-   **Operational efficiency**, including logistics management and process optimization
-   **AI business strategy**, including data governance and responsible AI
-   **Executive and stakeholder communications**, including public speaking and relationship development
-   **Financial operations and reporting**, including cash reporting and financial data analysis
-   **Leadership and people management**, including cross-functional team management and talent development
-   **Business revenue growth**, including account development and go-to-market strategy
-   **Risk compliance management**, including policy compliance and safety monitoring

The list is a mix of "hard" skills, particularly in AI, and "soft" skills like communication and people management.

"Those \[who\] embrace AI, are curious with the technology, and use it in their daily work will be seen as the future leaders at each company," [LinkedIn COO Dan Shapero previously told Make It](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/02/hiring-managers-are-increasingly-looking-for-ai-skills-says-linkedin-coo.html). AI literacy was the top skill on [LinkedIn's 2025 Skills on the Rise list](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/19/fast-growing-skills-employers-want-to-see-on-your-resume-linkedin-report.html).

Soft skills like conflict mitigation, adaptability and innovative thinking made up roughly half of LinkedIn's 2025 list. They're crucial to our day-to-day work, [Andrew McCaskill, formerly a career expert at LinkedIn, previously told Make It](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/02/the-top-soft-skills-you-need-to-get-hired-in-2025-according-to-linkedin.html). "Human-centric skills" like these, he said, are "really game changers."
