SpaceX CEO Elon Musk on Wednesday announced the the company's xAI artificial intelligence venture implemented a reorganization that "required parting ways with some people."

The overhaul was done "to improve speed of execution," Musk said in a [post](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2021673886157607383) on X. He did not say which employees may have been cut as a result of the restructuring or which employees may have resigned of their own volition.

"We are hiring aggressively," Musk added.

Earlier this week, xAI co-founders [Jimmy Ba](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/musks-xai-loses-second-co-founder-in-two-days-as-jimmy-ba-departs.html) and [Tony Wu](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/elon-musk-xai-co-founder-tony-wu.html) announced their exits after several other founding members, including [Igor Babuschkin](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/13/elon-musks-xai-loses-co-founder-igor-babuschkin-for-venture-firm.html), Kyle Kosic, Christian Szegedy and [Greg Yang](https://x.com/TheGregYang/status/2013652609455006006?s=20), previously departed.

[Last week](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/02/elon-musk-spacex-xai-ipo.html), Musk announced a record-setting, all-stock transaction in which SpaceX, the aerospace and defense juggernaut, acquired xAI, which owns and operates social network X and is the developer of Grok, the embattled AI chatbot and image generator.

The deal valued SpaceX at $1 trillion and xAI at $250 billion post merger, according to [documents viewed](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/03/musk-xai-spacex-biggest-merger-ever.html) by CNBC. Musk previously used xAI to acquire X, formerly Twitter, in another all-stock transaction announced in [March 2025](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/28/elon-musk-says-xai-has-acquired-x-in-deal-that-values-social-media-site-at-33-billion.html).

The co-founder departures and the re-org this week come as SpaceX prepares to [go public](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/11/musk-says-spacex-report-of-2026-ipo-is-accurate.html) sometime this year and while xAI faces [regulatory probes](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/05/india-eu-investigate-musks-x-after-grok-created-deepfake-child-porn.html) in multiple jurisdictions across Europe, Asia and the U.S.

The probes are looking into whether xAI violated regional regulations after [Grok enabled](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/02/musk-grok-ai-bot-safeguard-sexualized-images-children.html) mass-creation and syndication of non-consensual, explicit images, colloquially known as deepfake porn. The images were based on photos of real people, including children.

Musk launched xAI in 2023 alongside 11 other people in an effort to compete against [OpenAI](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/openai-cnbc-disruptor-50.html) and [Google](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/). The company's stated goal was to "understand the true nature of the universe," according to its website at the time.
