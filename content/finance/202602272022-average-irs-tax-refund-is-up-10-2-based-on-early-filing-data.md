The [average tax refund](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/20/trump-tax-refunds.html) is 10.2% higher so far this season, compared to about the same period in 2025, according to the latest IRS filing data. The year-over-year percentage change is down from the [14.2% increase reported last week](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/20/average-irs-tax-refund.html).

As of Feb. 20, the [average refund amount](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/filing-season-statistics-for-week-ending-feb-20-2026) for individual filers was $3,804, up from $3,453 about one year prior, the IRS reported on Friday.

The total amount refunded was about $109 billion, up 6.9% from 2025, according to the IRS release. But the total returns processed were down by 2.4%.

Amid consumer [concerns about affordability](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/24/affordability-is-a-buzzword-right-now-these-charts-show-why.html), the Trump administration has emphasized how Trump's ["big beautiful bill"](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/03/trump-big-beautiful-bill-tax-changes.html) may impact the size of tax refunds this season.

In a [late January release](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2026/01/president-trump-delivers-largest-tax-refund-season-in-u-s-history/), the White House said average tax refunds could increase "by $1,000 or more," citing several media reports that reference early October research from investment bank Piper Sandler. 

A Feb. 26 report from Oxford Economics estimates that tax refunds will jump by nearly 20% this year, with more benefits flowing to middle- and upper-income households than usual, based on changes enacted via [Trump's 2025 tax cuts](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/03/trump-big-beautiful-bill-tax-changes.html).

However, individual refunds could vary based on 2025 [paycheck withholdings](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/14/withhold-taxes-paycheck.html) and which of Trump's provisions impact their family's situation, experts say.

## Average tax refunds typically increase by late February

By law, the IRS can't send refunds claiming the [earned income tax credit](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/27/earned-income-tax-credit-eligibility-2025.html) or the refundable part of the [child tax credit](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/06/trump-child-tax-credit.html), known as the additional child tax credit or ACTC, until Feb. 15. 

That means the agency's first two [filing season statistics](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/filing-season-statistics-by-year) releases, reflecting data through Feb. 6 and Feb. 13, respectively, did not include the millions of refunds with these credits.

"As we head into late February, the average refund size pops — it gets larger," said Andrew Lautz, director of tax policy for the Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonprofit think tank.

From Feb. 13 to Feb. 20, the average tax refund size jumped from $2,476 to $3,804. But with limited tax filing data, it's too early to make conclusions about average tax refunds this season, experts say.

For 2025 returns, the maximum EITC is [worth up to $8,046](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/earned-income-tax-credit/earned-income-and-earned-income-tax-credit-eitc-tables) for filers with three or more qualifying children. For 2024 returns, the [average EITC payment](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-joins-national-partners-to-launch-eitc-awareness-day) was $2,916, according to the IRS. Trump's tax cuts did not change the EITC for 2025.

Trump's legislation made permanent a higher [child tax credit](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/06/trump-child-tax-credit.html) and boosted the maximum tax break to $2,200. The refundable portion, ACTC, will continue to adjust to inflation, but Trump's cuts did not change the amount from 2024. The ACTC is worth up to $1,700 for 2025.
